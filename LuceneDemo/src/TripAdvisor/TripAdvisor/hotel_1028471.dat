<Content>A calm oasis close to the city attractions This was our first time to Berlin, part of a self-planned six week tour of the UK, Belgium and Germany. With so many nights in hotels, we were working to a budget and looking for a clean, comfortable, good value-for-money hotel for our three days in Berlin. The Klassik completely surpassed our expectations. The hotel is new (refurbished in April 2008), with nice decor and public areas. Rooms were spotlessly clean and functional. Breakfast was included in our rate of 85 Euros and the staff were very friendly and helpful. All the front of house and dining room staff spoke good English. The Klassik is well situated for public transport with tram, U-Bahn and S-Bahn services nearby. The only minor issue we experienced with the staff was when we asked for an iron to press some clothes, only to be told that for security reasons (??) they couldn't let us take an iron to our room! However, as an alternative, the employee offered to have the items pressed and returned to our room at no charge. This was done within 15 minutes.The hotel is very conveniently situated for both U-Bahn and S-Bahn stations (Warschauer Stra脽e) - only a couple of hundred yards away. On the S-Bahn it is three stops to Alexanderplatz, the gateway to the major city centre attractions.We travelled there by car and although the hotel has no parking spaces, there is a considerable amount of free street parking immediately outside the hotel.Two cautions, firstly the hotel is located in a busy part of Prenzlauer-Berg, a district popular with young Berliners and visitors for its cafe, bar and club scene. (I read somewhere there are three nightclubs under the U-Bahn station!). We were there Sat/Sun/Monday nights and although Saturday was especially busy, the place is noisy 24 hours a day. The Klassik is a (relatively) quiet oasis in the midst of the 24 hour mayhem of Prenzlauer-Berg!Second, Wikipaedia describes Prenzlauer-Berg as one of the prettiest areas in Berlin. If this is so, we didn't see those parts! The area around the hotel is very untidy - the streets are littered with garbage and broken glass -- and it seemed every available square inch of wall was covered in graffitti. Prenzlauer-Berg was in East Berlin - maybe that has something to do with the run down look of the area? To get a better idea of what I mean, check out the hotel location and the neighbourhood photos on Google Earth.The area seemed safe - although there was a lot of noise (maybe I'm getting too old and grumpy) - we didn't see anything to suggest the area isn't safe. Our rental car sat parked on the street outside the hotel for three days untouched.Finally, the acid test! Would I stay there again if I returned to Berlin? If the Klassik were in a quieter location, definitely YES -- where it is, MAYBE. At 85 Euros this was great value for money. We had three nights for well under 300 Euros -- this is the cost of one night at a city centre hotel! If I didn't stay at the Klassik it would be because of the neighbourhood, not the hotel!
