<Content>Dirty and Noisy Staying at the Gutenberg hotel? in Barcelona was the worst part of my trip to Spain. This place is little more than a hostel. The room with kitchenette was dirty from wall to wall. People had their doors open while playing their music and people were noisy walking through the hallways. The staff at the hostel were of no service during my visit. Don't stay here unless you have very xpectations.

<Content>Simple and comfortable with good location and friendly staff We enjoyed our stay at the Gutenberg, my brother and I just wanted somewhere clean and comfortable right in the centre. The Gutenberg was great value when compared to other hotels of similar location and standard. The room was also a good size and we were lucky enough to get a small balcony...although it rained all weekend! The staff were great, happy to advise and remembered your name and then greeted you by name each time we returned...that counts. Room was basic, with tiled floor and 2 single beds, it was very clean as was the bathroom. Breakfast was simple, cereal, toast or croissant, and the coffee suprisingly drinkable. Its less than a minutes walk from the Ramblas, Gothic Quarter and Port, making it a great base.

<Content>Roach motel! We booked this hotel due to good reviews on more than one web site. Either those folks had a much different experience than us or they lied. This hotel is a complete dump. The elevators barely fit two people and two suitcases. The room had a roach in it and the shower was FULL of mold. It was just disgusting. My bf took pictures and went down to the desk to discuss with the staff. They tried to find another room, but it honestly took them two or three more rooms to find one that was acceptable. We turned it down and checked out the next morning. We spoke to the manager the next morning, showing him the photos. He said that his desk staff showed us 5 rooms (not true) and we declined them all. He said he didn't know where those photos were taken and refused to come up to the room to see for himself. He also said he would have to think about whether or not to refund us the two nights we would not be staying there (we paid in advance through the website), although we gave notice the previous night that we would not be staying there. As of now (a week later), we have not received the refund.

<Content>great location Just returned from a weekend break for my friends 50th birthday.There was 8 men in 1 double and 2 triple rooms. We all agreed that the Hotel was in a perfect location and it was a very good Hotel. The staff on the desk were very friendly, helpful and spoke good english. The Hotel had the feel of a family run Hotel as opposed to a corporate Hotel. Breakfast was served in a pleasant room and was quite adequate for us.I agree with some previous reviews, the surrounding streets can be a little intimidating at night, best to approach from main road and a quick left into reception, but I must say, we did not encounter any problems and we used the side streets to get to Hotel.The Ramblas is a 2 minute walk away and the marina is just 5 minutes away.All of us would stay at this Hotel without hesitation, again.

<Content>very pleased considering reasonable rates We are a couple aged 45 years. We had a limited budget and found the rates for this hotel extremely good comparing to other hotels in the area. We travelled with Ryanair and used the transfer coach (21 euros return). From there we continued on the metro (4 stops) and stopped at Drassanes. From this stop the hotel was approx 2 mins. The position of this hotel is fantastic, just on a little street off the Ramblas situated at the port end. We did not find the hotel vicinity threatening or dangerous as other reviews have quoted. The hotel reception staff were very helpful, speaking good english and able to assist on a few trips we had planned to try. We had requested a double bed as most rooms are twin and were very happy to have a double bed in our room. The rooms were good sized with sofabed, kitchen with fridge/cooking facilities. Also bathroom complete with bath/shower/bidet/sink etc. (hot water always available). We also had a balcony but views were of the streets, though we still enjoyed watching the world go by with a bottle of wine. Breakfast was continental with a good choice of bread/ham/cheeses, yoghurts, cereals, omelletes, sausages, toast marmalade/jam etc. Also fruit juice, tea coffee available.We had read reviews regarding noise in the hotel and we noticed that there were groups of older school children who were a little noisy when leaving the rooms but the noise at night was fine. I had taken ear plugs after reading reviews but didnt use them.Our overall stay at this hotel was great, i cant really complain about any of it.If you want any info regarding the hotel please email me on jackiehuller@hotmail.com

<Content>Good customer service. Two couples travelling, we arrived at Hotel at 6pm Saturday evening (day before Barcelona Marathon) and found that the website we booked through had cancelled our booking. The staff were very helpful even though they said they couldn't accommodate us in the two twin rooms which we had originally booked. They offered us a quad room on the top floor for the first night which was very spacious and modern and much better than we had hoped. The next day our friends were offered a twin room and we were allowed to stay for the rest of the trip in the quad room. The hotel is clean, central and close to La Ramblas and we didn't feel threatened when returning to the Hotel late at night ,despite it being near the so called red light district. A buffet breakfast was included in the price which had a very good variety to choose from and set us up for the day. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Hotel? Hostel ... This hotel will be OK if you don't intend to spend any time in it and plan on partying until the early hours every morning. If you want a quiet, relaxing hotel in which you can chill and get some sleep after a long days sightseeing please look elsewhere.The location is great, just off the Ramblas and a five minute walk from the port. There are some good offers around and rooms are quite cheap. Rooms are clean but basic. All this would be fine - apart from the noise. The hotel has small balconies overlooking a grotty street which the whole world seems to hang out on all night. You will be lucky to get an hours sleep unless you drink a few bottles of Cava first. The hotel is full of school parties who slammed doors and ran up and down the corridors from morning until night. Breakfast is alright, but the queues are so long you may consider going to a local cafe to guarantee a seat.I hate moany reviews but my heart did sink when it was time to go back to the hotel and it is sadly the worst I have ever been in.Barca is a great city and you will have a brilliant time. Maybe I'm just too old for this hotel . If you are eighteen then Gutenberg may be may be just right - otherwise stay somewhere else.

<Content>Pratical If you don't intent to spend too much time in your hotel, this is a good option. I've been there for 4 days (from 7 to 10th of June), and it was a good decision. The hotel is situated near Ramblas, but not in the main road, so it seems a little strange on first approach. Nevertheless, you will not feel unsafe if you enter thru the main street (avoid the secondary streets, especially at night). If you already know Barcelona, and the Ramblas, you know that at night some precautions must be taken. Take the subway during day, and taxi at night. Positive: Price, Location (near rambla, subway station, maremagnum, columbus plaza - taxis), people friendly, clean.Negative: Near narrow secondary streets, noisy, poor room sound proof, no bar, and no restaurant (for dinner). The break-first is sufficient. The price compensate 70% of all negative aspects...

<Content>Not clean We stayed in the hotel Gutenberg for Three nights in August. We wanted to spend a bit more than a one or a two star hotel because we appreciate a bit of confort and cleanless...The hall was ok, breakfast also ok, but when we came into our bedroom, we saw lots of hairs on the floor, like if nobody made the housekeeping. The sheets of the bed got some hairs in it, and my pillow had some yellow tracks. The bathroom had also some big hair!!!!! Disgusting...I called the reception and asked for somebody to come and see.She called a women to change the sheets and to clean the floor.They changed the sheets, new sheets had still some hairs on... wow... and they took a floorcloth to clean the floor. That means she just deplace the dirtiness from place to place in the bedroom. they dont have any hoover, that is definitly disgusting!!!!!!!i am used to travel in that range of hotels, but i have never seen that problem!!!!!

<Content>Perfect for a weeks break in Barca If you're a young couple or group without a great deal of money then Apartmento Gutenberg is worth considering!My girlfriend and I stayed there whilst doing the tourist thing in Barca and it is clean comfortable central and close to the places you want to be!Food is good, staff are very friendly and the rooms are spotless. We had a studio bedroom ensuite with kitchenette and balcony. The view is non existent as the hotel is down a side street, but if you're using it as a base only then it shouldn't be a problem.We are going back to Barca again this year and will be staying there again, I was very impressed with the hotel.The foyer is very nice and they have internet access for guests in the lobby, the photographs you may have see online don't do it justice either!I would give the hotel 10 out of 10!! Really enjoyed my stay!!

<Content>Good basic hotel close to las ramblas This hotel can only be described as suitable for budget travellers. I stayed with some colleagues from work in September 2005. It served it's purpose well as a 'crash-pad' for a big night out in Barcelona.The hotel is located one block off the world famous Las ramblas (Plaza colon end). It is bordering the red light district so it can get a little dodgy later in the evening. In terms of situation the hotel is perfect for short breaks and stags or hens. The rooms are ensuite if a little cramped and the foyer is where they have spent most of their refurbishment budget, the lifts worked and there was minimal noise while we were there.There is a great little bar just beside the hotel to the left, a real sense of how the catalans enjoy life in their capital. Menu's of the day for 8 euro including 3 courses and a glass of wine of beer. Again basic but authentic.i hope you enjoy the best city in europe, I certainly did and am looking forward to getting back.

<Content>Clean  I stayed there in September with friends on a hen weekend. The appartments are handy for La Rambla and are within two minutes of the underground network.The area is slightly seedy although none of us felt threatened at any stage. In fact the nearest bar was a transvestite bar and the 'regulars' were all very friendly and welcomed our group. Tha apartments were very clean and excellent value for money. The Breakfast room was also clean and the continental breakfast was adequate with plenty of rolls, croissants, cheese, ham, juices and coffee. I am recommending these Apartments to all my friends who are visiting Barca.
