<Content>Nightmare weekend When I first arrive to the hotel I went directly to the reception and she charge my credit card for the total amount of the stay (4 nights) without showing my room. When I went to my room, it was completely full of mosquitoes. I went back to the recepcionist and she was looking for spray to kill them forgetting that it was a room with air conditioning and no ventilation. I request another room. At the beginning, she told me that there was no room available like the one I had. I agree to move to smaller room and when I turn the air conditioning on, there were more mosquitoes in this room, the bed sheets smelled horrible, the bath tub had a big leak and the curtains were full of dirt. Then, I decide to cancel the reservation and go back to my home although the trip was two and half hours. When I went to the receptionist to make the arrangements for my money, they told me that the policy of the hotel was that if you do a cancellation they will not return the money back independently of the situation. So, they didn't gave me my money and I can't stay at the facilities. My children were very sad and my husband and I were upset because they take the money and didn't giving us the service we deserve.

<Content>Bad idea! I wish we had checked the reviews here before going to this place. We can only agree with all the bad reviews. The only positive was that the staff at the restaurant were friendly and the food was decent. Not sure about the drinks served in plastic Solo cups though. The bed in the room was so bad that we ended up leaving at 4 AM because we just couldn't stand laying in bed anymore. The mattress seemed to be made out of wood...my back still hurts two days later! Also the beach was a joke! Don't stay there! It ruined our trip!

<Content>Terrible The so-called beach was about 100 feet long., that was it...the mattress in Rm 118 were terrible...both beds were covered in vinyl and were so hard it would have been better to sleep on the floor. The bed spreads were dirty and stained. No wash cloths provided and none available when asked. Ice was kept in a cooler by the front desk...half melted. After a rain, the walk ways were flooded up to the outside doors of some of the rooms. You had to wear a paper wrist band the entire time you were there so they would know you were a quest at the hotel. We found this Hotel on the Internet and the pictures are very deceiving. The swimming pool was littered with leaves and very small. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Save your money and go to a Holiday Inn...

<Content>Little beach hotel on seafood row We checked into this small beach front hotel for one night and extended our stay, day by day, for three additional nights., each at $90 per. Staff and manager couldn't have been more helpful, they even let us use their front desk PC to view Trip Advisor to help plan our next stop in Ponce. When we were there in mid-January the place was almost empty but the snack bar/restaurant was open daily so we could grab coffee or whatever each morning.The hotel has a small, very secluded, private beach which is shared with the low rise condo next store. Room was large and clean but sparsely furnished.A nice get away from it all place during the slow winter season in these parts.

<Content>Cockroaches As we entered the Hotel area we didnt like it, but we had already the reservation so we couldnt do anything. We went to the front desk and the person in the counter didnt had a very good humor. After that we went to our room, once we got inside the room we found roaches, I went down and told the front desk person and they came up in the room and killed them. We left to go eat something and when we came back inside the room there were more roaches, we took pictures and I went down again and complained. I told them I didnt want to stay in the hotel, and I wanted my money back. The front desk lady said they dont give the money back, and that was in the contract we signed, so I wanted to speak to a manager and she said he was not there. The lady called him and he said to give me back the money but they will have to charge $112. Before leaving the hotel there was a cockroach by the front desk, so i guess the whole hotel is full of cockroaches. I dont recommend this hotel to anyone, and for the price you could stay in other hotels, that are clean and nice.

<Content>Lost Items not returned My friend booked the room, but on our departure I realized that I had left my diamond ring, have called the hotel and talked with the lady that cleaned my room, she stated that she had found the ring and would give to management so that it would be mailed to Maryland, but as of this date I have not received my package. Several calls have been made and I keep getting the run around. The lady at the desk keeps telling my friend that no one in managment is around.

<Content>Never stay here! Never consider this hotel if you want to have a good time or at least a friendly, respectable staff. I considered this hotel because of the information in the Frommers travel guide. I made a reservation for two days by phone and asked about the water and swimming conditions. They told me there was clean, clear water and that there were few waves and good snorkneling conditions. When we came there it was exactly the opposite. The water was not clean but dirty and muddy, there were lots of waves and stones sticking out of the water and near hotel there was a lot of garbage. We told them it's not what they told us about the hotel and it wasn't acceptable and we can't stay here. We asked to speak to manager, but he refused to meet us. As a result we idn't stay at this hotel and they charged our credit card 112$ because of their cancellation policy. Do not stay at this hotel!!!

<Content>Definately not the place!! we went to the joyuda beach resort 12/26/04 thru 12/29 04. we were not expecting anything great. we traveled p.r. for 10 days for the second time and once out of san juan your not really going to get fancy hotels. this hotel looked ok fom the outside. checked in at 11:00 a.m. the would not let us into the room until 4:00 even though there was hardly anyone there. no problem there were plenty of restaurants in the area to have lunch. we got into the hotel room. after a little examination the place is not really kept up. mold in the corners as well as all along the bottom of the tub, nevermind 6 or 7 guwee things on the bathroom door. still no problem, i was not expecting much. we got settled in and went to the hotel beach. there is about 20 ft of sand, total rocks as soon as you touch the water. no swimming! might not be a problem for some people but it is a non smoking hotel inside and out. we went out exploring, down to boquonron (cool little town) as well as the el faro (lighthouse) as well as a couple of cool beaches. came back to the hotel then went out for dinner in joyuda (ok). went to bed, to my surprise the king bed matress is wrapped in plastic and fitted with 2 sets of twin flat sheets which were wrapped around us in the morning with parts of our bodies on the plastic. still ok with it. went to get a shower, it pretty much dribbled out. i went to the desk to complain. she said she would take care of it. we took off for the afternoon, came back, still a dribble. complained again, said the maintenance person is no longer there, they will fix it in the morning. morning came and still no shower and then we left. i wasn't expecting to much but a shower that worked corectly is 1 of the most important, never mind the cleanliness and bed. simply we will never go back again even though we will be back to cabo rojo.

<Content>The website looks much better than the real thing! We just came back from Joyuda Beach two weeks ago. We stayed at the Joyuda Beach hotel for 3 nights. Not very impressed by it. The hotel smells and I got bitten by something in bed and felt itchy the whole time. The room is very basic, worst than a Day脗 s inn by American Standard. We had a king bed but they didn't have King bed sheet. So they put two full sheets together to make the bed. The beach is not a good siwmming beach. It has very shallow water about 2 feet the most. The beach is tiny and the sand is not fine. You can't go too far out since there is a breaker between the beach and the ocean. The reef just off the hotel is all dead and so you can't do snorkeling either. We ended up go to Boqueron for swimming and Gilligan's Island for snorkeling.The website photo looks much prettier than the real thing!We asked the staff where was a good place to eat, the only thing they would recommended was the hotel restaurant. In fact, there are plenty of best PR seafood restaurants nearby.The only good thing with the hotel is it is cheap. We only paid $65 including tax per week night. And it is close to all the good seafood restaurants and it is pretty convenient to all the attractions in west PR. If you do decide to stay there, call the hotel directly. You'll get better deal than through some hotel booking websites.
