<Content>Friendly and restful Hello everybody, You are looking for a peaceful and welcoming place to rest in Amsterdam's lively atmosphere, just in front of Vondelpark ? You want to be as close as possible from Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum (the resaons why you are in Amsterdam)? Breakfast in bed is for you the sine qua non condition for great holidays ? Your budget must be relatively watched out ?... if you answer 'yes' to at least one out of these four questions, then I recommand you Wynnobel Hotel. Very friendly and welcoming owners (among whom one plays the piano for you), speaking French perfectly if needed ; peaceful and quite large rooms, very clean shared bathroom ; a little aside from the lively center, just enough to enjoy a rest but not far at all from Leidseplein and all its restaurants and bars ; the great museums are just a little walk far and the tramway bring you directly from Centraal Station.Recommanded by the French well-known Guide du Routard but would need a website...A hotel that makes you want to come back to Amsterdam ! *
