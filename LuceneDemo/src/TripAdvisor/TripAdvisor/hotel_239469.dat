<Content>OK Physically, Insane Staff If you are in Amsterdam to see the seedy sights, location wise it's hard to beat the Kabul. This place was actually about average on the cleanliness scale for a hostel. The carpets are stained, and it's a bit dingy, but it is located dead center in the Red Light, so I wasn't expecting posh accommodations. The bathrooms were sanitary and serviceable, and while the blankets and sheets were worn they had been washed recently. I've honestly stayed in much, much filthier hostels and you have a decent view of the canals in the room we stayed in, which was one of the large 8 bed rooms. My real problem was with the staff. We stayed here 5 days, and on the morning of the second day we were out the door pretty early. In the lobby, one of the clerks and an Italian woman (looked to be a teenager) were screaming and fighting with each other. I have no idea what they were fighting about, but the clerk kicked this woman in the chest and sent her sprawling onto the ground where she could hardly breathe. I'm sure being a hotel clerk in this part of Amsterdam can be trying, but I've never seen anyone just make the jump from an argument to physical violence in a business setting like that. It definitely scared us, and had we not foolishly paid in advance, we would have left and found somewhere else to stay.

<Content>If you got choise go somewhere else When I arrived with my friend to this [--] hostel 2 girls from Argentina were accommodated. they were very friendly and very helpful and that will be all good thinks with this hostel. Hostel is DIRTY(dirty sheets, no closets,), STINKY, and expensive I pay 25 euro for one night (thank goodness it was only one night!!) in the 16 Bed Dorm. I you got choise go somewhere else !!! I RECOMMEND SHELTER HOSTEL (clean, good breakfast, friendly staff) very nice hostel near red district. www.shelter.nl.

<Content>No Thrills, butDoes the job. To be blunt, Hotel Kabul is not bad and not brilliant. If you want all mod cons and cant even leave the house without holding your mums hand then forget about it. On the other side, if you and a few mates want a cheap stay in Amsterdam, positioned smack bang where the action is, and are willing to take refuge in slightly shabby accomodation then this place comes recommended. Staff were friendly enough which is always a good thing. I stayed in a room in a party of 5, we had a locker and a radiator, a big window but it didn't open very far, two bunks and a single. Don't expect much in terms of cleanliness but as I said if you want a cheap getaway you cant expect too much. Shared toliet and washin facilities but we did have a small sink in the room.Phil Blunt - Oxford, UK

<Content>Additional Commentary to the previous ones I just returned today from Amsterdan. I agree 100% with the comments above and still have one cherry to put on the top of all that: my digital camera and mp3 player which were inside my bag which was inside the lockers was stolen by one of my roomates. It is not a big surprise something like that happening considering that a considerable amount of junkies are among the clients.

<Content>What a bunch of moaners! Come on,you get what you pay for.I've stayed here numerous times and although the place may not be the ritz,it's an adventure in it's own right! It's location is good for the cafes and if the red light is just around the corner if you fancy a shag!Unless the place collapses into the canal(which is probable)I shall be returning.JW

<Content>Hey, this place isn't so bad! I spent a week in Poland in what I felt was an excellent hostel. I came to Kabul in Amsterdam expecting the same but boy was I suprised. It stank, the staff weren't friendly and there were strange insects around. But my roommates were cool and we were allowed to smoke bongs in our room and drink beer. It's so close as well to all the nightlife and the train station. If you want a clean room with excellent service then don't go there. But if you pick up gear from a coffee shop and want to smoke it in your room then go to Kabul. Well dodgy place, but I liked my roommates, especially a Finnish guy  Japanese guy who liked their smoke. A good night. You wouln't be able to do that in another Dam hostel. But watch out for the bugs. Well skanking.

<Content>The worst hostel in the world I have stayed at some awful places on my travels but this one really is the pits....rooms were dirty, bed unchanged from previous visitors and staff rude and unfriendly. They even tried to keep our key deposits when we checked out after one night. I wouldn't book a room here for my worst enemy

<Content>Pigeon Graveyard Do you like pigeons? Does the overpowering aroma of urine set your heart racing? Does the prospect of housing nightly insect feasts on your own flesh fill you with joy? Perhaps sleeping in sauna temperatures whilst fearing for the health consequences of daring to open a window is more your style? Or maybe you just like to be woken by the delightful and unique screechings of the local pigeon turf wars? Is having incompetent and unfriendly staff a real turn on? If some or all of these enticing propositions form your Amsterdam accomadation checklist, and providing you have the relevent outdoor persuits qualifications necessary to scale the stairs, then the aptly-named Hotel Kabul your ideal Dutch experience.On arriving in Amsterdam we were turned away from our intended accomadation and instead were put up in the smaller less enticing surroundings of Hotel Kabul. However, the similarities with the nativity tale did not end there, as we were amazed to discover the range of wildlife that greeted us in the stable-like conditions of Kabul. Our view overlooking the courtyard of rotting Pigeon corpses was particularly striking, though the impression this left on us was perhaps less tangible than that left by the insects who relentlessly chewed their way through our party during our stay. We were especially perplexed by the dilema posed to us by the intense heat of our room. With the only window opening directly onto pigeon yard we were faced with a grim choice that ended in a combination of both foul smelling odours and heavy sweating as we attempted to strike an impossible balance.Whilst the pigeons revelled in their lively role of waking us at sunrise, the Hotel staff were somewhat less spirited and provided a sullen, dull, and unhelpful attitude that was entirely inkeeping with the general ambience of Kabul (city and hotel).The fact that i am not discussing at length the shortcomings of the decoration, the furnishings, security, the food, the stairs, the general hygene, and the toilet and shower facilities is reflective of the more concerning challenges provided during a stay at Hotel Kabul. Kabul is not a hotel to be taken lightly and guests should be aware of the battles that will await them upon arrival. Kabul by name, Kabul by nature, just don't bother...

<Content>Kabul is a no-go The other reviews are dead on- too bad I didn't read them before I booked! A friend and I popped over to Amsterdam from London for a weekend trip, and like the poor students that we are, we looked for somewhere cheap to stay. The Hostel Kabul seemed like a gamble when we booked online, but we didn't think it'd be such a flop house. Pay a little more and stay someplace a LOT nicer. Unless you like bad smells, dirty bathrooms, and an overall feeling of creepy filth. (One positive thing- the location is great for getting to Centraal Station)

<Content>Even Bin Laden wouldn't have stayed there for a minute!!! This is with no doubt the worse place I ever stayed in.. Dirty, Stinky, and expensive.. we paid 115 euro for a triple bedroom (if room is the exact word for this **** hole) actualy we were 20 if you count the mice and bugs.. no warm water and dirty sheets, no closets, just 2 matrasses where we slept with our clothes on so we won't catch cholera or ebola..Seriously, if someday this place is your only chance spending the night in Amsterdam, you better turn back home or go to Kabul in Afghanistan.. I'm sure you'll save yourself a lot of health..

<Content>Disgusting 8 of us where booked into a Hotel in Amsterdam. When we arrived only the 2 girls were accommodated. We were told that some works were going on in some rooms and there was not one for us. He took us approx 15 mins to another hotel. This one!! Bird poo inside the windows, pigeon problems, mice in the room. Came back with bites from something. Did not dare eat anything. Stairs were dangerous. Dirty toilet and showers. It is amazing that this hotel is allowed to rip people off and be open. What about health and safety and fire regulations. do they not exist in Amsterdam??

<Content>This place is a hazard I stayed there May 2004. The walls of the building were supported by metal make shift poles. The room was a disgrace with no toilet or bathroom eventhough we paid 100EU a night for a double bedroom.The view of the canal made the experience bareable but even that was ruined in the early hours of Sunday morning when a drugs addict from the next door room was screaming through the night and then jumped through the window. I guess I will remember my stay there forever for all the wrong reasons.

<Content>Not fit for Animals!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This place really is worse than spending a night on the streets, honest.... please spend your Euros elsewhere, the Hans Brinker Hostel for example is classy in comparison. Forget this Hostels location and the view from the canal facing rooms, you would be better staying miles away and looking out at a brick wall! This Hostel scares me, how do the owners manage to keep this place open? Horrible dirty rooms, never touched, sticky pattern carpet which was red now thick black. Windows only washed by rain (both sides). Pigeons!! Bunk beds are cheep old nasty metal affairs that are well past it, with thin soiled and knackered matresses. Roof leaks which caused water to run down the light fitting onto a bunk! I'm not writing anymore as I am trying to forget!!If this is the last place to stay in Amsterdam just don't... go to the 'VVV' at Central Station and book accomodation a bus or train ride away and try again the next morning. The Prins Hendrik is cheap, breakfast is fine, and will not ruin your trip to The Dam.

<Content>charm and alot of dirt if you want a real Dutch Amsterdam experience try reserving room #28 (or 29?) facing the canal. it is the best room they have. The disco from Bar 36 will keep you up all night, but for some strange reason there is something charming about this room. Ya they don't clean your room until you leave, you have to search for towels somewhere in the hotel. Cats come visiting and dissapear out windows, the toilet flushes onto your feet and you are standing in the shower. Still it has a great window to feed the birds your morning breakfast which consists of 2 stale pieces of bread, a nasty hardboiled egg and other meat slices I dare anyone to try. The seagulls love it, and obviously they know it's coming from the kabul. my girlfriend says never again, but I still loved it. I don't know why.

<Content>Once In A Life Time And Never Again! Arrived cold, wet , hungry and tired. The kubul was the last place in Amsterdam available, what can we say hell on earth, dirty, smelly, a cess pit. The receptionist looked like she had be embalmed. The cats looked like they had be dragged from the canal, The reason myself and my friends survived the whole sticken experience was due to our wonderful personalities.Our advice is to avoid the ****filled **** hole like the plague and spend your hard earned money on accom that is fit for human consumption.

<Content>Never again... If there was a '0' rating, this hole would have got it. And deservedly so. Only after we had booked for 3 nights in the place did it click that this place was called 'The Hotel Kabul'. I would put money on it that there are piles of brick in the Iraqi capital more pleasantly furnished than this slum. Apart from being very close to our most regular haunt (The Grasshopper), I don't really have any further positives to comment upon. The stairs are incredibly steep (not the easiest of challenges after 10 hours in the coffee shops) and our window was propped open with a rotting plank which we daren't remove through fear of structural collapse. This allowed swarms of mosquitos to freely enter the room and gorge on our polluted bloodstreams. They almost certainly had a better time than us, and at our expense. Note to self: Next time, sort the accomodation out well in advance and avoid places with names associated with current world conflicts.

<Content>stinks and has mice - health hazard I got a single room here, and regretted it. The room stank like a mixture of vomit and piss, wet patches on the carpet and walls. Made me feel sick just breathing there. I'm truly not a fussy person, and always thought I had a very weak sense of smell. The window wouldn't even open, so no escape from the smell. So tired I slept there for a couple of hours in the afternoon (with a cloth over my face). Woke up to find a mouse crawling over my leg. Asked for another room, none available, so asked for a refund. The receptionist laughed at me, saying I was scared of mice, she seemed unaware that they **** and piss all over, and can nibble on your belongings. Totally disgusting. They refused to give me a refund, saying that I should have said something earlier, maybe they should have a big sign saying that the Hotel Kabul is infested with vermin!

<Content>A dump in a great place. Well what can I say. I stayed there in march 2003. It smelled, the floor was dirty and it sloped. the staricase was a health hazard. HOWEVER the location is perfect! On your doorstep there are plenty of coffeeshops and bars. Another bonus is that it is really cheap and they give you breakfast ( although I didnt try eating as I was off my head). Overall its a great place just to crash and burn in Amsterdam!

<Content>Hell On Earth!!!!! Three days in what could only be described as 'Hell On Earth' was certainly a sheer test of ones indurance.Sharing beds with mites and listening to thumping 24hr disco music from the club underneath as well as tackling robbers who break into your room whilst you are asleep is pretty scary ----!!!!But cheap as hell.
