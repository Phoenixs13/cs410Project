<Content>Just OK First, the good news. The location is excellent. Within walking distance of many sites within the old city and a very short walk to the Liceu metro stop. Our room overlooked the square below and the view was great. The two different people operating the front desk while we stayed there were very helpful and spoke English. Next, the bad news. The walls are thin and we could hear the people in the next room adjacent to the head of our bed. Also, there was a waste water line also near the head of the bed. One could hear the water noisely rushing down as the toilets and showers above were used. The bathroom smelled like the waste lines were not vented correctly and the bath fan could not get rid of the smell. The room and the bath were small. The shower was tiny.The optional breakfast was good but expensive relative to what one could get in El Ravel, a short walk away.

<Content>Superb location This hotel is in a great location just off the Rambles within minutes walk of many sights and the Metro for visiting things further afield. It is just a short walk from Placa Catalunya too where you can catch the A1 airport bus for getting in an out of the city for a few Euros. Do be aware this is not a luxury hotel and you get what you pay for. The rooms are small and it can be quite noisy - especially as it is on a busy square with two cafes in the heart of the city and the walls of the rooms are thin. However I've been to Barcelona several times and have generally found most hotels to be pretty dire unless you pay big money - this being the best cheaper one I've found so far with the superb location being the best aspect. For other things to do, on weekends there are farmers and artists markets on the square. If you are fit and fancy a different way of seeing the city, hire bikes from the end of the Rambles (under the Columbus Statue). If you fancy posh tapas the Taller de Tapas restaurant on the same square is excellent. There are frequent spanish guitar concerts in the church on the square as well. For all other things the hotel reception staff are friendly and very helpful. Don't pay for breakfast, the cafes on the square are half the price. Overall an enjoyable stay. I will use this hotel again.

<Content>Good location but bad hotel Good location but buses, and most cabs,are not allowed in this area. Service was very poor. Our room was cleaned one day and not the next. The elevator, is installed only from the second floor up. There is also a bad odor that permeates this hotel.

<Content>Excellent Location This is the percfect place to stay for a short trip to Barcelona. It is a short distance off La Ramblas and at about the midway point of La Ramblas. Because it's tucked back a little ways you don't get all the noise from La Ramblas but it's only a few minutes walk away. You are close to the big market on La Ramblas and not far from the Bari Gothic area with the cathedral. You are also surrounded by many shops and restaurants. The hotel staff is very nice and helpful. The room was small but clean. My only complaint is the shower was the smallest I have ever seen! If you drop something you'll have to open the doors to be able to bend down and pick it up! I was worried my husband wasn't going to fit in the shower and he is a regular sized guy. He did fit but would hit the shower control when he turned around. If you can handle a small shower and won't be spending loads of time in your room this is a great budget hotel.

<Content>Good deal, EXCELLENT LOCATION!! Yes, it's a tiny room with a tiny bathroom. It's Europe, what do you expect for the money? This place is a good deal for Barcelona, especially for the location which is smack in the middle of it all in the Barri Gotic. Hubby and I are mid-aged travellers on a budget. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Day and eve staff speak English. Only drawback: the beds feel like box springs, very uncomfortable, rough sleeping. If you can handle that, I highly recommend to place. Skip the hotel breakfast  eat at the Boqueria or a nearby chocolate shop...good  cheap! Barcelona is at your fingertips from here. People who like to complain about everything should stay away!

<Content>Great location - clean, simple room I stayed here at this hotel in August. It was in a brilliant location - in the gothic quarter just off the main street las ramblas. It was reasonably prices, clean and simple. It is not glamorous and is simply a good basic hotel.

<Content>Little Gem in a big city Fab location for getting anywhere in Bacelona.We got the bus from the airport (4 euros), took us approx 10 mins to walk to the hotel from the bus.The little square its on is really cute, but be warned it's not quiet, but you are in the centre so I wouldn't expect any less. Markets etc start setting up at 9am ish, and the bells from the church next door start at 8am, so if you're a light sleeper take your earplugs.It really is a perfect location for discovering Barcelona, lots of coffee and pastry places nearby so you never get caught short.Service wasn't what I'm used to but I partly think its a culteral thing, I don't think they do it on purpose.Overall, very happy.

<Content>Great Location This hotel is located on a relatively quiet square just off the Ramblas. It is an awesome location to be close to all the action without having to sleep right on it. Depending on the staff members present the service can range from wonderful to below average. Be aware that if you ask for restaurant recommendations, they may recommend a place they get a commission from. The rooms are basic and clean. Not anything to complain about for the location and value. A few drawbacks were no computer for internet access (they do have free wi-fi in the lobby), and some staff were not particularly helpful.Just a few tips to hopefully enjoy your time in Barcelona better: Bus Turistic is a handy and convenient way of seeing all the sites in the city. The sites in Barcelona are a little more spread out than some other cities (ie Madrid). You can hop on/hop off at the major sites. The tickets for a one day pass are 23 euros and 26 for two days. You get a coupon booklet that almost pays for half of your ticket price to most major sites. There is a great tapas bar located really close to the hotel called Taverna Basca Irati. Also make sure to try Cafe de l'Academia for a nice dinner. It is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel just off of Placa S. Jaume. It was our favorite restaurant during our whole trip in Spain. Make sure to have reservations, otherwise you may not have much luck getting a table. About 13 euros per plate.

<Content>Cheap and cheerful Four of us stayed in this hotel in March. Brilliant location, just off the Ramblas. Yes it does have small rooms with small showers but generally speaking you don't spend long in the hotel room if you are only there for the weekend. Reception staff were helpful in every way and we had no problenms. We were so handy for all the places we wanted to go or closeto the transport system to take us there. The square outside our window had somethinggoing on most of the time, either an artists market or music in the evening. A few bars were also open.The fantastic market is five minutes away and if you walk through to the back and exit to the right there is a little cafe that does fabulous breakfasts for the same or similar prices to those in the hotel, much better than thos on the Ramblas. Please take care of your bags in Barcelona, we witnessed several pickpockets operating in the area close to Gaudis house and the chimney pot house, they work in teams so you don't get suspicious. Make sure you donot have your purses or wallets in your bag at your side always have it across your body at the front. One english couple had no idea they were being robbed until we shouted out.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at Hotel El Jardi in June 2008. The location was perfect! So close to everything. We stayed in an interior room. Small room, small bathroom but very clean. Weren't in room much so the lack of windows did not bother us. Definitely recommend for a budget option when you want something a little more than a backpackers.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff Super location. Lots of nearby tapas restaurants (Teller de Tapas was great, just 100 feet away). Close to the Barcelona market where we found a cheaper breakfast. Staff was very friendly and helpful. If the bill is more than 250 Euros, pay cash to get a 10 percent discount. We had an exterior room with a great view of the church. The room was small. But big deal.

<Content>Great Location! My fiance stayed at this hotel in June 2008 and we were amazed by how tiny the standard exterior room was that we stayed in. It was definitely clean and comfortable but you have to be able to tolerate small spaces. In our room the shower was tiny and I assume that the other rooms in the hotel have similar bathrooms. Would not recommend this hotel for a large person because I am 5'6 and 120 lbs and I had trouble in that shower. Staff was nice and helpful. Great location. Right off of La Rambla and close to a major metro hub and right in the middle of a shopping district.

<Content>Good location Hotel Jardi is in a great location in Barcelona. Just steps from the metro stop Liceu. Short walk to the Catedral and Barri Gotic. Helpful reception staff. Balcony overlooking square was great. Small rooms, small bathrooms and thin walls. Great for a short stay when not much time planned in room.

<Content>Good hotel, great location May 23-25, 2008We stayed at the Hotel Jardi for two nights. The location couldn't be beat. We had a balcony which overlooked the Placa Pi and we enjoyed being able to overlook the bustling square. I have to admit that the street cleaners coming in at night (usually around midnight) was a bit of a disturbance, but the idea of them cleaning at that hour was also surprising to me. It was, however, nice to know that we would walk out to a tidy area outside the next day.The hotel staff was very helpful and the best part was they could speak English very well. Our room was tidied up every day when we returned from sightseeing and, although a bit cramped, it was comfortable for what we needed, a place to relax and lay our head. To sum up, for the price and location I would highly recommend this place.

<Content>unhelpful staff While well located, our room was so small you could not open the door with your suitcase out. Bathroom equally small with tiny shower. Staff did not give accurate info (said no fountain show, not true) told us to eat at an expensive restaurant which was lousey. Needed to make calls after loosing credit cards and they said they didn't know how to place a collect call or reach an operator, so ended up with $200 in phone charges. I am pretty sure I remember giving them e40 for the safe key depost (can't prove it) and got e20 back. Asked for complaint book, they couldn't produce one. Walls were thin and could hear neighbors. Has an elevator once you go up a lot of steps.

<Content>small and basic in a good location very basic, army like feeling, interior rooms make you claustrofobic, because the 'window' is useless, no view is actually 'no air' or light either. Rooms walls need fresh paint, tv's just 8-10 channels and old. Most of all 'interior' room are kind of larger walk in closets. There is no table (or room for one) and only one chair.Beds (twins) are very narrow and space extremely limited. Bathrooms that do have bathtub are larger, but to close the shower door you need to be very slim. Bathrooms are indeed very clean, remodeled, but no window at all either and the fan is undersized.Most important, the fan starts when you turn on the light and does not stop when you turn it off, so if you use the bathroom at night you wake up your roommate and you don't get to go back to sleep either.If you decide to stay there, make sure you get an exterior room, but keep in mind the 1 1/2 flight of stairs you need to climb with your bags.

<Content>Expensive, noisy, and a little shower, but well situated. My wife and me were in Jardi for 3 nights. We were in 3 floor.Expensive, 106 Euros for a hostal!Noisy. You can hear people arrive and way out. We couldn't sleep very well.The bathroom is a joke. It was so small I couldn't wash my feet in the shower.The only good thing: Jardi is good situated, near subway and many interesting places (Las Ramblas, La Boqueria Market, gothic city, etc).

<Content>Price and Location can't be beat. Hotel Jardi in Barcelona has to be in one of the best locations in town. Located on Placa PI there was plenty to do just outside the door of the hotel and less then 2 blocks away was La Rambla and Metro stop Liceu . We had a room on the 3 floor with a balcony and the complaints about noise and size of room weren't an issue for us. We found the staff wasn't as cordial as we are use to but they spoke English and that was a help since our Spanish isn't to good.Didn't try breakfast because there are so many spots available to grab something nearby. For the price would stay there again but would pay the little extra to have a room on the 3rd floor with the extra space. Took a taxi to Sants train station for an early am departure and feel we were way overcharged, so a word of caution is to ask the price before you ride.

<Content>unfriendly front desk australian woman was there in april2008 for 4 nights.the area is nice,but its really noisy the whole night in the hotel.you can hear everything,like shower from other rooms,talking,screaming and so on.but the worst was the check out.i made my reservation with e-mail (3times),also made reconfirmation one week before arrival,all with the same price off 88 euro per room.but when i checked out this australian woman wanted to charge me 28 euros more.i had my printed mail with me so i showed her that i have arranged this 88 euros per night.she said ,that she is sure someone at the check in informed me that the roooms are more expensive now.but it was not.than she told me a lier and she was quite agressive and said afterwords there are enough hotels in barcelona,no one has to stay in this hotel.this was my bad experience in this hotel,i can no one recommend this hotel.i travel around a few times a year,but never heard staff talking like this.

<Content>Do NOT stay here If you don't mind staying in a hostel like atmosphere, but paying for a mid-range hotel, then this is your place. It is like a college dorm and has the sound-proofing of one as well. In the morning, we could hear those around us showering and laughing as they left (very early) to start their day.Some of the front desk people are very nice and helpful. However, our first night there my friend got mugged on a nearby street, someone came up behind her in a mask and snatched her purse out from under her arm. When we went back to the hotel to figure out next steps, they quickly said, yes that is a bad street. Things that would have been helpful BEFORE we walked around the area with our map. I'm amazed they don't give some specific warning rather than the general watch out for pickpocketsBarcelona was a beautiful city, but this obviously put a huge damper on it for us. The police there are a joke and do not care for Americans at all. I would stay somewhere else, unless you are on a tight budget and have big, heavy-set, intimidating people with you. If you are just traveling for fun, do yourself a favor for your safety and stay elsewhere please.

<Content>Agreat base for this wonderful city We have just returned from a great four day break in Barcelona 鈥?our first visit to the city. We booked everything rather last minute so my first three choices for hotels couldn鈥檛 take us. So, based on reviews on Trip Advisor and in a recent travel supplement review, we booked into the Hotel Jardi. In short, we got exactly what we had been led to expect from this hotel. The best thing about the hotel is its location and eternally pleasant staff. The hotel is on the lovely Plaza Sant Josef Oriol and although I would not agree with other reviewers who claim the location is quiet, it is not on a main road and it is probably a lot quieter than many other parts of the city. The plaza was charming with plenty options for breakfast within a stone鈥檚 throw of base. The hotel offers good value (we paid just less than 拢300 for four nights in an external larger double room with a balcony). Now, don鈥檛 expect to have space to practice your salsa in these 鈥榣arge鈥?rooms and the balcony is crowded with two people standing on it, but the location is great, the views are lovely and there is a nice 鈥榝eel鈥?about the place. In short we would stay there again, especially since you don鈥檛 actually spend a lot of time in your hotel on these weekend breaks.I would probably suggest that you don鈥檛 have breakfast at the hotel 鈥?why would you with so many wonderful options within a five minute walk. Yes, the little square is lovely but why not walk five minutes to the Boqueria Market just across the Ramblas from the hotel and dine like a king with the locals? We had the most amazing wild mushrooms, served up with asparagus and a little fresh pesto, on homemade bread. Or head out the back, right-hand door of the market and have the best Spanish breakfast in town on the sunny terrace of 鈥楻a鈥?

<Content>Perfect Location! My husband and I spent our New Year's week in Barcelona and stayed in Hotel Jardi. Like the prior reviews here, it was kind of tough getting there because the cab driver dropped us off at La Rambla and although it was relatively close to the hotel, it was a pain because we had several luggages. Then, here comes the stairs ...and it was not fun, especially if you're lugging off several pieces of luggages!!! Nobody was there to help you either!PROS - The major asset of this hotel is its location. We had a room with balcony facing the courtyard and it was worth paying the extra 6 euros per night to get this room. We watched the hustle and bustle of activities going on at Plaza del Pi from our balcony. It's close proximity to La Rambla and to the Liceu Metro Station is a BIG PLUS. We walk up and down La Rambla, from the Colon statue to Plaza Catalunya. La Boqueria Market is about 5 minutes from the hotel as well. There is also a huge supermarket along La Rambla that have very reasonable prices. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They offer breakfast on site though we never ate there as there are several other places to eat nearby. The cleaning staff cleaned our room on a daily basis.CONS - Our room was VERY spartan. We have the standard double room, and having just stayed in a timeshare facility in Italy prior to coming here....we wanted to turn around and move to a different hotel. The bathroom was very small, especially the shower. My husband feels claustrophobic everytime he takes a shower. For the price that we paid for this hotel, especially since its during the holidays...I could say that it's worth it. I might come back again if I don't see anything that's as good of a location that'll cost the same. However, I will probably search around first.

<Content>great location This hotel is located down a couple of winding narrow streets off the main thoroughfare, La Ramblas. It faces a lovely little square with restaurants, gelato, and a wonderful old church. We had a very small room on the 8th floor - there is a lift - but it had an amazing terrace with wonderful views over the rooftops. We often sat there at dusk, drinking champagne and snacking on yummy titbits we had bought at the markets which were just off the other side of La Ramblas. The bathroom was comparatively large and very clean. The location was also quite near the main Catalunya Square which we reached by walking through mainly pedestrianised streets with great shops. The hotel desk people spoke English and were very helpful.

<Content>The best location A small hotel in a great location. It is just off La Rambla overlooks two plazas near a large old cathedral. An incedible atmosphere. A great base for exploring all the narrow streets in the older part of Barcelona. Metro station 200 m away.The rooms were clean, of good size and recently updated. The reception staff spoke good English (we didnt know any Spanish).I have no hesitancy in recommending it.

<Content>Up the stairs you go... Hotel JardiPros: Central, very close to La Rambla and Placa d'Angel. Very convenient. Relatively cheap. Metro is very close (on La Rambla). Hairdryer and room safe available.Cons: Have to lug bags up a flight of stairs to reception (1st floor) then up 2nd flight of stairs to lift. Most taxis will not drive up to the doorstep, usually drop you off on La Ramble but it's only a short walk. Walls very thin, luck of the draw who's banging around in the stairway or talking in the room next door. Shower cubicle very narrow (double room) but ok in single room. Will only take credit card payments if spend 250 euros (not even 249 euros). Overall: If you're willing to put up with the negatives, it's convenient to stay in this hotel.

<Content>No Frills Comfort This hotel is on a plaza about a block off Las Ramblas. Our room was small, spare and sufficiently comfortable and clean but not terribly attractive. The best feature was the huge balcony and double glass doors. We were on the top floor so we also had a view across the rooftops and were able to see fireworks one night. Our room was very near the belltower next door so the bells were LOUD! They were humorously loud enough to add to the charm of the place for us. We could have closed the doors, but why not experience it all? The staff was a changing cast of people who looked like students and may not have had a lot of insider info, but were eager and helpful. We didn't try the breakfast in the little plain room off the lobby as there were nice places nearby with good food and more charm. We agree with the preceding writer that there are many, many stairs before you reach the elevator. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great value Very clean, great location, very near La Rambla in the old city.In a few minutes, can walk to most of the old city sites. The plazathat this hotel is on has coffee shop, gelato, artists and a food market. It's not a luxury property but we only paid 98 E per night.One caution: the hotel is about 2 flights up from the street beforethe elevator. If you have alot of luggage (we did) be prepared for some exercise. (no one helps) Also, the elevator is tiny: 2 feet by 4 feet! All in all, a great value with reasonable expectations.Also, private bath was fine and spotless.

<Content>Great Location! Barcelona is a beautiful city and I really appreciated the great location of Hotel El Jardi. On a quaint little square, very quiet and clean, with a multilingual staff who were very helpful. We stayed in a small double interior room to save some money but if you want a larger room, I highly recommend the exterior rooms with a balcony. Breakfast is 6 euros and consists of pastry, coffee, and orange juice. Honestly we just ate at the ice cream/cafe next door on the corner and got the same breakfast for 2-3 euros. The Boqueria (market) is very close and it is also fun to eat in there for a more reasonably priced breakfast. I would definitely stay at El Jardi again.

<Content>Hotel Jardi: excellent, quaint, affordable We spent four nights in Barcelona recently and stayed at the Hotel Jardi on Plaza Sant Josef Oriol. It was easy to find, affordable at 鈧?8/night, secure, clean, the rooms were basic but very pleasant. The staff were multi-lingual and extremely eager to help. We made our arrangements via email and the business process was efficient and straightforward. They provided a detailed map with directions on how to find them.The hotel is located on a beautiful, quaint, and bustling plaza that has a constant stream of good looking people walking through. It's a quick three minute walk to the Ramblas. There are a couple cafe's or bars on the plaza so people are sitting and enjoying themselves. When we were there, there was a food bizarre right around the corner, and an art show directly in front of the hotel. We had a balcony overlooking the plaza so we could just sit out there and be part of the action and the room was very quiet with the doors closed for when we wanted some peace and quite.If we get back to Barcelona, this is the place we'd stay!

<Content>Skip this place - not worth the money Okay - I guess you should expect less from a pensione - but for almost $100 us a night - this place sucked. It was really small and very dorm-like. Just offered the basics - very old. I do have to say it is in a great location - but the reception people smoked in there everyday - it killed me bc there was no ventilation. Save your money and stay somewhere else - dont be fooled by the nice website either - this place is a dive.

<Content>Good location, tiny rooms Stayed here for three nights in mid-September. The location was great: right on two quaint squares, a few minutes from the Ramblas and within easy walking distance of the port, the Cathedral and Placa Catalunya. Our only complaint was the room size: it was literally so small it pretty much fit just the bed. (There was chair in there when we arrived and we had to bring it downstairs in order to have a place for our suitcases.) The bathroom was also ridiculously small: you couldn't bend over in the shower. However, we felt like we got a good deal for our money considering the prime location. Note: if you're taking a taxi from the airport make sure to tell them the hotel is on Placa Sant Josep, not just Sant Josep as in the street. We didn't make this clear and ended up 3/4 of a mile away being dropped off on the side of the street while the cab driver made some gestures with his arms and then drove away. Apparently the street Sant Josep is under construction and not open to cars.

<Author>happy_travels_2all
<Content>enjoyed the jardi We stayed in a corner room that had 2 windows overlooking a small square. it was conveniently located, just a couple of blocks off the chaotic and busy ramblas. it's only a couple of minutes to walk to the ramblas (mid-ramblas), 5 minutes to the cathedral, less than 10 minutes to placa de catalunya, maybe 30 minutes to casa mila/la pedrera. taking a taxi from parc guell cost about 8 or 9 euros.the room was a good size - it didn't feel small or cramped with 3 single beds. the bathroom was a bit tight, but not unexpected. both the room and bathroom were very clean. although the windows weren't double-paned, we have no complaints about the room being noisy. the only time we really heard anything was when a street performer did his thing in the square right outside the window. we found we had great seats for his mediocre show. the hotel staff was pleasant enough, allowing us to store our luggage in the breakfast room both before and after our stay, and called a taxi to take us to the airport (25eur) we didn't eat breakfast, so can't comment on that. overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would recommend it without hesitation.

<Content>Great location Hotel Jardi is in a great location off La Ramblas. It faces two very nice squares. The area felt very safe at night and the staff were very nice  helpful. We stayed in a standard exterior room so it had its own balcony overlooking one of the squares. The room and bathroom were tiny though, you could barely move in the bathroom and there was little room for luggage. They do have larger rooms though. Breakfast is available for an additional fee.

<Content>Nice location but average hotel We stayed here for a week at the end of April. We had a room overlooking the square which was pleasant, but the balcony is not what I'd call a balcony, just a large window. The room itself was tiny as was the bathroom, on the plus side it was clean. Very uncomfortable bed and noisy room - poor sound-conditioning. All in all we had a great holiday but sleeping in our own home again came as a great relief! I would not recommend this hotel... I didn't think it was value for money, I know Barcelona is expensive but I am sure you could do better.

<Content>Perfect Location We loved those hotel. Had a room with a balcony, overlooking a courtyard, the room was small but sufficient. Bathroom was also small, but very clean and looked like newly renovated.We also stayed in an interior room one night which had a much bigger bathroom.Very well located, a short walk to many attractions, metro, surronded by places to eat and great shopping.It is also a 5-10 min walk from where the airport bus drops off and picks up.Would definately stay here again, great value for money.

<Content>Simple, Clean, and Great Location on a Cute Square This hotel was a little hard to find from the Metro stop at Liceau, but is SO close to La Ramblas, great shopping, transportation, and sights. It was a pretty small room, and even smaller bathroom. But, it was completely clean, and the staff were very helpful and nice. You cannot beat the price for the location. It's on a very cute little square with a market that opens during the day. There are tons of places to eat breakfast, and the quintessential Churros con Chocolate cafe is just around the corner! All in all, this was perfectly located, at a great price!

<Content>Good value I was part of a group of travellers in April who stayed in Hotel Jardi. I stayed in two different rooms- a standard room with two beds on the top floor, facing the hotel's interior. I then switched rooms (due to the group arrangement- not because of the room) and stayed in a triple facing the exterior courtyard/ally. I preferred the first room, despite its odd shape (shaped sort of like a slice of pie?) as it was much quieter and had a larger bathroom. I found the staff to be extremely friendly, mostly non-Spanish residents and the location was perfect. I was not expecting a 5 star hotel with the low price paid, and thus was content with the product I received. I only wish that there were an elevator that went to the bottom floor, so that I did not have to drag my luggage to the lobby.

<Content>Good location but very basic facilities We stayed in Hotel Jardi for 3 nights in May 07. Its location is excellent but the facilities are very basic. Very small water flow for shower, it's very noisy if someone speaks in the corridor / comes back late at night next door (given that I live in a very noisy city, usually I can put up with a bit of noise at night but this time it was quite noisy and woke me up at night). I would say it's not really a hotel but more like a BB or youth hostel, if you are looking for a budget stay then it's acceptable.

<Content>Hotel Jardi was pefect for our visit! My husband and I had an excellent stay at Hotel Jardi. We had room 43 on the fourth floor with a balcony and view of the church and courtyard area below. A good deal at 98 Euros per night, particularly for the location!The room was clean, clean, clean! Not a scuff on the white walls anywhere. The bathroom was sparkling and very large by European standards. Great water pressure, too.In reading other negative reviews, I feel like we stayed at another hotel! Maybe it's best to stick to rooms on the upper floors? Our room was actually a triple, but there were just two of us in a double bed. When I booked the room originally, they didn't have a room with a double bed and exterior view available. So, I booked an exterior view room with two twin beds. However, about a week after I booked, they called and said they had a better room available and did I want it, which I thought was great customer service! Front desk staff was very nice, and the location is just fantastic. We took the metro very little as so much was within walking distance!

<Content>Just OK We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during our trip around Spain. I have to admit that even tough the location of the hotel is excellent, the hotel was not good at all. I had asked for a room with a balcony and a view. They gave us a room in the first floor behind the kitchen overlooking a small plaza. The view was great but we felt the noise from the kitchen and the flushing of toilets all night long. The room also has a strange smell. Since it was on the first floor we could not leave the balcony door open at night for security reasons so we had to use the A/C which was old and noisy. We asked the front desk for a room change but they were not nice at all at the point to not even consider switching us. I had made the reservations with 2-3 months in advance but they did not care. The bathroom was small and the shower door broke. The bed and towels were also bad quality. I would never stay in this hotel again. If this is the only one around for your budget, make sure to ask for a room in the top floors and with a view to the plaza but consider a different hotel first.

<Content>good value, great location The Hotel Jardi is very basic but clean and very well located. All of our email correspondence making reservations and getting directions from them was very easy. All of the desk clerks speak fluent English. The location, off Las Ramblas is good and the hotel is right on a lovely little square not far from the Cathedral. There are no bell hops and even though there is a small elevator you still have to get the luggage up to the reception level which is a long flight of stairs. Our room had a small balcony overlooking the square. This is a no frills place but well run and clean. Not for older travellers I would say, the elevator sometimes does not run well and it has 5 floors of rooms. Note: you have to pay in cash unless your room bill is over 250 euros.

<Content>Small and unpretentious We have stayed here for the past few years, always around the 24th September for the Fiesta.It's a small hotel and not at all fancy but it's always clean and the service is good.There are disadvantages : the lift begins at the 1st floor, the showers can be tiny even when the bathroom is large, inside rooms are not attractive and it's important that your room has a window and also a balcony. Disadvantages are far outweighed by the good points : the location is unbeatable if you want to be in the heart of the old quarter; even though the hotel is on two lively squares we were never disturbed by noise: the staff are friendly and helpful and all speak excellent English; breakfast is adequate and not expensive. Prices in 2006 were the same as those in 2005.

<Content>Noisy during the day but quaint I agree with everything I read about this hotel on Trip Advisor - the rooms can be very small and very noisy during the day. However, the street musicians and the sidewalk cafes generally all close up about 9 p.m. so no problem sleeping. It is a quaint square but our room could have done with a paint job and the shower was incredibly small. That being said, the location is very good for sightseeing. I'd go again but would make sure to get one of the largest rooms on the top floors.

<Content>Jardi deserves all the praise we had heard. On Trip Advisor and other sites we had read good things about Hotel Jardi. We also have friends who recommended we stay there, knowing we would enjoy the neighborhood. It is a lower priced hotel with no frills, but everything we wanted in a room, and more. We had a balcony and another set of double windows opening on a square (which was a delightful place in which to have a meal, a coffee, or a glass of wine). The rooms are clean, the staff friendly and helpful. We would happily return.

<Content>Perfect for per-cruise We are travelers who like to go off the beaten path to get the feel the place we are visiting. We are very active aged 58 and 60, and this was for a stay before a 12 day cruise so we had LUGGAGE--a large rolling case (48.5lbs), a rolling garment bag(35lbs), a small rolling case (32lbs) and a backpack.With all this we took the airport bus and easily rolled our luggage to the hotel, if you take the time to study maps before you leave home the square and hotel are easy to find. Yes, there is a steep flight of stairs to carry your stuff up, but if we can do it--so can the younger and sturdier crowd.We arrived at the hotel at 9am and were pleasantly greeted, we left our luggage in the back of the breakfast room, took care of check-in and were told that our room would be ready by about 11am. The area is perfect for exploring.We had a small room on the top floor with a terrace. It was perfect!!! The terrace was huge, with comfortable chairs and a full table, overlooking the church and in the top of the trees of the placa.By some inventive rearranging (we moved the bed against the wall and used the luggage as a headboard we were able to completely open the french doors which made the tiny room seem bigger.The room was very clean, the shower in the bathrrom great and the terrace devine. The people at the desk were very friendly and helpful. I saw them advice other tourists about securing their belongings while in town, they did everything possible to be sure that you had a wonderful visit to this wonderful city.As stated in previuos reviews the location is wonderful, just up the walkway from the hotel are little cafes for coffee and CHOCOLATE in the morning. You are close enough to La Rambles to wander over for the excitement, but then you can escape to your own little hideaway in the Barri Gothic.The hotel called a taxi to take us to thge port--it came right to the door of the hotel.If you are looking for an American hotel--this is not it. If you want a European experience at a great price--the Jardi is for you.

<Content>Charm in Plaza/Not in hotel After reading all the glowing reviews of this hotel, I was disappointed in all but the location. We walked around looking for the front door before realizing that it WAS the front door. Through the glass door we could see a sterile vestibule with a straight staircase and garbage cans. There was no lift so we carried our luggage up the narrow stairs to the reception counter. During our 5 night stay we encountered only one staff person who was knowledgeable. The rest were either newcomers themselves or uncommunicative, and the night man didn't speak English. If your room wasn't ready you had to leave your luggage by the vending machine, along with everyone else's, using the honor system. The other hotels where we stayed had a separate secure room for luggage, which they tagged with our room #'s. Our exterior superior room with balcony was large, plain, and so-so clean with a lone photo of a submarine over the bed. How's that for sexy?We tried the breakfast one morning when we had to leave early and never repeated it. Pricey for bread and spongey croissants.That said, the location was great. The plaza below our balcony had a life of its own and was ringed with small, interesting shops of all sorts. We soon had our favorite pastry shop and coffee shop for the morning. The plaza was always filled with activity (art show, wedding) and mellowed down late at night. The Basilica de Santa Maria del Pi was also right there with nightly music concerts, which we could decide on as we walked to our hotel. Las Ramblas and underground stops very closeby.

<Content>Buzzy square yet quiet after midnight. I have been to barcelona SO many times!I stayed at this hotel in June 05 and then took back my 5 yr old daughter and my mum for a week in Sept. I love the location of this hotel, there are a couple of lovely cafes on the ground floor which are great for waiting in. it is vey lively area but in no way hectic. The hotel is in the Gothic area and some cabs take a while to get to it, almost easier to walk from the ramblas if you know exactly where you are going. Of a weekend there is a market in the squares too. The hotel is friendly, communicated via email and gave me a cash rate on the room which was 15% less. the room was very clean and I would advise you ask for a room with a balcony overlooking the square. We all really enjoyed our stay there and felt safe. Book in advance for a good room.

<Content>A View with a Bed We spent a weekend at the Jardi and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel is in a terrific location in the heart of old Barcelona and at the juncture of two lovely plazas. Our room looked out on one of these plazas. Only the room was quite small, just enough for two people to move around, hence my husband named it a view with a bed. The bathroom was quite large and clean, and the service is friendly and courteous.We enjoyed wandering through the streets to vist churches, museums, and other remarkable forms of archiecture. We had lived in Barcelona before, when I had a visiting professorship at the University, but then lived out of town, and never got to see the Barrio Gotico the way we did this time. I recommend the Jardi for couples who are looking for this type of hands on adventurer rather than the lluxury of a big American-style hotel.

<Content>A Disappointment We were looking forward to Barcelona and the El Jardi. After all, the woman at the other end of the email exchanges was so helpful and accomodating. But...this hotel disappoints. It's got a good location, just off Las Ramblas and looks like it might be old and quaint from the outside, but once up the flight of stairs into what passes for a lobby (feels more like the admittance desk at your local emergency room) and one begins to get the picture. It's a very basic hotel, sterile, functional and just not very comfortable. Not so nice to come home to after a day of sightseeing. The discerning traveler will want to do better.

<Content>Fantastic - provided ... My son and I recently spent a couple of days at the Jardi - it was just beautiful. However, there are a couple of things to be aware of.The hotel is virtually a pension. It is spotlessly clean and the staff (in particular the beautiful receptionist), are terrific. We had asked for an external room, but this was not available on the first night. The internal room was clean, but small and definitely nothing to write home about. The external room we had on the second night was lovely. It overlooked the beautiful square and we could look down on the umbrellas and the art display on show on the weekend. The basilica in the square was beautiful and we went to a live performance by a well known Spanish guitarist on the Sunday night. The atmosphere was priceless. I would love to stay again, but only if I had an external room.

<Content>Loved it!! My husband and I spent 8 nights at the Hotel Jardi, and were ready to become long-term residents by the end of the stay! The hotel was wonderful, the staff extremely pleasant and helpful. We had an 8th floor balcony room overlooking the placa. Very quiet, except for the cathedral bells and the occasional accordian player below. I was struck! So convenient to everything needed for a top notch stay in Barcelona. I will stay here again on my next trip to Barcelona, no questions asked!

<Content>Hotel Jardi We just spent 1 night in the hotel Jardi on Nov. 10, 2005. The hotel was very clean but very very small. The location to La Rambla was terrific, a 2 minute walk. Our room was on the 5th floor across from the elevator. This was no problem as it was off season and very quiet. I would imagine that during the In season it would be not the greatest room to have because of the additional noise from the elevator. We had a small double bed. After we got our 3 suitcases in there was hardly any room to move around. We had a bath with a shower. There was no hairdryer. (I bring my own always) However, they would rent you one for 10E. There was a safe in the teeny closet which also had a fee. There were french doors that opened onto a small square that included a church. Not really any cars. However, the noise that came up from this square ALL night long kept us up most of the night. It was just awful. To get to the lobby of the hotel you have to climb up 24 stairs and carrying 2 carryons and 1 large suitcase was quite the hassle after our cab let us off on La Rambla. We had to walk to the hotel which was only like one block. This was no problem. But the stairs were. Then after checking in, you had to walk up 6/7 more stairs to the tiny elevator. (I am thinking that most elevators in Europe are tiny) There was room for 1 person and 2 carryons/or just two people and no luggage. We had breakfast in the morning at the hotel. Toast, croissant, jam, orange juice(not fresh) and a cup of coffee each. It was 5.50E/person. Since we wanted to do a few minutes of shopping this was the best bet and it was pretty decent. The people in the lobby were very very helpful and friendly. They called a cab for us in the morning and it came right to the door! We were surprised since the night before the driver left us off on La Ramble. Again taking the suitcases down those stairs was a hassle. Would I stay there again, Yes but unless I had a bigger room, only for one night. Ours was a Standard Exterior room for 86E/night NOT including breakfast.

<Content>Hotel Jardi, a wonderful hotel for the physically fit! We just got back from staying at the Hotel Jardi for 3 days prior to a cruise and 2 day after a cruise leaving out of Barcelona. I have to say Hotel Jardi is a fabulous hotel! It is situated between two placa's (plaza's) and across one of the placa's is a beautiful gothic church. The atmoshere around this hotel is the best you are going to get for complete emersion into old Barcelona. There is no cars to be seen, just people strolling through the placa's, or riding on their bicyles. You are so centrally located it is amazing! This is the third oldest hotel in Barcelona so you have to take it's age in account when you deal with getting there. The rooms are newly remodeled and very modern and clean. The furniture is all IKEA In other words small, to fit in rooms that arn't super large. But the bed was comfy and large. If you book this hotel I would never tell you to get anything but a superior outside room. That way you are assured to get a balcony with double french doors that open out to the wonderful placa's. You can sit outside and listen to the music and the people below, not to mention the chiming of the bell tower from the church. All so very charming and wonderful! Now to the small issues. These things must be weighed against the many positve things Jardi has to offer. First, like I said there is no cars near the hotel which makes for a wonderful auto noise free stay. But it also means your taxi can't drive you to the front door. You have to be dropped off about a block away at the Las Rambles and hoof it to the hotel. Which with lots of luggage can be quite a challenge. If you travel light you will have no problems. Also when you get to the hotel there is just an entry way on the ground floor. You have to carry your own bags up one very large flight of narrow stairs and then one small flight to get to the front desk. Where you will find a very helpful desk person who speaks several languages. Once you are checked in then it's two medium flights to the elevator which can only take one person with luggage at a time. It's too small for anything more. Also there is no one to help you with your bags at any time so don't expect it. If you are older, not fit, or have any physical limitations I would not book this hotel for these reasons. Now having said that-I would stay at Jardi again in a heartbeat! It is one of the most charming and fabulous hotels I have ever stayed in! And I travel ALOT!

<Content>Clean, safe, no frills in a great location After a week in the 4-star Palacio San Martin (for only a few euros more than the Jardi charged) in Madrid, the Jardi came as a bit of a shock on arrival. But we soon made peace with its no frills style and lack of amenities because of the superb location. The hotel is clean and safe and the staff was courteous and as helpful as might be expected, although they seemed surprised when we asked for another of the very tiny bars of soap after two days. And forget trying to get so much as a cup of coffee before 8:30 in the morning, when the modest continental breakfast service begins. Also, we were offered a 10% discount for settling our bill in cash, but when we checked out, the night clerk on duty pleaded for credit card payment and said he'd get in trouble if he accepted cash. The Jardi's location is perfect; the two squares are all charm and entertainment. But if you opt for a front room (they're the larger ones and none too big at that,) be prepared to stay awake until the outdoor cafes and street entertainers concluded their evening's business.

<Content>Ahh....... We loved Jardi and Barcelona!!! My 15 year old daughter and I spent 4 nights at Hotel Jardi in Barcelona the first week in June. If we are lucky enough to return to this fabulous city, we WILL stay at Jardi again. The gothic quarter is where the life of the city exists... we felt like we were living in medieval Spain. It is gorgeous. There are cafes and shops everywhere. The beauty of the buildings and churches is breathtaking. Placas (big open plazas) are all over town. We loved this area more than any other, and we toured the whole city.I'll ask for the same room! We had room 34. HUGE! Two balconies and a window. A/C felt really nice on some of the warm days. Very clean, well serviced. One bed was a little on the firm side ( daughter got that one); my bed was decent. The view and the location could not be beat. Walls are thin, however. Light sleepers may have a problem. Windows are double-paned though, blocking most of the outside noise. Staff was beyond friendly. All our needs were met.For you early risers, there is a little cafe/bar just up from Jardi (on the same side of the walkway) that does open early(ish) and has GREAT coffee and good breakfast deals. Best coffee we had anywhere! (We always ordered cafe con leche... it's espresso with steamed milk in it.) Two restaurants you cannot miss for great dining and outstanding value: (forgive my spelling) Les Quinze Nits in Placa Reail and La Fonda just behind the placa... turn right and walk about a half block. It's on the left on Escudellers. Both of these are fine restaurants with several courses available. We had dinners with wine, appetizers, salads, entrees, and dessert and coffee for 26-29 Euros! Line up at least 30 min. early for Les Quinze Nits. They both open at 8:30.Hope you have as great a time as we did!!E-mail if you have any questions. Lisa

<Content>Awesome hotel and Location What a fantastic place to stay. Found it in LP guide and was lucky enough to get room with two balconies. Room was very clean, serviced daily, very comfortable. Great locations with cafes and shopping, not to mention La Rambla near by. Well worth the money! We'll be back for sure. From NZ traveller.

<Content>Ruined my visit to Barcelona This hotel had been recommended to me by a friend in the U.K. I booked well in advance (l month)for three people. The booking (they do it by hand, not computer) had been messed up, and I was told that they could accomodate us for the first two nights but then we would have to move to another hotel. I told them we did not want to move, and the woman (I later found out was one of the owners) was very rude in telling us there was no option but to move. Now, I can understand a mistake was made, but I did not make it. No apology was given and being confronted with hostility after a long journey is not pleasant. We were accomodated adequately for the first two nights (no complaints), and finally they found a way to squeeze us into an interior room. If you have ever stayed at the Jardi, you know the interior rooms are tiny and have nothing more than camp beds. The shower did work properly, the toilet seat was broken, and we got an unasked for wake-up call at 3:00 a.m.! The interior rooms have large uncurtained windows which pour light in all night, as well! We were happy to leave! For those who think this is an inexpensive hotel--Room + breakfast in the exterior room was 103 euros. We stayed in a comparable hotel in Paris (in view of the Eiffel Tower) for 120 euros. The experiences were like night and day. For 17 euros, we got a wonderful room and great service. I would not stay at the El Jardi again.

<Content>Excellent Staff Hotel Jardi is in the charming Placa de Pi, actually two lively, but smallish squares. You could find everything you need to have a wonderful time in Barcelona within sight of the front door. Our room, on the top floor, had a fantastic view of the largest rose window in Europe, so they say. The room was smallish but spotless. The elevator starts on the first floor, not the ground floor. I would avoid Semana Santa and Spring Break next time. The crowds are huge and prices are jacked up a bit. But I would definitely return to this charming hotel with it's excellent staff.

<Content>Exactly what we wanted... I stayed in the Jardi recently and was very pleasantly surprised. No, it is not a 5* hotel or anything like it. Inside is clean, pleasant but basic. Tiny elevators bring you to your floor - we were on the top floor, which was the 8th floor... which was super as we had a terrace with a table and chairs overlooking Placa del Pi (as opposed to just a balcony on the other floors). The location is superb - near the Ramblas, in the old gothic quarter, overlooking 2 quaint squares, beside an old church. We paid 96 euros a room which is just 拢65 so no complaints!

<Content>Nice Hotel - Great Location we stayed at this hotel for four nights  we liked it. The rooms were basic but very clean  everything worked OK. I asked for a room with a view over one of the squares  we were given a room with two windows had a view of both of them. The staff were very helpful  friendly  everyone who was around during the day spoke English. I would definitely return although I would ensure that I had one of the outer rooms. We didn't have any problem with noise as was reported in some reviews.

<Content>Dissappointed by Hotel Jardi The Hotel Jardi was recommended to me by a friend and I was very dissappointed. The first reservation was taken over the phone with a credit card. When I arrived in Barcelona I was told that the desk clerk had made a mistake and we could only stay one nite, of three reserved.They then tried to send us to this incredibly horrible place a few blocks away. I made other arrangements and continued a tour of Spain. A few weeks later I gave the Jardi another chance calling from Ibiza and making reservations, this time for two nites. Having the last visit fresh in my memory, I proceeded to call the Jardi two additional times, once to make certain they had my reservation, next to tell them the ferry would be late from Ibiza but we still wanted the room. I could not believe it when we arrived and the desk clerk said they were are filled up and the morning guy had overbooked..I was angry and said I was going to an internet cafe to begin writing this review. While at the desk another weary traveler arrived with a reservation, without a room also.I will never return to this hotel again. I do recommend the Bar del Pi downstairs. Great tapas! But alas the Hotel Jardi has some major problems and I would not reccomend it to anyone.

<Content>Great Location Above average for the price. Great location, clean, attractive. Rooms with balconies can be on one of two plazas. One of these (on the west side of the building) has an outdoor market on Sundays but they take it down late Sunday night so it can be noisy then. Also, our room had quite thin walls between rooms so it pays to go to bed late. But we'd still go back.

<Content>Watching the world go by FINDING the hotel that first night was not easy, but once I arrived the location could not be beat. About a block off the Rambalas, about 2 blocks from the Cathedral, and I could look out over the placa and a beautiful old church from the tiny balcony of my room.I would advise asking for an outside room, but what you get for what you pay was impressive.

<Content>I would not go back to Hotel Jardi The one thing that hotel Jardi has going for it is it's location. It is a basic hotel that is luckily for it in a nice part of the town. We found that their customer service was quite poor and they were pretty unhelpful when they made a mistake on the type of room we had booked even though they were happy enough to admit it was their mistake. The rooms with a view and two single beds are absolutely tiny and cell like and quite depressing. I would advise spending slightly more and getting a room with a balcony or with 3 beds in it. Although we didn't have any trouble from noise outside we did suffer from noise inside the hotel as you can hear everything and it was a case of being woken up very early each day. I thought that hotel Jardi was ok, I wouldn't reccomend it to any of my friends and i wouldn't stay their on my next visit to Barcelona.

<Content>Great Find for a Great Price Hotel Jardi gave me the most bang for my buck, so to speak. Most of the hotels I checked out were charging almost twice than I paid for in Hotel Jardi. The hotel is fabulously situated in the center of the Ramblas district and has clean and nice rooms. The staff is nice and can speak in English. The hotel itself is clean and located in a safe area. The downside is the noise from the plaza that you can hear in the middle of the night. Just close your windows and crank up the AC. For anyone who is looking for a great value at a great price in a great location, Hotel Jardi is the one. I will definitely come back...

<Author>Belfast-Buzzer
<Content>Excellent location but get the right room! I have given the Hotel Jardi 4 pips out of 5 here because one has to bear in mind this is a budget hotel where the bill isn't difficult to pay. It is sitting in a prime location overlooking two plazas in the Barri Gotic, a few steps away from La Rambla and not far away from Plaza Catalunya and other such great plazas with all that goes on there. (And don't miss La Boqueria market off La Rambla - a sight to behold). Underneath our balcony was the Bar del Pi, reckoned to be one of the best bars in Barcelona. Next to that is one of the best tapas places in the City. In the plaza below us they held a market of crafts and home-made produce like local honey flavoured with orange flowers or chestnuts. Anywhere you go within a few steps you will find something of interest including a Catalan restaurant. Contrary to the advice I have read here about getting an interior room to avoid noise, you must ask for a room with a balcony. This way you have the view over the plazas and the life of Barcelona (and the 'French' windows, I think, are double glazed anyway). I was there off-season, admittedly, but I would choose to have the room with the view. It's a simple place and the price charged reflects that. The beds were extremely comfortable and the en suite bathroom was great. Cleanliness? Haven't seen cleaner. And there's a safe in the room for passports. Downside - not good for disabled people - there's a tough flight of stairs to negotiate to reception and a few steps more to the lift. Luckily a young man was around to help with heavy suitcases. Day staff speak English but night people don't. My own Castillian Spanish was lost there too. And breakfast is late, so our early plane meant breakfast in the airport. But this isn't a bed and breakfast, anyway. You have to book and pay for breakfast. Easy thing is to go out on the street where all things are happening, including breakfast. And the tapas around there are to die for. I recommend Hotel Jardi as a place to hang your hat. It's in a perfect situation for you to discover everything that surrounds it. But remember to do what the locals do - don't carry a handbag. You're so safe when your arms are free. Despite that warning, Barcelona is marvellous and the Hotel Jardi is in the right place. Within a few steps of the hotel my friend and I were having a ball. It's an ultra-clean, plain place to sleep but has balconies overlooking Barcelona life - get one of those rooms. As budget hotels go, what more could one ask for?

<Content>not what we thopught Having read the rave reviews of this hotel we too were very disappointed. The Hotel was clean and the towels changed daily. The breakfast was adequate and served by an excellent server. All the reviews had advised to seek an interior room and we did that. We booked for a week. Our room had no natural daylight an opaque panel window with no curtain showing light all night. We couldn't leave the window open as we could almost shake hands with the people in the room opposite the light shaft and as we were on the second floor(the first on this side of the hotel) it would be possible for someone to scale the window. Two army type metal framed beds. Roasting hot as the air con did not work and the hotel would not change our room. We feel the guide books recommend these interior rooms as noone who has seen them would book. We will not be returning.
