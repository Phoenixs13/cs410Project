<Content>WELL LOCATED Firstly this hotel is in an excellent location very close to sants train and metro station , it can be reached from the airport in 25 minutes.We booked on a stay 2 nights , 3rd night free deal which was excellent value. If you are planning on using the wi fi service then think again it costs 9 euros for 1 hour !! or 15 euros for 24 hours. A much better option is to use the internet cafe around the corner on carrer de numancia . It is very cheap at 1 euro per hour and is also very close to pans  co which is an excellent place to buy breakfast . it has a decent selection of small sandwiches and croissants , cakes etc ,excellent coffee and fresh orange juice. a typical breakfast of small ham and cheese ciabbatta , glass of freshly squeezed orange , coffee and cake would cost around 5 euros, which is a big saving on the 12 euro hotel breakfast.Barcelona is an excellent city for a short break, all the obvious sights are well worth a visit, if you intend to visit monjuic , the olympic stadium is free to enter and the olympic museum is worth a look at 3 euros i wouldnt bother with the cable car ride to the castle at the top of the hill. its a very short ride , it doesnt offer great views and is scandalously expensive . better to take your time and walk up or if thats not an option simply take a taxi from the metro station.If you visit sagrada familia (gaudi's cathedral) make sure you take the lift ride to the top of the tower it costs 2.50 euros but its a must.One last thing as in all big cities you have to watch your pockets and bags all the time , my advice would be leave the wallet in the hotel and just take whatever cash you minght need for the day.The metro is rife with petty thieves and pick- pockets that prey on tourists, I was talking to an english guy on the metro who was robbed whilst we were talking, neither of us saw a thing . !! they seem to operate in groups and when the metro is at its busiest.hope this review helps

<Content>Whatever you do at this hotel, don't have the breakfast. Poor value. Hotel was clean, but there is a communication problem with the staff, particularly in the resturant. Lovely friendly lady, but spoke not a word of English. The breakfast is very poor value. Don't have it! Cold coffee, cake like scrambled egg, and everything runs out very quickly and is not replaced. Cost is excessive at 12 euros per person. Extremely helpful Swiss gentleman on reception though. His English was better than mine!

<Content>NO non-smoking rooms... I read the reviews before I booked, but did not get the whole picture. The pics and info on the web look fine but I was disappointed:1. There were NO non-smoking rooms2. The room was small and odd shaped, which made matters worse.3. They are really stingy on the coffee at breakfast and you have to wait for the single, very elusive, kitchen staff to pop-in to the dining area before you can get coffee or a refill...very strange.4. A taxi drive to the Forum area at the sea-front costs about Euro 14 (Nov 2006). The train station, however, is only 2 blocks away.

<Content>Excellent! I only stayed at the Abbot for 2 nights with my boyfriend and all i can say is everything was excellent. It was abit of a nuissance to get to as we flew to Gerona, therefore we had to get a coach to barcelona (1 hour, 19 euros return) and as it was late we got a cab to the Abbot (7 euros). No way would you get a cab from Gerona as it would cost 125 euros!The room was immaculate, a tad small but spacious for 2 people and very comfortable. Lots of wardrobe space, lovely bathroom, satellite tv but only had spanish channels on - your not going to be watching television if your in barcelona anyway!The staff were very friendly and gave us a map of the city and how best to get to places. they recommended the metro, as would i. It's so easy to use and so cheap. we actually used it to get back to the coach station. You only pay once and can go all over the city, on different trains. The staff recommended the most gorgeous restaurant, which is in Port Olympic. It's called Marina Moncho's. It was very romantic, service was excellent and they do the most amazing fish dishes.overall, our trip was excellent and would definatley stay here again.

<Content>So-so, nothing special, nothing terrible The Hotel Abott is not old enough to be historically interesting and not new enough to be nice. Little TV, little bed, ok on cleanliness, slightly drab. Nothing about this hotel was especially good or bad, adequate. It is within walking distance of the subway but not in an area of interest to tourists. Your reason to stay here would be that you had business near by or wanted to be close to the train station (note that there are multiple train stations be sure what one you want) or you got a smoking deal. I don't say this place is terrible but as a tourist if I could do it again I would look elsewhere.

<Content>Not Thrilled We needed to stay over one night in Barcelona after departing our cruise before we could get a flight home. While the room rates were reasonable, there were many areas that were disappointing.We asked for two rooms (2 parents and children), however, they needed to give us three rooms because they could not accommodate our 2 children in one room. We were on different floors which made our kids uncomfortable. Further, 2 of the rooms did not have clean sheets, or if they were changed, there was still body hair etc on the sheets.While the rooms otherwise appeared clean, the air conditioning in one room only worked moderately. It was very hot and this was a much needed commodity. This property was close to the underground subway and was easy to reach Las Ramblas. It cost us 28 Euros to the airport (two cabs as there were 4 of us). I guess I am not accustomed to paying more than than the agreed upon price which was 20 Euros.Overeall, we should have paid the extra money and stayed in a more expensive hotel. Remember, only CNN is in english.

<Content>visited again! i stayed at this hotel 16-19 dec 04 again.i had a good deal at $60 euro's a night.the hotel is still very clean, although some rooms are bit on the small side, the only minus point for this hotel, is the noisy cleaning staff in the mornings, slamming doors  talking(more like shouting) .this time there was a definite lack of sleep
