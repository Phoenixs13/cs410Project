<Content>Noisy We stayed here for only one night as the next day we fly back home. We paid $56 US for the night including breakfast. For the price, the location was great, a few blocks away from the Zocalo and Catedral. The rooms are a little small and a bit dark but for one night it was okay. The bathroom didn鈥檛 have a divider so you cannot use it while someone is showering or you will get wet.Our main concern was that we couldn鈥檛 sleep due to the noise on the first floor. It was echoing and bouncing back on the four walls that the window was facing. We were hearing everything from people talking loud, singing loud, shouting, etc. At 2 am, we had to call the front desk to see if they can check what was going on and maybe get them to keep it low. It took maybe about 15-20 min for the noise to subside. After that we were able to sleep or we just got tired.

<Content>A Very Adequate Hotel at a good location and price I arrived at The Hotel Canada after my confirmed room at the Hotel Catedral was sold to someone else. The staff were welcoming. The room was small but reasonably equipped with door chain, bed, wardrobe, bedside light, safe and ensuite lavatory and shower. You have 30 min a day free use of the Holiday Inn internet along the road. For a traveller on a budget it was fine. I paid a bit under USD50 for BB the first night, rather less when I returned for a further 2 nights. The hotel is located near the Cathedral in the square (Zocalo) on Calle 5 Mayo, a block further on from the Zocalo Holiday Inn who owns this hotel. An excellent location for exploring the historic area.

<Content>Great Value/Helpful Staff We were recommended a different hotel on Avenue 5 de Mayo, however we found Hotel Canada and never looked back! The rooms are small, but clean and for AUD35 a night including breakfast, it was a great place to rest our heads at night.The staff there were more than happy to help us in any way they could and made our time in Mexico City much better.We hired a driver through the hotel called Eduardo (highly recommend him) and he drove us all around the city for a few days. We had our own private city tour.

<Content>A Decent Place to Stay in The Centro Historico Found the hotel whilst walking down Avenue 5 de Mayo and stumbled up the Hotel Canada. The rates are cheap, about $42.00 USD for a double room for two. The staff is helpful, friendly, and the rooms are also clean.My only suggestion: get a room by the street, for it is much cooler than the interior rooms. Safes are located in each room for your valuables.

<Content>clean, friendly, great location I am in Mexico quite ofter during the year and have been staying at the Hotel Canada for the past ten years of visits.The staff is friendly, full of information, most of the staff speaks at least some English and are more than willing to help in any way possible to make ones visit to the city a good one.There is a tourist desk located in the hotel that can fix you up with day trips, or longer ones if you desire, at resonable cost.It is an older hotel but has been kept up and is always clean and bright, some of the front rooms do catch some of the traffic noise from the street but not enough to really matter.The rates are great and it is close to many of the major attractions in the city.

<Content>Stay Here! I just got back from Mexico and while in Mexico City I stayed at the Hotel Canada. Just steps away from the Zocalo and many shops, restaurants, Alameda Park and the Palacio de Las Bellas Artes. After one night at another hotel (dark, dank, loud) I found this place (bright, friendly, clean and fairly quiet). For the price ($35 for a single), it was a steal considering the location. I'll definitely stay here my next trip!!
