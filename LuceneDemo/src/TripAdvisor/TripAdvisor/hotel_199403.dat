<Content>no charm..just a place to sleep Were given a room w/the view of a wall, so changed to street view. Not much better. No charm at this hotel. Utilitarian. No tub, just shower stall w/squeeze soap. Do they have to do that? A cake of soap is a small thing to ask..Large room. uncomfortabel,lumpy bed, TERRIBLE pillows. Good breakfast,full buffet w/omelettes made to order.

<Content>Very Good chioce!!! Been there 3 night's with my wife and baby boy (1.2 year old), got the junior suite upgrading free of charge. and i got to choose regular bed or water bed, took the second one again free of charge. the location is far from the center of berlin but not so far with urban train that locate 5 steps from the hotel, only 15 min away. easy to use and with a baby too. There 3 min walk to a great shopping mall and a cheap supermarket in the hotel building.Next time in berlin we will be there again.

<Content>OK but no A/C in the summer is hard Pros:- This hotel is very conveninently located to our Berlin site (within 5 mins walk) and makes for a very pleasant walk on the way to work - and back - everyday. - The breakfast buffet is excellent for the price (9 euros) and better if you could get it included in your room pricing. - Had dinner in the restaurant downstairs and the herrings were just superbly done (they are now in season). Say Hi! to Herr Schmidt - he will take great care of you as your waiting staff.- Super conveninent location of the Ubanh (subway) to anywhere else in Berlin and using a day pass if sightseeing (only 6 euros)- There is a mall right across from the hotel where you can purchase almost everything that you might need- There is a grocery shop next to the hotel where you can get snacks and drinks during your stayCons:- No A/C. I was there when it was over 30C and while there is a small portable fan in the room, it was clearly not enough. A revamp of the rooms with A/C unit would be most appreciated or even if there were some suites (I would pay the extra $$) with such amenities. - The snack vending machines in the hotel are rather lacking in variety so plan ahead and just go to the grocery store- No TV5 French Channel!! Almost everywhere else I go in Germany, I am able to catch my favourite French channel but not at this hotel- Wireless internet access is available through pay cards in installments of a number of hours. I found it rather expensive.- No easy access for ice cubes. I had to go fetch downstairs in the restaurant where they gave me a full bucket (yes, the one that you put the bottles in the ice) so not very convenient.- Room service menu is very limited. I tend to eat in the first night I arrive (jet-lagged and all)Due to its location and pricing, I will go back there but I just hope that it will be in the spring or fall and not the summer.
