<Content>Great Value - Great Service This was my first experience of Candlewood Suites and I pleased to have stayed here.It was recommended to me by the company which I was contracting for so I wasn't expecting it to be too great.However, the room was clean and comfortable, there was free high speed internet and the small kitchen area was more than sufficient for my needs.Service from the front desk was excellent and nothing was too much trouble - any problems being sorted immediately.I will most definitely stay here again when I'm in Phoenix - unless the company pays for a five star resort!!

<Content>Very Good Experience This was my first time at a Candlewood Suites and it is pretty much Holiday Inn's answer to Marriott's Towne Place. If you like one, you'll probably like the other.As noted, there's no daily maid service (gee, just like home), but there were more than enough towels for three nights. And you can swap them out at the desk if you need replacements.I was upgraded (Priority Club) to a suite with a bedroom which was nice. The suite is large enough, with TVs in both rooms and a DVD/VCR combo in the living room. I borrowed a free movie from the front desk. Bed was comfy. The room also has a full-size refrigerator/freezer, very handy. Unlike Marriott, they don't offer free breakfast here, but you have a coffee maker, microwave and range top, along with a full set of dishes/silverware and a dishwasher.Check-in and out was easy. Everyone was friendly, and they graciously let me stay a bit later so that my computer wouldn't melt in the car (the Internet, by the way, is wired and very good).The location is on the side of I-17, but it was quiet. Didn't use the pool, but it looked clean. Free washing machines were handy, with mini detergent boxes available for purchase. I left before the Wed. night pizza party, but it sounded nice.One thing -- they have one of those sensors that knows when you leave and hikes the room temperature to 77. Yes, it's the wave of the future, and yes, they have to save electricity. But when it's 112 outside, it takes longer than the promised 15 minutes to returned to the desired 70.Still, overall, this is a very good choice and I'd go back.

<Content>Good business stay This was a great hotel for a four night business stay. The staff were friendly and helpful. I was upgraded to a one-bedroom suite without asking. Housekeeping is not offered on a daily basis, but for a short stay, who really needs it? The room was stocked with plenty of towels, and more were available at the front desk, if needed. The kitchen was handy, especially the full size refrigerator. The selection in The Cupboard was suprisingly good. The bed and all of the other furniture were comfortable and in great condition. There is a movie lending library at the front desk. Pappadeaux Seafood Restaurant, two doors down, is fantastic, but is the only restaurant within easy walking distance. There are many dining options at the Metro Center Mall. The complimentary Wednesday night barbeque at the hotel was a nice touch.

<Content>Candlewood Phoenix We stayed at this hotel after we landed in Phoenix from New Jersey.Quick check in after a late flight was a pleasant surprise. Quick access out of phoenix the next morning to begin our roadtrip to grand canyon. Would recommend as a hotel at a good price as a stop over to other areas of Arizona.

<Content>OK despite the rude man at check in Hotel is nice, no frills. They have a weekly cookout by the pool which is very nice.I tried to check in early because I became ill on an early morning flight and was told by a very rude man at the desk that the room would be ready at 3:00. When I asked if there was any chance the room would be available early since I was ill, the man said in a very condescending voice,  I said the room will be ready at 3. Other than the rude check-in, I found the hotel to be very pleasant.

<Content>Not the best experience I was very disappointed with my experience at Candlewood Suites. I paid for a nonsmoking room in advance, but I was placed in a smoking room. When I approached the front desk about the problem, I was informed that it was the hotel's policy and there was nothing that could be done. I asked for a refund and stayed in another hotel in the area. This was fine with me because the rooms at Candlewood were noisy (right next to Black Canyon Hwy), there was no restaurant in the hotel, there were no pay per view movies, and the room wasn't in the best condition. Overall, I was very unimpressed with the hotel and the service I received while I was there.

<Content>The pool was nice My family stayed at this Candlewood for a week and we had a really good experience here. Our kids loved being able to go swimming in the heated pool(when it worked). The staff was extremely helpful when you asked for something and they were very kind. LOVED THE FREE LAUNDRY! And videos you could check-out to your room. We also liked the little convient store that they had. The whole place seemed clean and had a clean smell too.
