<Content>Good value We booked to stay in this hotel during the world cup when hotel prices seemed quite high. This hotel was reasonable and although at first we thought we were some way from the actual city centre (it was our first visit to Berlin) we walked back from the main shopping street the first night and it was only 20 minutes walk. After that we did not use the subway much, it was much easier and more interesting to use our street map to get around on foot. We walked back pretty late some nights and never felt threatened. Having said that there is a metro station just 5 minutes walk from the hotel.The receptionist was excellent he really went out of his way to help us, not just answering questions but greeting us with information he thought we might be interested in. There was no financial motivation it just seemed to a genuine desire to help us and also show off a city he was obviously proud of.The room was more of an apartment with a kitchenette attached. In fact the building seemed more like apartments than a hotel but the room was definitely up to 3 star standard with a good sized bathroom and extremely clean. No complaints about the room and a quiet location with no traffic noise at all.Breakfast was a cold buffet but there was the option to eat outside in the garden which was pleasant.If we went back to Berlin we would use this hotel again.
