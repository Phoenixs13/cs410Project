<Content>Les Nations Visited Berlin on business for 4 days and for me the location was ideal. Out of the city but close to where I wanted to be. There was a bus stop very close by and the local buses into town were at very frequent intervals. The staff at Les Nations were very friendly and helpful. The room I had was large, clean and had all the amenities I wanted. There is not bar but the location was close to lots of restaurants etc. Only a small hotel but a good find.
