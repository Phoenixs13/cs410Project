<Content>Good low cost accomadation in Berlin 9 of us stopped here in October 2008. I had booked 3 triple rooms via the hotel website. On arrival we were placed in 3 rooms with 6 beds in each! The cost per person for 3 nights was 96 Euros which included breakfast.Breakfast is served from 7am until noon in the bar/reception area on the 4th floor. It consisited of a wide selection of cereals, fruit, cheeses, cooked meats and bread. Coffee and Tea were available. Orange Juice was 1.5 Euros at the bar.The rooms were very large. There was no TVs in the rooms. The bathrooms were basic but clean, The showers were especially powerful. My room over looked the courtyard.The hotel had a bar at reception which stayed open until about 3am. Smoking is allowed in the bar which pleased and displeased some of our group.The Transit is situated just off a main street. It's handy for the nightlife in Bergmanstrasse, and if you want to travel further afield then the U-Bahn station (Mehringdham) is about a 6-8 minute walk.Overall I thought the hotel was value for money. The rooms were clean, the staff were courteous and helpful, and the location was good.

<Content>never go anywhere else I have taken university art students to Berlin on numerous occasions and we always stay in either the Hotel Transit or the Transit Loft. I have never had a unpleasant experience. The staff are friendly and efficient, the rooms are basic, contemporary and clean, I haven't been in a hostel that compares with value for money and quality. The bar is open 24 hours and its in a brilliant location, with plenty of places to eat and drink with some local stores.I thoroughly recommend it.

<Content>Best showers in all Europe I love this hotel! It is a renovated cigar factory - so the ceilings are very high and the windows are huge. All the rooms open onto the central courtyard and are flooded with sunlight. So is the large common room, making breakfast a delight. The rooms are done all in white and grey - comfortable, spotlessly clean, and tastefully spare. I took the bargain rate, as I have no qualms about a bath down the hall. The bathroms are large, there is never a wait, and the Transit has the best showers in all Europe - a torrent of hot water.The checkin desk doubles as a bar - open all day and half the night, always tended by friendly people.Best part: you are in an interesting, vibrant, nieghborhood, not on the tourist route. A short walk to the nearest U-Bahn puts you anywhere in the city within a few minutes. John BlackWashington, DC
