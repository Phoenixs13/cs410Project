<Content>Dreams more like nightmare We just got back from this resort. It is a two star at best. There were so many problems small and large that I could not list them all. I am not a picky person and could probably have slept on the beach all week, but if you pay for a 4-5 star resort, you would expect better.The resort is not ready to have guests. Most families waited from 3 to 8 hours for a room. We saw and spoke to about 20-30 families over the first two days having the same problems as us. We arrived at 2 and got a room at 7:00pm. Some did not get rooms until 12:00 in the morning. They had no room keys so they told us to get a guard to open the doors. Trying to find a guard when you needed was a chore. We had three rooms. No A/C in one, the fan in the second room made so much noise that we could not run it while in the room or at night, no control of the A/C in the third (50F or 80). They ran out of beach towels several times a day. They ran out of vodka several times and we had to wait til the next day. You need to get up early to get a lounge chair on the beach and even earlier to get one at the pool. We saw many argument about stolen chairs. The food is just average. Getting reservations at the habachi tables in the habachi restaurant is a trick. You need to get there by 5:45 and wait until 6:30 when it opens to get in line to make reservations for 1 of the 9 seating available the entire evening. The wind here was 20-30 miles per hour with rain every day but that was not their fault. However, dozens of rooms had the roof leak over their beds and complained parts of the ceiling were falling on them as they slept. The halls are always flooded during the rain. Two inches in our room by the door. My sons room door would not lock and we had to wait two hours for a repair man to come fix it. The state of the art Gym is a small room with 1960 bar bells. Our three rooms had no cable TV however I did figure out how to connect them myself and program the TV channels. There were no towel racks or toilet paper holders in the bathrooms. No handles on the shower or toilet doors. Room service was non existent unless you called several times. Rooms were made each day by 6-7:00pm. We always were out of bath towels. We had suites (Preferred Club) but there were no drawers to put our clothes. My wife kept hers in the night table drawers and I used my suitcase. The floors in the rooms and parts of the lobby are smooth tile that were like sheets of ice when wet. We fell or slipped many times. Watch for parts of the sand that has cement chunks exposed (that hurt). Looks like left over from construction. One of three Hobi sailboats were broken making lines very long making there first come first serve policy anoying. We had to stand there for up to 1-2 hours to get the next available one. Well I could go on forever but this should be enough for you to make your decision. There are too many great resorts out there to waste your time on this one.

<Content>Lacking many simple things Dec.28th -Jan.4th we just got back . The resort is beautiful and clean,the staff is extremely friendly and will go out of there way to make you happy. That is about the end of my good remarks. They over booked many rooms and gave new people checking in keys to our room twice. So always put the chain lock on! Many things didn't work like many toilets and our safe, there were also ants in some rooms. There is a problem there with people saving lounge chairs and towels. Or maybe there just isn't enough to go around. Expect the staff to enter your room 4 times a day. Once to make the beds, once to replace towels, once to stock the mini fridge and once to turn down your beds. The beds are not very big. Really to small for two average sized people. We used Apple vacations and they were very good at helping us out. Also the group with the hotel taking pictures were very good.

<Content>Can't wait to return! We returned last Thursday from an absolutely wonderful vacation. We arrived at the hotel on Christmas morning and was greeted with many smiling faces, champagne and some baked treats. When we were waiting to check-in we found a rep. and mentioned to them that we were booked in a preferred club room and were immediately taken to the preferred club lounge and checked-in within 5 minutes.We stayed in a ground floor room with two double beds. Another traveler had warned us that the ground floor rooms had flooded when it had previously rained, and although it rained while we were there, thankfully nothing flooded.The rooms were beautiful! Even though the room was not made up until the evening for the first three days, the last 4 days the room was made up and cleaned in the morning and touched up again in the evening.There were next to no mosquitoes which was great.Christmas day was wonderfully planned for the kids. They had everyone come to the beach where Santa circled in a helicopter waving to the kids. Later he came onto the resort via horseback and all of the kids were able to sit on him, take pictures and received a nice little present!We enjoyed the beach and all of the pools very much. They worked hard to clean up any sea grass that may have washed up due to the rain.The evening entertainment was very nice, especially the circus evening that was very much like a mini cirque de solei show!My family is vegetarian and was able to find things to eat at every meal and were shocked to find veggie burgers in the preferred club restaurant! The Italian restaurant was great!New Years eve was amazing, and all guests received very nicely wrapped hats and party favors...champagne was abundant! At midnight there was an amazing fireworks show!We loved every moment of our trip and plan to return in the near future.

<Content>Needs a lot more time to be good We arrived December 25/08 and departed January 1/09. We where fortunate to have got a room that didn't leak, flood or be overwhelmed with mosquitoes but we did come close as the rooms across the hall flooded which we later found out had flooded more than once.We paid the extra for the Preferred Club to help make sure we got the better service, room, drinks, food, internet and some privacy. Well..... what a complete waist of money and rip-off. There was only one item on the brochure description that was unique to the Preferred Club which was the breakfast and lunch at one restaurant otherwise NOTHING and those that booked standard rooms got everything the same. Other people that had problems with their rooms and proceeded to [--] and complain where upgraded to the Preferred Club at no extra cost but all that they really got was a better room since everything else was the same.During the renovation a lot of money was spent on the wrong things and the hotel will pay in the end. - Plate glass partitions in shower stall and raised vanity sinks in washroom but the toilet seats are the cheapest plastic and already cracking. - There are obvious major problems with sewer lines and plumbing. The staff are constantly fixing clogged pipes and the smell of sewage is prevalent nearly everyday.- There is a major shortage of lounges and a conservative estimate would be at least 150 more are required.- Staff are overwhelmed and they have a policy not to take reservations at the restaurants so at 6:30 every night the restaurants get inundated with a crowd of people all at once instead of controlling the crowd by utilizing reservations and filling in the slack with walk ins if space allowed.The usual excursion rip offs are alive and well and surprisingly the Sunwing rep seems to be a part of it as we heard he was reluctant to make change and the Saona Island trip we took was not worth the money although he highly recommended it.We won't be back and will not recommend anyone to go.

<Content>Lacks Integrity I was in DPB from Dec 21-28 with my husband celebrating our anniversary. We arrived with an open mind, knowing they had just opened 8 days earlier. Our thought was, 鈥淥f course there are going to be glitches and things to work out鈥hings happen even in established resorts.鈥?We arrived early evening to find we had to wait for our room. We thought check-in was at 3 pm, and by now it was almost 9 pm and still no room. No problem, we thought鈥et鈥檚 just go for a drink! We finally get a room but no key鈥e were told a guard would let us in. (we didn鈥檛 get a key for over 24 hrs and had trouble at times finding our guard) ANYWAY鈥?we were thrilled to throw our stuff down and get a start on our vacation! We didn鈥檛 want to waste a minute! As soon as we walked in our room we had a HUGE WELCOME TO PUNTA CANA ! No, not rose petals on the floor leading to the bed鈥ope, not a bottle of champagne鈥︹€?nope鈥ot a running jacuzzi鈥︹€︹€︹€?.nope鈥ot a fruit basket and chocolates! It was a swarm of mosquitos!! Yicks we said鈥hey must have put us in the wrong room鈥?we didn鈥檛 request the 鈥渏ungle safari special鈥?!! My husband is great at swatting bugs so he grabbed the only towel in the room and surely woke up the people next door! As soon as he killed some鈥ore appeared!!! I let him have fun while I refreshened up! Y IPPY! I get to throw on some new clothes and start partying! I go into the bathroom and oops鈥he toilet does not work. It is old鈥ooks original from at least 2 resorts ago鈥as huge rust stains in the toilet and on the seat, and there is water on the floor. I won鈥檛 mention what else was floating around! I thought to myself, 鈥渉mmm, I thought this place was newly remodeled. 鈥?I see a new sink and bed and some new paint on the wall, a new flat screen TV, but that鈥檚 it. Oh well! As we start to inspect the room we see a mini fridge that is full鈥EAH! But as we grab a beer it is warm! Oh no! The fridge doesn鈥檛 work!!! I settle in for some TV watchin鈥?as my husband keeps swatting and DARN! No remote! The nice big flat screen is so inviting鈥ut when I turned it on it was SNOWY! It reminded me of what I came to Punta Cana for鈥o get away from the SNOW !!!!No worries I think鈥?I鈥檒l let my husband keep practicing his karate moves and I鈥檒l order room service! Yummy鈥 love room service鈥?and look and look鈥nd see no menu. No big deal I think鈥 guess that means I can order whatever I want! I keep looking and realize there is NO PHONE! I finally convince my husband it is time to stop the killing spree and we go to reception. As we leave we realize the door does not shut! The door is too big for the jam. We leave it open and hope our things are safe.I speak Spanish so I skip to reception knowing in my heart they will take care of us鈥?.it鈥檚 our anniversary of course! I smile and tell the man behind the counter my issues. Mainly the toilet. He says. 鈥渟orry mame, we have no room to give you. We are all booked up. Don鈥檛 worry we will fix your toilet in a couple days!! 鈥?A COUPLE DAYS I THINK? OH NO!! I try for the next few hours to speak to anyone who would listen, but to no avail. We walk back to our room with our heads hung low. As we get to our room we notice the door is now SHUT. Hmm鈥aybe we are just at the wrong room we think鈥?.nope鈥?..we are at the right room. We look for the guard鈥nd the hall is dark. There is no one in sight. We walk back to reception and tell them our predicament. They PROMISE they will send the guard to open our room. This ritual of walking back and forth goes on for at least 45 mins! Finally, the guard appears and tells us, 鈥渙h, its easy, you have to move the door this way, then this way, then do this and then this鈥nd SEE, NOW IT WILL OPEN and CLOSE! (good thing I took notes during that!!!)Anyway鈥︹€︹€︹€y husband finally made progress with the guys at reception and we were moved to a much nicer room. Our first day was pretty much a waste. Hey! Look on the bright side鈥?. we got lots of exercise walking back and forth from building 6 to reception!! We were given a nice suite in building 5. It had a couple problems too. (toilet ran non stop) We named this room the 鈥渞ainforest room鈥?! Who would have thought we would have our own waterfall in our room! (leaky ceiling!) After we got settled in our room my husband realized he left something in the 鈥渏ungle safari鈥?room. He went back and knocked on the door. A young couple had just arrived and were very upset with the mosquitoes and non functioning toilet. They said, 鈥渉urry...come on in鈥hut the door鈥e don鈥檛 want to let any more mosquitoes in here!鈥?I know I have been light hearted so far as I write this review , so here are some comments in a more serious tone:Let鈥檚 review our first room disaster: Why would this resort put another couple in our same room, less than 12 hrs later when the room wasn鈥檛 ready?? We spoke to the other couple a day later and they had to move鈥hy? The mosquitoes, no phone, fridge broken, TV not working, and toilet did not work. This type of attitude from Dreams that 鈥淥h well, maybe we can just find a sucker to take that room who won鈥檛 say anything,鈥?is NOT acceptable and cannot be overlooked.I was getting change at reception when a woman who had checked in 8 hours prior and was thrilled to get her room, came back very upset. She put the key on the counter and said, 鈥淪ir, this room has people in it鈥hey were in bed!鈥?She received no reaction from the man behind the counter. Not even a simple apology. I saw her the next day and she got a new room 4 hours later but had no hot water. I told her that she and her family were welcome to use our bathroom/shower. We had a great trip despite the unexpected weather, the bad food in the buffet and the initial room disaster. The food in the restaurants varied, but overall was very good and MUCH better than the buffet. We loved the sushi in the Asian restaurant as well as the seaside grill and Italian place. The French restaurant was not good for us. The service improved every day that we were there. Although this resort has been renovated it appears to be sporadic. Some new items, some original. Some of the toilets are not new, some of the showers are not either. Some guests think of ALL NEW when they hear a resort has been renovated. The quality of 鈥渘ew items鈥?is average so I do not see this place holding up well. The lamps are wobbly, doors don鈥檛 close properly, chairs are flimsy in certain areas, the cloth on pool chairs is already coming off the foam. I say within a year this place will not look like it has been renovated and will quickly show wear and tear.I can鈥檛 stress enough鈥?when we arrived at DPB I could care less that we had no flowers in the vases, no binder notebook on the resort offerings, no toilet paper holder, no hooks, no do not disturb sign, no evening turn down service, bad a/c. We were even ok with no working TV, mini fridge that didn鈥檛 worked, original shower and toilet even though this place was renovated, no darking curtains, flooding hallways and ceilings, lack of booze at times esp. vodka, having to wait hours for a room, lack of beach towels at times as early as noon, beach with seaweed and cigarette butts鈥?all of that was tolerable and understandable since they just opened鈥?.what I could not accept was being in a room infested with mosquitoes and one without a working toilet and told 鈥渙h, miss, it will be fixed in a couple days鈥?we have no place to put you.鈥?That, plus knowing they put another young couple in that room without fixing it鈥hat lack of integrity showed me I do not want to patron DREAMS resorts in the future.We heard and observed all sorts of things during our stay. I feel the people we met were kind hearted, caring people and were respectful with the staff. The travelers I met had the same thought we did when we arrived鈥?and did not expect perfection鈥?A TOILET MAYBE, BUT NOT PERFECTION) They just wanted a nice, simple vacation with a comfortable room for their family. Period.We had a great trip despite all the drama鈥e liked and disliked some things, were disappointed and surprised with other things , and concerned for others while we were here. On a positive note鈥?we did meet a few people that had no horror stories. They said 鈥渨e feel lucky compared to others. 鈥?So, of course鈥ome families were perfectly content. They all had minor issues whether it be an issue in the room or with the food, but like all trips, you take those things in stride.I feel very lucky that we were eventually moved to a nicer room and I let the management know on numerous occasions how pleased we were. Our last day there we had to wait over 6 hrs in the lobby (we had fun!) and what I observed and heard as people were coming and going really surprised me. (I鈥檒l leave it at that) I am thinking there will be a flood of new posts on TA within the next month or two.Important note to those going to DBP soon: There is ONE thing you just can鈥檛 forget to bring鈥︹€?.and that is a GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR. You will definitely need it!After being home and reflecting, we laugh about how much fun we had in Punta Cana. I love the country, the people and their spirit. I loved speaking Spanish while I was there and meeting people from all over the world. Bottom line:What kind of resort would 鈥?.-put a guest in a room that is not ready to be occupied and then tell try to convince you to stay in that room?-tell you over and over a 鈥済uard鈥?is in the building at all times and will let you in, when in reality no one was there!-put another couple in a room that they KNOW is not acceptable?-boast to guests at check in and in their manual that they have 鈥渓ate check out鈥?and they encourage you to ask about it at reception. When you do, they chuckle and say 鈥淲e don鈥檛鈥?offer that service. Who told you that?鈥?br/>-tell you they have a hospitality room in building 2 for people who check out at noon but do not leave until evening? Then, when you ask to use this room to shower, they say, 鈥淲e don鈥檛 have such a room, go use the bathroom in the spa.鈥?br/>Let鈥檚 look at it this way: let鈥檚 say you go to a new car dealership in your town. Everyone is excited about the new car place鈥hey are offering great deals and all sorts of things to attract you to their dealership! You get there鈥nd find out the car they have advertised is not available. You are so upset鈥his is the CAR of your DREAMS! You ask them when it will arrive and they say, oh, not sure, but we will get back to you. You say, 鈥漛ut your ad said it would be here today and ready to test drive!鈥?You are told, sorry, not much we can do. So, you move on to another vehicle you like and ask to take it for a test drive. It sure looks like the one in the ad from this morning鈥檚 paper鈥?.you hop in excited to finally be able to take it for a spin! You quickly find out it has no a/c or heat, no radio, no power steering, no seat belts鈥ot even windshield wipers. Gee you think鈥LL cars have windshield wipers, don鈥檛 they? It doesn鈥檛 matter鈥?you still like the car and want to see what else it has to offer. As you look down, and try to put the car in reverse you are perplexed鈥?no reverse? You ask the salesperson, hey, what鈥檚 going on here; He says, 鈥漮h, that鈥檚 not a problem. Who needs reverse anyway. 鈥?You say, hey, this is not the car you have advertised! This isn鈥檛 the one I saw in your PICTURE? It doesn鈥檛 have anything you said it did in your ad! And he says, 鈥渨ell, you know 鈥︹€?we just opened so we don鈥檛 have those yet and I know鈥e still have some kinks to work out鈥?and besides鈥ts nice on the outside, isn鈥檛 it? 鈥?You ask if maybe the price will be cheaper since it is missing all these basic amenities and the salesperson laughs out loud and says 鈥淚鈥檓 sorry sir, we just can鈥檛 do that. We have such a demand for these cars, and we have no room to negotiate. 鈥淵ou walk away in dismay鈥?and as you get in your car you see family after family going through exactly what you just did鈥eeling duped!Ok, I think you get my point. This dealership would be out of business within a week!!Ok, now back to DPB: in conclusion鈥︹€︹€?The lack of integrity is what bothers me most about Dreams Palm Beach. It would have been so refreshing to hear a staff member say :鈥渕ame, you should not have been given that room. It was not ready, we are sorry and we will fix this situation for you.鈥?OR,  鈥渕ame, we do state that we have late check-out in our guest resort book but we do not offer that service yet.鈥?OR, 鈥淚 know we offered the hospitality room to you, but it is not available now. 鈥?A simple, honest answer when things go wrong is what people want, not the run around.The bottom line for me鈥︹€?DPB lacks what would be needed for my return visit鈥︹€?鈥NTEGRITY.

<Content>Beautiful pools - needed a lot more than 25 million dollars renovation Also just came back and was also disppointed.I chose the prefered room. They put us in building 3. The roof was leaking, the door knob stayed in my hand when I tried to close it, the bathroom toilet did not flush, the balcony door was stuck and the television, which did not have a remote, was not working properly. We complained the next day and two hours later we had a new room in building 4. This room was beautiful, with a jacuzzi. However, the toilet also had a problem. It made loud noises for 5 minutes after EACH flush. We always had to ask for extra towels, or for toilet paper. The 'fully stocked' bar only had water, two cokes and two beers.When we arrived, the hotel was almost empty and the service was great. Two days later, the hotel was full and the waiters at the restaurants, at the pool, the bars...were overwhelmed and service was incredibly slow.The teen club was a joke. A small cabin with one Wii, one chess game and one table tennis. The monitor there was playing by himself with the Wii and my son kept asking if he could have a turn. Furthermore, the daily schedule was advertising teen volleyball, soccer ...but those activities were usually cancelled. The monitor could not even tell us when the next teen activity would take place.Food was very good, especially the french and italian restaurants.WARNING: there are absolutely no ATM machines in the entire resort, and nobody, from the concierge, to the reception area or the stores could make change. This was a problem when we ran out of singles or five dollar bills for tipping. Tipping is expected anywhere you go if you want to get service the next time. However, at the end of my vacation, I did not feel like tipping 10 or 20 dollars each time someone brought me a drink.I sound very fussy, but trust mew when I tell you that I never before gave a negative review of a hotel.All in all, I would definitely not recommand this resort to any of my friends.

<Content>El Paiso Lluvioso=Paradaise of Rain We took our kids on this trip (15 m.o and 3 y.o) departing on Dec 22-26. This was a 4 hr direct flight from our city, so we got there around noon, yet our check-in and room availability was only by 3:30 (Apple Vacations should do better with arranging flights closer to check-in time). With little kids who want to nap, rest and settle in after the trip, waiting for 3,5 hours in the lounge to get a room is unbearable for kids and parents :( We had one day of sun--the day we arrived, the rest of our trip rained almost every 30 min. The beach was very windy, sand-stormy, big waves and strong current.Hotel: every time it rained, the first floor flooded with water seeping into the rooms. Management had workers put towels next to everyones door, and they were cleaning it up.I did not like the fact that there was a shower stall instead of a tub. It's much easier to bathe kids in a tub without taking a shower yourself. Also I did not care for the design of the bathroom-- that the toilet+shower is in a seperate room, or partition from the sink. The beds were very comfortable- the only (+) about the room.Service: Overall needs improvement in responsibility about fulfilling customers requests. It seems when asked-whether at the restaurant or room concerns- workers always get someone else to look into it. Especially this phenomenon is evident in restaurants. We order drinks and the server would tell another server or worker to get the drinks for our table. I'm not sure if they have assigned tables or work around the room, but a lot of requests go unfufilled and many drinks we did not get.The evening entertainment at the lounge sounded like the worst karioke (I heard distant dogs howling).Few good restaurants that fall under the all-inclusive: A Japanese one and another one called The Patio open for evening dining. Men have a dress code-no open-toe shoes or shorts (depends who is the host that evening), women on the other hand can get in wearing next to nothing- daisy dukes and flip-flops--I did not like this double standard.Would not recommend this resort

<Content>Simply put - a great holiday We have arrived to the Dreams Palm Beach hotel on 13th of December in its opening day after reconstruction. We spent here a great week of our family vacation. As of the beginning of our stay here everything act to us with very positive impression. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.We were accommodated in the first block just in front of the beach. Room was very nice and reasonably equipped. Perhaps the beds were too soft. We should only comment on the room service. Cleaning the rooms was usually after 3PM. Our minibar was not completed once during our stay. Catering was absolutely excellent. Breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet in the restaurant were great and varied. We spent nice time in the lobby bar, where the bartenders prepared excellent long drinks. Inside the hotel are two swimming pools. Around them are plenty of sunbeds with beach towels. The beach in front of the hotel is very nice covered with white sand. On the beach are grown palm trees that provide shadow. Under palms are plenty of sunbeds for all clients. The beach is cleaned every day by hotel staff. This wonderful beach is reserved only for the hotel guests and there are no local vendors bothering by offering their souvenirs. The water in the sea is very nice and clear. After about 500 meters north of the hotel beach begins wild beach, which extends about 6 km to the main hotel area in Playa Bavaro. Dreams Palm Beach Hotel is located in a quiet location along with other 3 hotels and is an ideal place for those who want to spend a peaceful holiday.

<Content>Good idea, poor performance We just came back from the hotel. In general the experience was positive, the amenities are very nice. However, there were way too many small problems like: no straws at the resort on our first day (Dec17), no ice (dec 23) so kids could not order any cold drinks, no hot water in the room (twice during 7 days stay), no water in the public washrooms( several times). Our bed was broken, and took 3 days to chase the maintenance to fix it...To sum up:Kids club - very good 5/5 open till 22:00!!! With rich programFood 鈥?buffet 5/5 al a carte 2/5 (compared to our experience with Bahia Principe Punta Cana)Beach / Pool 鈥?4/5Service 鈥?2/5 (depends on which day, last Monday mini bar was not refilled at all and room cleaning came at 15:00, the advertised 鈥渢urn down鈥?service happened only once in proper way)Value 鈥?5/5

<Content>Dreams Palm Beach - An Excellent Resort Arrived at Dreams Palm Beach on Dec. 20 from Toronto, just a week after the resport re-opened after a 6 month renovation and upgrading of the entire property including grounds, rooms and amenities. Check-in was prompt and we were warmly welcomed by the staff. Shown to a beaufiful room overlooking the pool. Lots of chairs and huts on the beach so no reason to get up early in the morning and reserve chairs. We have eaten at several of the restaurants since arriving and the food and service are the very best we have ever had at any resort. It is almost as if AMResorts has taken the very best of their Dreams properties and combined it all into this one. The entertainment staff keep things jumping all day and the bar located in the main lobby is a jumping spot in the evening with the best and most entertaining bartenders I have ever seen.Problems? A few minor things that I have heard from guests such as a telephone not working or the AC needing repair in a room. (we had this problem and it was repaired promptly). Need room service? 20 minutes from ordering to your room. I have spoken with many guests since arriving and have not heard one major complaint; any minor ones were promptly tended to. Actually, I have been thoroughly impressed that with having only been open a week before we arrived that the resort was up and functioning at 100%.Cannot say enough about the staff who are thoroughly trained in the restaurants, activities area (including the Explorer's Club for younger children), grounds maintenance, bars, etc. Service is always friendly and prompt.We will be heading home on Dec. 27 and will most certainly be returning again next year to Dreams Punta Cana. Dreams Palm Beach is excellent value for the money when compared to other 5 star resorts in the Dominican Republic.
