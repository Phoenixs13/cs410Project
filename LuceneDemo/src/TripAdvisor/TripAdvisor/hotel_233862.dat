<Content>Nice hotel The hotel is a little far out of the centre ( a bus ride away) but it's good value. Nice and clean.

<Content>Hotel was overbooked, but good solution During the ITB Exhibition I tried to stay at the Alfa Hotel. Yes, tried, because the hotel was overbooked. Although I had a guaranteed reservation, the hotel told me I had to go to the Angleterre Hotel. The Alfa Hotel paid the taxi and the Angleterre is a better and nicer hotel than Hotel Alfa. So I didn't had much to complain!

<Content>Good hotel close to Public Transport Stayed here for three nights at the start of November. Weather was fine and not too cold. Room was very good the only slight disappointment was the breakfast but we got enough to do us. As a previous writer we used the M27 bus which took us to and from Turmstr Underground (5min) The buses run every 5-10 min and then use the underground to get to wherever. As you come out of the hotel Turmstr station is to the left and Mierendorfplatz station is to the right. Bus M27 runs between them both. Bus stops in either direction are just a few yards from the hotel door.

<Content>Good Hotel, especially if you are not afraid of walking! A very good hotel, spacious rooms, very good breakfast. Weather was excellent during our stay so the walk to Brandenburg Gate, which took an hour, was very pleasant - half of it through the park and, because public transport is so good, it is amazingly traffic free for a capital city. It is a brisk 20 minute walk to Turmstrasse underground station, slightly less to Mierendorfplatz. We didn't use the bus, but there looked to be plenty close by. Schloss Charlottenberg is within easy walking distance from the hotel. We chose the hotel to be away from the hustle, bustle and noise, but still experienced some traffic noise early on Monday morning. Altogether an excellent stay, I just wonder if we would have found it a bit far out if it the weather had been bad?

<Content>Good Value, Quality and Service The Alfa is a comfortable and good 4 star hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet is good and caters for all from eggs to ceral. Rooms are quiet, clean and really good size with a little balcony overlooking a little garden below.The only drawback is that it is a 10 min bus ride not a walk from stations Mierendorfplatz and Turmstr. To walk would take 25min.There is however a TXL bus (10 min walk toward Turmstr) which runs to most of your tourist haunts, last stop Alexanderplatz which is what we used all week.
