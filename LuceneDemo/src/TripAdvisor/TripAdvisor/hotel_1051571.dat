<Content>Great location, nice hotel, noisy I'm very glad I booked a 2 night stay with Hotel Atlas after staying 1 night at Husa Via Barcelona far from the city center (misleading description). Atlas's location could not possibly be better - 5 second walk from La Rambla and right across from the Boqueria or food market. The only 2 downsides I can think of for Atlas are that it gets really noisy from about 8am on. The bell from the cathedral goes off and there is a lot of noise coming from the street. If you plan on waking up early, this should not deter you though as Atlas is a great value and an unbeatable location.

<Content>Clean and modern hotel in a great location This is a good hotel in a great location (near the middle of the Ramblas and handy for the Liceu metro stop). The rooms are clean and modern with a good power shower.Didn't have any problems with noise and the windows appeared double glazed (our room was on the 3rd floor at the side looking onto a quiet street).The only negatives were the breakfast which was pretty dismal. The breads were all long life tastless stuff, croissants with a 2 month shelf tasted horrible. It wouldn't take much to get something fresh from a local bakery.

<Content>Great location, shame about the noise!! Great location, just off La Rambla and a few steps from the Metro.Very clean, modern with friendly staff who all speak excellen english. The hotel is small with just 21 rooms, reception desk and a small breakfast area. Break fast were simple but adequate, cereal various breads, ham, cheese fruit and yogurt with tea or coffee. Bread rooms are clean, comfortable with good sized bathrooms, tv and air conditioning.Major downside was the noise from outside. No double glazing and this meant nights were particularly noisy as revellers returned home after a night out. If you are on a short break this hotel would be a great choice as it is within easy reach of all the major sights and shopping. Just don't forget the earplugs!

<Content>Excellent hotel in great location My wife and I booked this hotel with less than 1 week remaining before we stayed there, and we were extremely happy with it. It is situated just off La Rambla, and is a very modern and comfortable hotel.The two bed room that we had was a good size, bigger than most others we stayed in around Europe, and was clean and modern. Wi-fi access was provided free in the room, and it also contained a small flatscreen TV on the wall.The location is fantastic, with plenty of places to eat, shop and buy souvenirs all around the hotel. Being reasonably close to La Rambla there can be a bit of noise late at night, but nothing significant enough to keep you awake.There was nothing negative to really say about the hotel, and we'd recommend it if you can get a decent price.

<Content>It's all about location We booked this hotel on a business trip to BCN and choose this one, because it is new and close to the Boqueria, the famous markets. We did stay at the Atlas Hotel for 2 nights June 19-21.They do serve complementary breakfast in the lobby area next to the elevator - nothing special - cornflakes, toast, cheese, ham yoghurt, coffee, orange juice and some sweet stuff. We never had breakfast, because we preferred the Boqueria for the tortillas and the atmosphere there in the mornings.The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and the aircon was very silent so sleeping was no problem. Of course there is noise out on the streets - but hey, we are in the main tourist area here and bars are all around.The Tapas bar, next door is excellent.We would definitively book the Atlas again for our next trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Good hotel - Great location The Hotel Atlas is brand new ... open just 40 days when we checked in (June 11, 2008). The rooms, elevator, and hallways are on the small side, the floors are covered with linoleum, there is a church bell that rings every half hour from 8:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. that the sound proofing does not keep out, and it helps if you like orange walls and bedspreads, but these detractions were insignificant relative to the benefits this hotel offered.The bathroom had modern facilities and we found the beds to be very comfortable. The staff speaks several languages including English and were very friendly and helpful. They were very attentive when we couldn't figure out how to work the air conditioner and were happy to give us directions and recommendations of places to go and things to see. The hotel offers breakfast that, considering the price we were paying, was fairly extensive. It consisted of cold cereal, breads, fruit, meat and cheese slices, fruit juices, and a machine that made several types of coffee.The best selling point of Hotel Atlas is its location right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, the heart of Barcelona. The area has countless pedestrian friendly walkway, especially a street called The Ramblas, filled with cafes and shops. The Mercat de la Boqueria, a covered food market filled with vendors hawking everything from fruit juices to meats, fish and wine is two blocks away. There is an internet cafe just around the corner, and the beach is an enjoyable 25 minute stroll from the hotel. The Liceu subway stop is within 200 feet and the Plaza Catalunya where one can catch the tour buses is a ten minute walk. While we were warned to be wary of pickpockets, we felt safe walking back to the hotel even at midnight.Hotel Atlas is not the Four Seasons, but at 70 Euros a night vs. 400+ a night for the Four Seasons, it is a great value for the money.

<Content>Barcelona is great We booked this hotel mainly because of its location, just a few steps from La Rambla. Its a bit overpriced, doesnt have minibar, restaurant, no breakfast and no bar..but somehow this was ok, just step outside and you麓ll have no problems to find something to eat. Quite noisy outside on the street. Lots of britts, drunk and carrying on late...not the hotels fault tho.Nice bathroom. They did not seem to use locks at the hotel tho. Once when we came back from a day out on the town we found our door open. Luckily noone had gone inside and nothing was missing. The door next to our room was also open, we looked inside and saw someones luggage and shoes but noone was there...the maid must have forgotten to lock the doors..Overall hotells are very expensive in Barcelona, especially close to the main attractions.Barcelona has lots to offer, its a very beautiful city and we will surely return.

<Content>Great location, helpful friendly staff, Got back yesterday. I rated this hotel excellent for it offers what it claims. It is no 5 star in that it lacks services such as breakfast, pools etc but for those who only look for a good clean place to stay it is excellent. Pros - Very good location.Friendly knowledgable staff. Clean. Brand new rooms.Free Wi-fi though not very strong. Fantastic power shower. nice spacious rooms.Better than expected.Free maps in Lobby.Info desk well stocked with different maps( shopping maps, restaurant maps, Bus touristic maps) and other brochures etc.Cons - no fault of the hotel but location is near the churches and bells ring. Especially if you want a rest in late afternoon. Shops in area open shutters around 7.30am. otherwise not as noisy as we thought as it is just far enough from the Ramblas to avoid the noise on the main road. Having said that it is only 20meters away but round a corner. I would definetly recommend it and go there again. Liceu metro stop (green line)is only 30 metres away. Boquira market is across the street once you get on the Ramblas. PS. Do make a point of visiting the Magic fountain at Place Espanya. It is a fantastic free show.

<Content>A little attention to detail would have made it so much better Great location just off the Ramblas. It is close to loads of restaurants, tourist info and metro station. The hotel is new so it is very clean but has been let down by the small details. It seems like it was finished in a rush. They have synthetic towels, the cover was still on the fire alarm in our room (which was a bit of a worry), there was no light globe in one of the bedside lamps, there were glue marks on the front of the toilet. Noise is also a bit of a problem - there are three church's around the hotel that ring there bells every hour and the nearby shops roller doors are noisy late at night. Better qualilty windows/double glazing would have fixed this.

<Content>Fabulous Location, Fabulous Hotel When I booked the hotel I was worried a little since I didnt get any reviews on it as its new.But when we arrived it was everything we asked for. The room we had was clean and spacious. The bathroom was big. We had got a cheap rate on it and its a three star hotel.Location is just perfect, just off the La rambla so walking everywhere was easy to find. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.I would stay there again if and when I go back to Barcelona. Such a great city.Lots to do and the hotel just made it perfect for us.
