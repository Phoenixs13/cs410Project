<Content>The last of the greats. I have been coming to the Hawaiiana for the past 20 years. My parents even longer. It has not changed since my first visit, which is what keeps us coming back. Upon entering the Hawaiiana you are in your own amazing tropical world, unaware that the hussle and bussle of the main street is less then a block away. The Hawaiiana gives you a glimpse of what Oahu once was. Every year we see the same faces and are greeted as old friends, always being welcomed home. What a shame that we now have a view of the ugly Trump Tower from the pool area. We recently vacationed with our 4 year old grandson, who is also hooked. I only hope that the Hawaiiana will survive all the changes on the block so that my grandson will have fond memories of the Hawaiiana long into his adult years. We all agree if we loose the Hawaiiana we will not be back to Oahu.

<Content>Dont go here, especially if you are military I find it mildly ridiculous that when you check into a hotel that you are asked for your bosses name and phone number, but the military does have a bad reputation so I obliged. Unfortunately for me I found out why, after my friends (who also had a room in the hotel) knocked two outside lawn chairs into the pool and didn鈥檛 retrieve them. I understand that this was unacceptable behavior, but the response from the staff was a little excessive. Not only did they take my friends 200 dollar security deposit claiming that the chairs were 200 dollars apiece but also took mine. When we protested the fact that they were taking 400 dollars for two outside chairs from walmart that spend all day in the scorching hawaiian sun the owner blackmailed us by threatening us with calling our commanding officer. There was nothing we could do because of the way the military handles all public relations incidents. So in summary be careful, the hotel isnt that great and if they decide to take your deposit (which they can do at any time), it turns a great deal into what you could be paying for a much nicer place.

<Content>The way it used to be My parents and my inlaws had both been regulars at the Hawaiiana and recommended it highly. After a long long flight, when we arrived at the Hawaiiana, I was worn out and looking at the room, I quite honestly wondered what we had gotten ourselves into. The room was typically 50's motel-like with cinderblock walls and spartan appearance.It didn't take us long to see what we had missed earlier. The louvered walls of the room opened into a very pretty garden/pool area. The sea breeze came through the room when the louvers were opened, and the AC was unnecessary. The whole atmosphere was like a trip back in time to when local places with character, friendliness and charm were the norm and the blandness of the big chains hadn't yet killed everything.It was sad seeing that construction was killing off what is left of old Waikiki, but thankfully the Hawaiiana and a few others are still there. What a loss it will be when these last few old school places are finally displaced by the Trump Towers and other such atrocities.At any rate, I'm glad I got to stay at the Hawaiiana while I still had the chance. Next trip to the islands, I hope I can do it again. Give me a place with some character over the big chains any day!

<Content>Very good location, just keep your expectations in check First, I must say the hotel is in a very good location. It is only a block off Waikiki Beach and the Halekulani hotel. Second, the grounds of the hotel are kept very nice and inviting - the hotel staff were very polite and accommodating -no problems there.The hotel room was $159 per night, including tax, so we knew it wasn't going to be the greatest room we ever stayed in. Our rooms was on the ground floor right at the pool - probably the best location you could get. But the room was disappointing - really. The walls are cement block - very cold - felt like a prison (sorry). The bathroom was horrific (again, sorry), but it was. There was mold and the sink was so rotted I wanted to run to the local Home Depot and just buy a new one. I also wanted to buy a bottle of bleach and immerse the bathroom in it from floor to ceiling. It was not a comfortable room or clean room at all.I do have to say that if you are on a budget or if you aren't going to stay in the room at all (which was our case), then fine. Just keep your expectations in check.

<Content>Extremely dissatisfied with accomodations I was very unhappy with my stay at Hawaiiana. The room was dark and dreary and stale smelling. The air conditioning ran constantly. It was probably very nice in 1950.

<Content>Just LOVE this peaceful gem! This little gem is so relaxing...it has kept the peaceful tranquility that you can't find it the larger hotels. THIS little place is what you go to Hawaii for...to relax :) We are repeat guests, and are amazed to always run into repeat guests on each of our stays, as once you find the Hawaiiana, you find peaceful Hawaii at it's best.Also, good to note, as with ALL hotels in Hawaii, you can book a budget room or an excellent room, and you get what you pay for. The Hawaiiana offers BOTH, so you decide what you want, then ask for that when booking, and that is what you should expect, excellent or budget. People writing poor reviews are usually booking budget rooms, so they should expect that...people writing excellent reviews paid a little more and got more than they expected. We always book the better rooms, and have always been more than pleased.

<Content>Hated the Hawaiiana The room was horribly dingy, the carpet filthy, and the towels threadbare. The entire area surrounding us was under construction and noisy not to mention the dust. We were not given a room with a balcony so all we had was a window obscured by tropical plants. Our window had wooden slats leaving us to wonder what might be crawling around in all those jungle plants not to mention that daylight did not reach into the room. Never, ever would I recommend this hotel.

<Content>What a surprise! After booking the hotel and thinking I scored due to the low $89.00 a night price (last minute and in July), I was horrified to read the reviews on this site about how bad the hotel was. Having no other option since I waited until the last minute, my sister and I traveled to Honolulu and prepared for the worst. When we arrived, the hotel was small but charming, the garden atmosphere was beautiful and the hotel was alive with guests from all over the world lounging around the proptery. Happy, we headed to our standard room which was at the back of the hotel. Bad decision. We entered the room and were shocked. Our view was of a brick wall and the janitor's closet and the decor was horrific. We were right next to the road and it was totally noisy. My sister started to cry (since she only stays in 5 star resorts). So, we went back to the front desk and upgraded to a garden/pool view room on the third floor for only $110.00 a night. Totally worth it!! The room was clean and while the bathroom was very 1970's, it is super clean and HUGE!!! The bed was comfy and the view was nice. We had a large lanai that overlooked the pool. We stayed for 6 nights and had a great time. You can't beat the location (across from an ABC store; 3 minute walk to the beach, Starbucks and Jamba Juice; and just south of Kalakaua), the hotel staff rocked and so did the cable tv options! You can walk right out of your room and be in the elements which feels great. I loved this hotel. It has more charm and interaction then a mega resort (I've stayed in plenty) and the diversity of guests was refreshing! Most were from Japan. I would totally stay at the Hawaiiana hotel again, but only in a Garden View room or better!!! Do not book a standard room!!!

<Content>The WORST Hotel we've ever sayed at. This place was awful! Broken down beds,flat pillows older than me. 2 threadbare towels the size of washcloths.broken tv,bugs,air conditioner in window loud and didn't work, carpet dirty and disgusting. windows that didn't close. It was so gross, we left in the middle of the night to spend the rest of the night in our rental car. If we hadn't already paid in full, we would have left the minute we walked into the room. We now call it the Hawaiana Hotel from Hell!

<Content>The garden is great but thats it I arrived at this hotel January 1 2006 and spent 5 nights. My first mistake was staying in a standard room. The acoustics were terrible. The first night I was woken up at 7:30 AM by a family of keen early risers talking below my window, and it was like they were talking in my room I could hear every word of their conversation. I asked to be moved to another standard room, but this one was right next to the noisiest street in Waikiki, Saratoga. I thought these rooms were just smaller, but the attendant advised me all the standard rooms arein fact the VERY noisy ones either facing Saratoga street or with no sound buffer (balcony) from chatter in the courtyard.They then offered to move me to a superior room which was nuch quieter, except the shower leaked and I couldn't get it to stop. The rooms themselves were very meagre, they give you 2 TINY towels.In general the false advertising turned me off, they should just rename all the standard rooms to noisy rooms. Also staying there in the summer when you HAVE to use air conditioning would be a problem they only have noisy kind.The last 12 days of my trip I stayed at Waikiki Joy, MUCH nicer, quiet new hotel for the same price.

<Content>Our Favourite Hotel In The World wE HAVE been staying at the Hawaiana Hotel for many years. My husband and I have stayed by ourselves, with our daughter and grandson and with our son and daughter...all on different trips. In 2003 we brought our l7 year old grandson with us and although it rained quite a bit that year we still enjoyed the hotel...with the lawn, the coffee shack, the pool and the friendly guests. Its close proximity to stores, the Beach, and bus service makes it ideal for vacationing. The staff are just wonderful. It is quiet and very peaceful. The best part is that you dont have to take an elevator to the 24th floor to have a nice view. When you are sitting poolside at the hawaiana Hotel you forget there is a bustling busy world just a few steps away. The rooms are not luxurious but access to the pool, the lawn and your own barbecue make up for that. Thank you Hawaiana for continued Aloha spirit to all your vacationers.

<Content>Hawaiian Hospitality ... but not much else We stayed for two weeks in December of last year, on the recommendation of an older relative who lives in Waikiki. He wanted us to experience Hawaiian hospitality, rather than stay at a high-rise chain. Since he was paying for our stay, we let him book our reservation--after he had checked out the place and assured us that we'd like it.Our second-floor, walk-up (with two weeks worth of luggage!) room had a garden view balcony, which was nice. However, the handle on the sliding door was so loose that it was really hard to slide and lock it at night. To the staff's credit, they did get that fixed the same day we brought it to their attention.Room was small, but adequate. The window A/C was old and noisy. (In a way, that was good, because it helped block out the noise of traffic.) Beds weren't great, but not the worst I've slept on, either.No internet access, so we used the phone for dial-up service through AOL--and got charged for each local call. There was no Do Not Disturb sign, so we had to make our own to put up when we didn't want service.Speaking of the service, it didn't seem like they thoroughly cleaned the bathroom at all during our entire stay. One day we even put all our toiletries, etc, in the closet--just so there wouldn't be the excuse that they couldn't clean around our stuff. Sink and top of toilet tank were still dirty when we returned, even though towels had been replaced.The front desk staff were very nice and helpful, so we did get to experience Hawaiian hospitality. And the location is great; we were able to walk almost everywhere we needed to go. But if we go back to Waikiki, we'll probably stay in a newer, cleaner place with central A/C and internet access, etc.

<Content>The ambiance of the true Hawaii My wife and I have been staying at the Hawaiiana with our friends for over ten years. We will continue to return as long as our health allows. We see many of the same people from around North America every year and have become friends with many of them.The Hawaiiana is what Hawaii is about, we can stay in a chain hotel anywhere and they are all similar. There are few establishments like the Hawaiiana remaining. The staff and the ambiance call us back every year.

<Content>Don't Be Fooled... The thing that makes me the most made about our stay at this hotel is that if our local friends would have called us back when we first contacted them (and we had not waited for them to call), we could be staying at a higher-end hotel instead of this dump. Our advice鈥攂ook early and you can get special room rates at hotels light years nicer than this place. We didn鈥檛 mind that it is dated, sure, there is charm to that. What we did mind were the horrible broken down beds, dirty carpets, locker room towels, the mildew in the bathroom (which only had a shower 鈥?nice to know when you are already there with a small child, have no bath, and hope they don鈥檛 touch anything that鈥檚 growing on the walls). Oh, the peeling paint, rusted fixtures, power surges, rooms that don鈥檛 seal well due to their old style screened in fronts. It must have been a cute design when it opened in the early 60鈥檚, but forty years later it lets light, dust, and noise in. Did we mention the air-conditioner was loud as all get-out. Ok, just to be fair 鈥?it is well located, the staff was nice and helpful, the out-door foliage was pretty, and the fridge worked鈥?.but all in all the place was a dump鈥?beware!

<Content>Ambivalent about the Hawaiiana My grown daughter and I spent a week here. She loved it wholeheartedly. I'm not so sure.We had the cheap standard room at $89/night. The room was well worn, even shabby, but the carpet seemed to be pretty new. I heard $225 quoted for some rooms. Those must have been remodeled.The grounds are lushly planted. You can always get a lounger by the pools.If you are not in line when they serve the juice and pastry in the morning, you will not get any.The busy hum of Waikiki, along with the construction on Lewers St. and the loud air conditioner made the room quite noisy.The TV channel lineup is the best I've ever had.The location is convenient for everything. You can be on the beach in just a few minutes.I will go back. I highly recommend this place to people who are not too picky about the room condition.

<Content>sucked Staff was stupid, didnt know what she was doing. Almost got gunned down, early in the morning we heard gun shots we had to leave it was very scary.parking was too far. Almost fell off the stairs because the lighting was terrible. The Room that we stayed at was very hot, the AC wasnt even on and there was no curtains to block our privacy. I will never ever book at this hotel.

<Content>tons of construction nearby i stayed here for only two nights and it was fine, but not great. i got upgraded to a deluxe room, which was nice of them, but it really wasn't all that special. the staff was nice and helpful and the location was great for getting around and close to everything on waikiki. the only real issue was that there was a TON of construction going on, both directly next door and across the street just a bit over and it was defintiely loud during the day.

<Content>Mixed feelings - dingy but charming Very worn Motel 6-like hotel in excellent location with charming grounds. We were there 7/3/05-7/6/05. :-( Room was nothing special. We all had standard rooms on the first floor (Hau building), the least expensive. Beds were not very comfortable, but they weren鈥檛 the worst I鈥檝e slept on. The room was somewhat clean (the remote control was literally crusty), but the bathroom needed a thorough, not just cursory cleaning that it鈥檚 apparently been getting. The grout was stained and icky in the shower and on the sink, and I tried not to walk barefoot on the bathroom floor, which seemed grimy. Room was dark, unless we open the louvered blinds on the windows and doors, which allowed people to see in. Decor was reminiscent of a cheap motel, but that wasn鈥檛 too important to me. The cleanliness and comfort factors were the biggies. :-) Kitchenette was handy. Dishes were useful, and we used the fridge, but we didn鈥檛 do a whole lot of cooking, after having spent 5 days in Maui in a beautiful condo (Kapalua Villas), where we ate in a lot. Stored some food in the microwave, for fear of bugs--didn鈥檛 see any, however. There was half a pineapple in the fridge for us when we got there鈥攏ice touch, but attention is needed in other areas! :-) Location is excellent, about 1 block from the beach. Lots of good restaurants around鈥攚e loved the sushi place, Sushikou, across the street, and the Arancino had good pizza, although the service was a little lacking. Lots of nearby shopping, from the ABC Store across the street (convenience store featuring lots of kitschy souvenirs) to the upscale stores around the corner (Tiffany, Chanel, etc.). Also next to the post office and the Army museum, which my husband enjoyed. We found a nice Internet cafe (-) a handful of blocks away, $1 for 10 minutes. (There were a couple closer, but we really liked the atmosphere here). There really was so much within walking distance! :-) Grounds are nice鈥攖wo small pools and lots of vegetation, quite lovely. Not too many people in the pools when we went, which was pleasant.:-) Staff were nice, particularly Thomas, who recommended restaurants, places to go and called Pearl Harbor to see if it would be open on July 4 (it was). :-) They provided juice and coffee in the morning (bring your own cup).:-( They said they put danishes out at 7:30 a.m., but there must not have been very many, because they were gone every time we checked immediately after! This irritated my husband particularly. :-| Parking was extra $$, had to park in the lot behind the hotel, across the street.My husband wishes we had spent a few more dollars and stayed somewhere nicer. He would give the Hawaiiana 2 stars at most, and he鈥檚 a pretty seasoned traveler. I have mixed feelings about the Hawaiiana, being a bit more sentimental. The price was right, location was right, the grounds were charming, and it was like stepping back in time. The room itself was just not up to par. It would definitely NOT be the place to go for a romantic honeymoon, but for a budget family vacation (as 鈥渂udget鈥?as Hawaii can be, anyway), it鈥檚 passable. Unless you absolutely need a very comfortable bed and/or can't stand it if your room isn't sparkling clean.

<Content>Hawaiiana Still The Best! Just returned from my annual vacation in Hawaii. Stayed at the Hawaiiana Hotel May 14-June 5th, 2005. Lots of improvements to units. Everything has been painted, recarpeted etc. A favorite oasis amidst the hub bub of Waikiki. Mostly the same people return here year after year after year, and we all LOVE it. The management and staff are all like family. The units are well furnished and clean. Convenient to buses, beach, shopping and entertainment. I highly recommend it. JAustin@281.comMarble Falls, TX

<Content>A local gem The Hawaiiana Hotel is a unique low-rise hidden gem in the midst of high-rise Waikiki. Excellent location 3 blocks from the beach near Fort deRussy park on Beach Walk. A variety of rooms in 4 buildings set around lush gardens and two pools. All rooms have basic equipped kitchenettes. Complimentary Kona coffee and juice served each morning in the courtyard. Ice machine and coin washer  dryers. Habachi set ups available for $4 per use. Some paid parking available on Saratoga.Please note, this is not a fancy place, or a resort by any stretch, more reminisant of a California apartment complex in the 60's. Some rooms are much nicer than others (light and airiness or with balconies). Check the room locator map on the website and do avoid the ground floor 1-bedroom suites (dark).

<Content>Hawaiiana - nice. My friend and I stayed at the Hawaiiana from 10/20/04-10/24/04 in one of their budget rooms. The room was adequate but the kitchenette, amenities, staff and location were key. I loved the morning coffee and juice and the foliage in the courtyards. Next time I would pay the extra money and stay in one of the garden view rooms.

<Content>Hawaiiana, the best place I have stayed My family and I have stayed at the Hawaiiana hotel 6 times now, and we will be staying there for our 7th time this coming Christmas. We love the atmosphere of this hotel, and we wouldn't stay anywhere else. We have stayed in high rise hotels before, but I think you get to experience Hawaii better in an almost ground floor hotel. I love how the hotel is right off the street, but because of all the plants, you wouldn't know it. There are 2 swimming pools, and there is juice served by the pool in the back in the mornings. What more could you ask for?

<Content>Thumbs Up For The Hawaiiana We stayed here for a week back in December of 1997 and enjoyed our stay. We had their cheapest room which had us located towards the back of the property, but our ground level lanai was directly in front of one of the two pools the Hawaiiana features. And since we had a rental car, it also placed us about 20 steps from the limited parking spaces they have. I do mean limited as in 5 measly slots for a motel that probably sports 30 or 40 rooms. The grounds were lushly landscaped and at night the tiki torches were lit - very aesthetically pleasing. The building which our room was located in was built of cinderblock and the windows and louvers were wood. The AC was spotty as I recall, but the tradewinds are usually enough to suffice. Our kichenette had microwave and fridge. We made many of our own meals and saved $$ that way. The staff was friendly and there was an Aloha feel throughout. We would recommend, even tho it seemed the rear buildings could have used a facelift.

<Content>Disappointed I just returned from 6 nights at the Hawaiiana and have mixed reviews about the hotel.There is no doubt that the lobby, courtyards and pool areas are above average and well worth the stay...exactly what I was looking for !The rooms however...another story. I was not only disappointed, but totally disgusted, with my room.The room was old, run down, dark and dingy. It smelled like mildew and the kitchenette' was nothing short of revolting...I never used it. Absolutely hated the room and spent as little time in it as possible...choosing to walk around town at night alone rather than be in there.It does look like the new management is sprucing the place up...they are renovating many of the rooms. The rooms across the courtyard all had large windows and french doors...which would cut out the dark, dingy part of my old room. Hopefully they will be updating all of the rooms.One thing to note as well is that many of the rooms do NOT have a lanai. ( or a bathtub )If you want a quiet retreat from the city...then the peaceful courtyards and pools at the Hawaiiana cant be beat. There was no better place to be during the day or in the evening.I would stay here again...BUT only if I was assured one of the upgraded rooms on the second or third floor...with a lanai. There is no way I would ever stay in one of their old rooms again.Make sure to specify that you will only take one of the renovated rooms when you book !The location is excellent....only a block from the beach and a very short walk to the bustle of Waikiki...on a relatively quiet street.Another note....this is a quiet, peaceful old hotel and as such, there is no noice at all tolerated after 9 PM. If you want quiet, it is great...if you expect to go to party at night...stay elsewhere. If you expect Five star service and rooms...don't bother.

<Content>Location and Atmosphere We stayed here many years ago in 1996 after reading about the Hawaiiana in the Frommers Guidebook. We were enchanted with the place. The location was perfect. The atmosphere was tropical with the gardens, tikis out the front and low rise buildings. We found it a great alternative to the high rise hotels.We're considering another vacation to Hawaii at the end of the year and will stay here when in Oahu.

<Content>Budget hotel Response service to room enquiry excellent. Was offered better deal without prompting. Rooms need redecorating, looking tired, kitchen equipment old. No kettle or hot water jug. Limited TV access. Security feels weak. Access from street not secure and rooms have frail chains. Safe available for rental. Air conditioning noisy. Small but tranquil garden pool. Excellent street location to downtown shopping. House service polite and efficient. ABC store close by for grocery items. If you don't mind the rather stale interior decor, this hotel reflects well as good value for the money.
