<Content>Fantastic for families We stayed here for three days during Spring Break and I can't tell you how impressed we were. All the problems mentioned in earlier posts have been dealt with - all the rooms are being renovated, the back parking lot has bright floodlights and the breakfast is substantial and free. We have traveled extensively and usually stay at Hyatt's, and the interior is on par with most Hyatts we have been to. We booked a 2 bedroom suite which was the size of a small apartment with a kitchen with granite countertops, and 2 bathrooms. There were 3 flat screen TV's and an ethernet line. There was a full breakfast in the morning and an evening social hour with basic, but filling fare (grilled chicken sandwiches, chili dogs) which changes every day. There was also a self serve wine and beer bar. Staff was wonderful and friendly. Some have alluded to the fact that it is not in a great area - well, this is true insomuch as it is right off the highway and it is in a business area with gas stations and repair shops as its neighbors, but for the price, what do you expect? We have small children and we felt completely safe here, even at night. The doors are to an exterior, outside hallway, but again, we felt very safe. The only other issue is that it is still under renovation and even thought the unit next to us was being worked on, I can honestly say we didn't hear one bit of construction noise. The courtyard has a small but clean pool and whirlpool and a basketball half court. The lobby had fresh cookies and coffee available all day. The fitness center had fresh fruit, water and towels and 3 pieces of high end Life Fitness work out machines each with its own TV as well as weights. I would say this has to be one of the best places we have ever stayed if you look at value for your money. We would not stay any where else in Dallas!

<Content>Protect Your Vehicle My wife and I stayed there the weekend of the Dallas vs. New England game. The Hotel was clean, the staff was wonderful, and the area around the hotel is the problem. Know I see why this hotel has security; my passenger side window was busted. There are not any houses around this hotel, but one staff member told me there is a homeless shelter down the street! The hotels refuse to pay for any of the repair for the vehicle. Make sure you read the signs around the hotel; according to Denise Lennox, the signs stat the hotel is not responsible for any third party damages! The parking is very dark around the back of the hotel, try to park in front or find another hotel. Staff also told me this was the third time within the week this has happen. BE CAREFUL THIS IS YOUR VEHICLE; THEY WILL NOT PAY YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES!

<Content>Good We stayed here to catch an early flight out of Lovefield. The staff was friendly and the suite we stayed in was nice. It is an old building and it shows but for the price we paid we are not complaining. The breakfast was the norm, nothing special. Will stay here for the location.

<Content>Two thumbs DOWN, from a Marriott SILVER Rewards Member This is an older hotel which must have been a remodeled former hotel of another brand, and borders a very suspect part of town (I had my tailgate stolen in broad daylight from the nearby Sheraton Brookhollow). The layout is very peculiar, with exterior (outside) entrances to many rooms. These exterior entrances allowed unobserved access to guest rooms, which is a very poor security risk in this area - a total stranger could walk directly up to my door. Additionally, the layout allows for several unlit potential hiding places for criminal activity. When I arrived to check in, I noticed several rather unsavory-looking characters loitering in the area. I always stay at Marriott, typically Residence Inn for the value and comfort. This is definitely the worst of at least 15 Residence Inns I'm familiar with. My room does not have basic silverware. I'm sure I could get some if I called the front desk, but I shouldn't have to. My neighbors are in an out of their room continually, and my whole room shudders as their door slams. The kitchen is tiny, with a two-burner electric range, instead of the typical four burners. If you need an extended stay hotel near the medical facilities, and take into account the security concerns, this place may serve you well. As for me, I'd rather try a Fort Worth Motel 6 before I stay here again.

<Content>Be Prepared to Move I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks while my daughter was having surgery, and stayed in the hospital. During the course of 2 weeks, we had to switch rooms 4 times. When we checked in we asked to be near the lobby and the pool, we got put in this dark dingy hole of a room that required walking through the parking lot to gert to the pool or front desk, not very good for our 2 young children. They moved us to a different room which wasn't much better, the toilet wouldn't flush and we kept having problems with the plumbing. When we moved again, they put us in a room in the gatehouse, the room was nicer, but once again we had plumbing problems, they tried fixing it, but we ended up getting flooded out. They moved us to another room in the gatehouse, and we ended our stay without any more problems. The service is bad in this hotel, the front desk clerks are often watching TV, and when we checked in and asked for foam pillows instead of the down pillows, it took us 3 hours to get them. This hotel needs lots of work if it ever wants to live up to it's name.

<Content>Need Improved Customer Service I chose this hotel because of the low medical rate. I am working in the area and will be for some time. The cleanliness still needs to be worked on. The carpets are older and need vacummed. I have called on several occasions to try and get a room. Many times, even after 8PM, they put you on hold forever. Once I was put on hold for several minutes (long distance) and then told that they would take my number and call me back. They never did. There needs to be management in place to check the cleanliness of the rooms from a customer vantage point, and someone there to show the help what customer service should be like. Really needs major cleanup and change.
