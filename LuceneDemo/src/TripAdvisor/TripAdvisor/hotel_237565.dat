<Content>Just what you need in Amsterdam A group of 10 of us stayed here in a quad and 2 triple rooms with private facilities. Absolutely no trouble at all. Rooms were clean, staff friendly and breakfast was not bad for continental. Anyone writing bad reviews for this hotel must have very high standards. What you have to remember is that it is 2 star. Afterall you get what you pay for and at 55 euros per person per night I have no complaints at all. Hotel is about 10 mins walk from most major sight seeing areas and is far enough away from the lively areas that the bars around it are about half the price of those in the very centre. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Really enjoyed our hotel stay We rented the apartment rooms with another family and had a very nice three days in Amsterdam. We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel and it was so easy to walk everywhere or catch the tram. After 3 days in a very noisy Paris, this was a much needed stay on an extremely quiet street. Our family enjoyed breakfast and talking to Robert about his jukebox, as well as his feisty dog. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who will be visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Basil Fawlty 'lives' Carmel  Ronan, Ireland. can't believe the reviews i've been reading about this glorified BB trading as a hotel. Do some people like being ignored or treated like naughty schoolkids by their host? How can I sum up our host, first, Basil Fawlty was rude but funny, guess which one we missed out on, second, if you want to display your record collection in the 'dining area' then don't be surprised if people take a look them! We didn't, maybe that was because of the warning signs. Third, last weeks bread does not taste any better for being burnt at the communal toaster. I could go on, but this place was the pits, loved Amsterdam, but hated this dump.

<Content>a warm,friendly and unique experience I have just spend 3 days at the DE MUNCK hotel in Amsterdam.I can highly reccomend the hotel as it is good value for money. The manager , Robert , was always ready to help with any questions we had ranging from what to do, how to get there and where to eat.The Hotel is centrally situated in a central alley alongside a picturesque canal filled with house boats. From here its 10 minutes to most of the main squares, museums and fine restaurants. The heinekan factory is almost on the doorstep, so its easy to walk back to after your 3 free beers at the factory.The room was large, I mean large and even had a leather 3 piece sofa. Breakfast was fresh tasty and filling. We managed to get to dinner without being hungry.all in all - go there with an easy mind. You will not regret it.Mike

<Content>He's a character Stayed at De Munck twice, in '99 and '01. The proprietor, Rob, has that sardonic Dutch humor, but if you find him funny he warms up quickly. The first thing he told us was that his dog hates Americans and might bite us, which was a terrible lie. A couple of cats had the run of the dining room as well, which made it feel very homey to us.The rooms were comfortable, and, as mentioned elsewhere, different from each other. The stairs are very steep and a bit scary if you aren't steady on your feet, so the De Munck is probably not a good choice for older travelers. One of our party slipped and went all the way down to the next landing before stopping. It might have ruined the trip for someone less sturdy.Breakfast was pretty basic, but it was a nice touch, a fun way to meet the other guests, and got us through to lunch easily.I suspect the key to whether you're going to enjoy De Munck is whether or not you get along with Rob...or maybe, whether he gets along with you. He's got a prime location, so he doesn't need to be any nicer than he wants to to keep the place full. If he wants you to come back, you'll know it. We'll be making reservations the next time we're headed for Amsterdam.

<Content>A word of caution We had a reservation for 2 nights. It turns out they overbooked. We were given a room in a neighboring hotel the first night. It was not worth the money. The bathroom had leaks everywhere and was a complete mess. We had to move to another location about 0.5 mile away for the 2nd night. That room was quite nice. But we could not avail of the breakfast that is included because we had an early morning train to catch and Hotel de Munck was not on our way.Overall, it was a disappointing experience. It was not worth the money and was very inconvenient. The owner did not admit to overbooking or apologize for the inconvenience.

<Content>Beware de Munck We stayed at Hotel de Munck in July 2005. We were there with a group of friends, and everyone we were with was unsatisfied with the hotel. We nicknamed it Hotel de Junk after the first night. The entire atmosphere was unprofessional and it felt much more like a bare-bones hostel than a hotel--which is fine, but it cost 100 euros per night. The man who runs the place was rude to everyone, including his wife. They did not deliver phone messages. The airline misplaced my suitcase and when they called to deliver it the man told them they could not as he would not be there to accept it. I had to wait an extra day to get the bag and he never left a message that they called. I requested an iron upon check-in and he yelled at me that he did not have one. Although later he brought one, it was too late to iron my clothes. There was no soap or shampoo in the rooms. The owner made nasty comments to my friend when she requested soap. Another friend requested that they turn the heat on in her room- it was in the 60s all weekend. He told her she needed to see a doctor if she was cold. We were woken up daily by the man yelling at his wife--he was NOT charming. The room overall was fine, but old furnishings and bathroom made it all seem dirty. Another thing- upon checkout they demand cash, but when I got home they charged my credit card 10 euros. When I emailed to ask what the 10 euros were for, they did not reply. I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great small hotel My wife and I had a very nice stay here in February. I think we got a bargain off-season rate. The accomodations (in the adjacent doorway, right next to the hotel) were clean and pleasant. The owner/manager was helpful, and breakfast was good if a bit crowded at certain times. The location is very good -- half a block from major tram lines, and many restaurants (from vegetarian to Tibetan) around the corner on Uterecht street.

<Content>what a surprise! I did not expect to find such a cosy atmosfere and good music! bravo for the owner mr Eggens. Very charming small hotel with it's own style. Clean, organized, good price and good breakfast - uff! I've eaten too much! I like to come back to that place and I will. I shall always identify Amsterdam with that hotel... Agnes

<Content>Convenient and comfortable We stayed overnight at Hotel de Munck and would definitely stay there again. It's hard to find family room-type accommodation in Europe and the price was good at EUR 160. Also, it felt quite homely. The four of us were in a large family room on the first floor overlooking the street and the nearby canal and the front door to the hotel. (I thought there might be a lot of noise but it was fine.) The room was nothing special but its size certainly helped and it was warm without being stuffy - not bad in late autumn. Power sockets already had an adaptor which was great. Coffee and hot chocolate were readily available courtesy of Rob, the manager, who was very personable and helpful. By the way, he looked at our passports but didn't keep them! I only have three little things to mention to prospective guests: it is an old building so, yes, stairs are steep and narrow. There are no non-smoking rooms but windows can be opened. I had forgotton about the need to pay in cash so that entailed a dash to the nearest ATM which is basically a block away - I would have appreciated a reminder about the cash payment on check-in. These are all relatively minor things, and we had a great 24 hours. Utrechtstraat, five mins away, has great choice of restaurants - try Suizer, the Swiss restaurant, for fabulous comfort food on a winter's night.

<Content>Great family-friendly hotel in perfect location! This was the perfect hotel for us and our three children (ages 16, 12 and 9)! We had a large room (No. 3) overlooking the garden, with five single beds - a hard find anywhere in Europe - at a cost of 190 euros/night (included breakfast). We had a good sized bathroom with toilet, sink and shower. The room and bath were immaculate. The room also had a TV, hairdryer and mini-bar (the mini-bar was empty which suited us well as we stored our water and juices in it). Lots of fluffy white towels, soap and shampoo. The location couldn't be better...a lovely quiet area across the street from a park, complete with sidewalk trampolines which we couldn't tear our 9 yr old away from, and only a few blocks away from shops and restaurants. The owners were very friendly and helpful and served a great breakfast including juice, sweetbreads, sliced meat, cheese, cereals, boiled eggs, bread for toasting, a large pot of delicious coffee, and hot chocolate for the kids. Check out the pictures at ------------------------------------especially those of the electic eating area! A great place to stay and very highly recommended.

<Content>I loved the room in the garden Extremely private without any noise or bother from any one else at the hotel. Sorry to hear it was temporary because I would have loved to stay in that room again. The mngt is amazingly friendly and helpful and the atosphere of the dining area is also great- fun and cozy. I recommend this hotel to everyone visiting amsterdam. What a beautiful and quiet block to reside.

<Content>Amazing What a GREAT hotel, plenty of charm and we were given a great room on the third floor, i think it was room number 17 (but i could be worng) The tv worked, the rooms were clean and we had a LARGE bathroom. The breakfast was good (a little different that what i normally eat in the US, but thats why i went to europe to see how others live) The stairs are steeep, and there is no lift, but this is common in europe. The hotel is in a safe neighborhood, and the owners are soo nice and speak perfect english. They were always willing to answer my questions and give me tips.

<Content>Stayed here before and will go back! After three stays (three rooms) we would highly recommend this hotel for a comparatively inexpensive stay convenient for trams to/from the station and just a walk from many places of interest. Quiet, clean and friendly, ample breakfast, -the rooms do vary but you can ask to be moved or query the price so don't hesitate to complain if you aren't happy. Mix of new and old, including a detached garden room (tiny), top floor room with balcony view (cold out of season but with character!) and some refurbished rooms (smart, but like hotel-rooms world-wide). Careful with your passport - they ask you to hand it in during your stay (they lost one of ours for a day!).

<Content>Internet special room Arrived to find our room was in the 'garden'. Turned out it was a temporary sort of building/shed. It was tiny-finding room,not in the way, for 2 carry-on bags was impossible. When I questioned this the mgt was OK. Told me that they would be happy to call around for us to get another room or to change ours on the 4th and last day for a higher charge. This room was posted at E95. I was given an 'internet special' price of E75. I pointed out that it was the same price as their other rooms with private baths. We were changed to a hotel room on the last nite at no additional charge. The breakfast is good with atmospheric surroundings, mgt friendly. Our final room was what I had been expecting from the web photos-old with character.

<Content>Great place, great people I spent 4 days in Amsterdam a few days ago, and I really enjoyed staying in this hotel. The building itself is charming, so are the owners. It is located within the center, on a calm canal and has rooms for 4 people, an interesting feature.

<Content>very nice Very quiet, very clean, and the owner is a very good gentleman. Restaurants/bars/shoppes galoreright around the corner. Bank across the street, with an ATM. Good free breakfast/coffee. 15 minute walk to the Dam Centrum. Far away enough from the Red Light District to be peaceful and quiet. 50 meters from the tram stop. I highly recommend it, for a mid-range hotel. It is close to all the action!Peace, John
