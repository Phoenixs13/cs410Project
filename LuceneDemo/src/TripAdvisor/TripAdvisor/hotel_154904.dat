<Content>VERY small rooms This hotel offers free airport transportation. It has a good restaurant and has spacious grounds. The biggest problem with the hotel is the room size. I get larger rooms with a basic room in NYC! The room decor is very old and the TV choices were poor. I used the internet with little problem and believe it was free. It may have been billed for it but I usually catch those type of charges. The last time I was in Mexico City I stayed at the Airport Camino Real. Given the cost difference between the two, I'll be staying at the Fiesta Inn next time even with the small rooms.

<Content>nothing to write home about My husband and I stayed at the Fiesta Inn for one night when we arrived in Mexico City. After a bit of a detour getting there due to all the construction on the highway, we arrived in the somewhat scary-looking neighborhood. Inside the hotel, things improved a bit. We got a room in the back, across the nice courtyard, on the second floor. It was a decent room, though definitely not as clean as it should've been (a few stray hairs in sheets  tub).There was a decent breakfast buffet with Mexican fare ($). Overall, it was nothing spectacular, but convenient to the airport. I'd give it 2 1/2 - 3 stars.

<Content>Awful Service - Never Stay Here! We had our most horrible hotel experience at Fiesta Inn (and we are very experience travelers). We had an overnight layover in Mexico City and choose this hotel due to its proximity to the airport and that it had shuttle service to the airport. When we got to Mexico City we called the hotel to say we were there and they said they would send the shuttle over. We stood outside at midnight for an hour waiting for the shuttle. During that hour all of the other hotel shuttles came two or three times. We called the hotel twice more during the hour and they kept telling us (lying to us) that the shuttle was on it's way. The hotel is only 5 minutes away. When the shuttle finally arrived and we reached the hotel, the staff was awful! I told them our situation and asked for a discount. I figured it was fair since they made us wait an hour and we were only staying for 5 hours. You can guess they said no, it was against their policy. I guess it is also against their policy鈥?to say sorry for the inconvenience or give any type of empathy. When I told them we didn't want to stay with that kind of service they told us that even if we didn't stay they would charge us for the room (again due to their policy). We ended up staying (as opposed to loosing a 130 bucks), neither of us sleeping well because we were so angry, and left early. I would never ever stay here. There are too many nice places and people to put up with awful service and staff.

<Content>Getting old for the price We wanted something simple for it was just one overnight. But the room had an oder, a moldy old carpet smell. We asked to be put in another room (the staff was not helpful), and it had the same smell. I was not trying to be crazy, for I have stayed in a lot of places, but at over $100/night, I expected more. Ultimately, we took the room, for it was late, then the A/C turned on, which was noisey.We tried to talk to the manager, but he would not come out of his office. Any awful hotel, and I would never recommond it.

<Content>Perfect entry into Mexico for lone female traveller I don't know about the other people here, but I LOVED the Fiesta Inn Aeropuerto!!! I flew to Mexico City alone to go to a 2 week language school in Cuernavaca. I wanted to spend my first night in a hotel before moving on to stay with a family for two weeks. I felt I needed the extra time to adjust to being in Mexico and get oriented. I had never been to Mexico before.The Fiesta Inn Aeropuerto shuttle was a welcome sight, as I had heard that some taxis can be dangerous. When I arrived at the hotelat around 11 pm, staff helped me with my luggage. The mood in the lobby was exciting and festive; some sort of jazz was eminating from the hotel lounge, and there was much activity around. My room was quiet, clean and adequate; it was your typical American style hotel room. It had everything I needed to feel comfortable. The hotel restaurant has a buffet for all 3 meals. Yes, it is more expensive than eating from a street vendor, but it is very nice after a day of flying to be able to fill your plate yourself with a whole bunch of stuff, from salads and fruits, to Mexican specialities, to more familiar fare. I enjoyed my stay so much that I arranged to stay here my last night in country, in order to avoid stress the next morning on the way to the airport. I highly recommend this place and would stay here again, no problem!!!

<Content>Served its purpose We booked this hotel to save $$ compared to the airport Hilton. The hotel was about as expected. Perfect for what we needed, a one night stand. On arrival we found the shuttle with little problem, and the next day the driver dropped us off very near the departing bus to Puebla. If we had to do it over gain, we would return.

<Content>Will NEVER stay again I stayed at this hotel two times due overnight flights. It was simply terrible. I made a reservation three weeks in advance for a single non-smoking room and they gave me a double smoking one. It was 11:30pm after a long trip. I asked to be moved to the room I reserved and the receptionist told me that they were fully booked and I had no other option. I was so tired that I decided to stay that night as my flight would depart at 7am and I needed a nap urgently.When checking out I requested again a single non-smoking room for my next stay that would be three nights later. I asked the receptionist to write down my request to ensure that there was no mistake . She apologized for the inconvenience and confirmed me that my room will be ready at my arrival.I arrived even more tired than before, it was past midnight and the room I was assigned was not only dirty and stinky, but it was far away and again a double and smoking one. It was so late to change hotel and it took them more than 20 minutes to give me a double, far, not as clean as one desires, but a non-smoking one. I confirmed that my request was written in the reservation note at the reception but they did not care.

<Content>Don't be Conned! Be very careful of the staff of this hotel if you arrive at the Mexico City Airport and are looking for overnight accommodations. The hotel agent (the one holding the Fiesta Inn sign at the airport exit) will quote you a price in writing in order to get you to take their van to the hotel, however once you arrive; the staff won't honor this price. They won鈥檛 even acknowledge that their agent made a mistake鈥?we assume they think you鈥檒l stay and pay a higher room rate. We didn鈥檛 and returned to the airport to find another hotel. Don鈥檛 get caught up in Fiesta Inn鈥檚 con game!!!!

<Content>Watch your valuables We chose this hotel the last night we stayed in Mexico City because of the proximity to the airport. We were charged $180 USD with tax. The prices were outrageous for dinner in the hotel restaurant. It was empty for dinner as there is a Wings Restaurant around the block and it was packed. We were easy targets for someone coming in and stealing my jewellry case which contained costume jewels and some silver bought in Mexico. We arrived in the morning and left our bags unpacked as the taxi driver was waiting to take us out. We were gone for 6 hours and when we came back, my things were missing. Later that evening, we went out to dinner and when we returned, we found a catalog for porn available on the bed. This indicated to me that staff could come and go at will and the theft was an inside job. I did not report anything. It would have been a waste of time, I thought. Staff was distant and uncaring enough when we checked in. Mexico City was a friendly and safe city, but we were warned about unsafe neighborhoods. We did not have any problems, except this last incident. The airport area probably should be avoided, or take valuables with you when you go out or leave in hotel safe.

<Content>F Y I I forgot to mention that the PICTURES posted at the top DO NOT BELONG to the HOTEL AEROPUERTO. The pictures posted are from the hotel FIESTA INN AEROPUERTO (before its remodeling).Confusions may be possible because of the name AEROPUERTO, but this is, on my best, the info of the hotels:HOTEL AEROPUERTO - Boulevard Puerto Aereo 380 (THIS is the one we are talking about)HOTEL JR PLAZA AEROPUERTO - Boulevard Puerto Aereo 390 (this is about $80/$90 per room/night)HOTEL FIESTA INN AEROPUERTO - Boulevard Puerto Aereo 502 (very small rooms between $80/$90)HOTEL CAMINO REAL AEROPUERTO - Puerto Mexico 80 (avg. rate of $150, has changed names many times; you will pay for the name and because is the only hotel with airport; I stayed there when it belonged to a different chain and not a big deal; stay there if you find a supersaver web rate and let me know! )
