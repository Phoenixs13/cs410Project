<Content>Lovely base for our stay. Wasn't sure what to expect from this hotel, but considered ourselves very lucky to stay there! We arrived very late on Friday night and were met with smiling reception staff and plenty of beer at the bar. Staying in Berlin is fantastic due to their wonderful transport system. We found the Aparthotel an der spree a great base for our stay. The meals were excellent, the rooms definitely comfortable and inviting and the free internet was a bonus! We are booking to return next year....loved Berlin and loved this hotel.

<Content>Very nice located hotel with superb staff This hotel has 4 stars but is really a nice 3 star hotel. We had a concert in park Wuhlheide and this hotel is located very close to this park. The rooms are spacious but not very luxurious. There is for example no safe deposit or refrigerator in your room. Our room looked over the lovely river Spree. The breakfast was very good and you could enjoy it inside the nice restaurant or in the garden next to the water. Around the corner of the hotel you can take the 63 or 67 tram to station Schoneweide. From this station you can easily go to the centre of Berlin. It will take you about 45 minutes to get in the town centre. A day ticket (till 3 in the night!) for busses, trams, S bahn and U bahn will only cost you 鈧?5,80 per person. We were very suprised by the very, very friendly and helpfull staff. Especially at night in the bar and at the reception! If you don't want to stay right in the middle of Berlin or you have things to do in or around park Wuhlheide I really can recommend this hotel!
