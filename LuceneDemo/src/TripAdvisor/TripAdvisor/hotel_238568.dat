<Content>Surprising Stairs - Fab Breakfast! When my friends and I arrived at PC Hooft Hotel we were rather impressed at its location (it's on a rather plush street near the museums/galleries). However, we were not prepared at all for the very steep staircase which seemed to go on and on. Luckily we were only there for a few nights so we only had little cases to drag up the stairs! The room I stayed in had a small window which I kept permanently open due to the room STINKING of cigarettes! I sprayed alot of my perfume to mask the odour. There was a communal shower which wasn't too clean. The positive side was the staff were friendly and 'laid-back' (well this is Amsterdam if you know what I mean). The breakfast was very good, we helped ourselves to a mighty amount it too! My recommendation is that this is a very niche Hotel, in other words if you a) have Back Problems/Disabilities b) are put off by smoke smells c) are older than 30 then this hotel IS NOT FOR YOU!

<Content>Do. Not. Stay. at. This. Hotel. I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. We arrived and were shown to a basement room (after being told there were no other rooms available at all by the less than understanding receptionist) with no window, with maintenance work being loudly carried out in the hallway outside. After complaning, we were miraculoulsy given a top floor room. Had this suddenly become available within the last, literally, 180 seconds?The television was in an awful condition, no ironing board was supplied as we had been told and the room had no air-con. We were next to 2 very inconsiderate travellers, who, due to the thin and ultra NON soundproof walls, kept us awake till at least 4am each and every night.Breakfast was OK, but very basic and in a horrible surrounding. The Vondelpark entrance at the end of the street was fenced off and all in all, my opinion of Amsterdam has been soured by this truly horrific hotel.

<Content>Very Basic We were first shown to a room with no window, so luckily we got changed to a room with a window. The small double rooms are very small, ensuite was clean and recently retiled. Breakfast was good. Very expensive and not a 3 star std hotel. The area was nice and not very far from shops and leidsplein. We paid 546 for 4 nites.

<Content>Not worth the money! We needed a hotel room for an extra night in Amsterdam and our much cheaper one star up the street was totally booked, so we booked this hotel on Expedia. While it was very nice to have our own bathroom, it was absolutely not worth the money. The bed was pretty uncomfortable, the TV was black  white and the elevator smelled terrible. Considering I was able to priceline a 4 star hotel room for substiantally less in another major european city, I really feel that the Hotel Pc was kind of a rip off. Amsterdam is an expensive city to stay in, but with a little work, you could defenitely do better. I should also note that this hotel has a different name on the front, it is called the Hotel City Gardens, not Hotel PC. However, the address matches, so it ended up working out.

<Content>For the price there are better places, though location good. It was OK if the main thing was to have a cheap room in walking distance of the centre - its very near the reijksmuseum and the outer ring of the central canals, and the Vondelpark is lovely. Designer shops alll along the road if you like window shopping. And to be fair, the reception staff were nice and friendly and helpful. However, the hotel is dingy and shabby throughout, reception carpet worn through and very worn and faded bedroom furnishings. The lift was tiny and made worrying creaking noises, and our room was a few flights of stairs further up than the lift went, so not for the elderly or infirm. we had an en suite bathroom and the shower worked, but the bathroom was grubby and cracked. Our radiator didnt work, when on it gurgled loudly, when off the room was freezing and the bedding too thin to get warm. We asked for someone to bleed the radiator but there was no evidence of this having been done, and by the time we got back each night we were too tired to worry about it really. The beds were very low and the mattresses inadequate. I didnt see any evidence of mice, but both of us did get a load of bites on our legs which looked like fleabites and took ages to clear up. The breakfast was a standard continental style, plentiful (with a warning not to make sandwiches for your lunch on the wall!) and it was nice that it was included in the deal as often it isnt. definitely not ideal for a romantic weekend, but ok if youre backpacking with friends. though even then, Id say the youth hostel round the corner where I stayed last year was clean and cheap and cheerful if youre with friends, and if youre with your partner/family, I'm probably with the people recommending you try somewhere else...

<Content>Horible The PC Hotel in Amsterdam is an overpriced, small, dank and dingy place that's out in the middle of nowhere. The PC Hotel has horrible business practices, just horrible. There are many places to stay in Amsterdam, dont waste any money on this one.

<Content>Caution I booked two nights in this hotel, and I cancelled after I arrived and had a look at the hotel and room, paying 65 Euros as a penalty. The location of this hotel is in fact, quite close to the museums and to the more chic shopping area. However, this hotel, or motel rather, needs a major renovation. The lift was in bad repair, and the carpeting worn through, even at the lobby. The rooms were, to be kind, fairly rundown as well. The beds and sheets looked clean, though. The receptionist was polite, and professional.If you are looking for a purely budget hotel, this could be the place for you. But between this and Ibis-chain of hotels is a whole world of difference (huge tip towards Ibis). I finally ended up paying just 20 Euros more for a room at Novotel Amsterdam. I would seriously discourage you from staying at this hotel if you're on a romantic holiday.

<Content>Nice...after all :) Well, the thing is we (and we being my girlfriend and I) spent a night in a not ventilated dorm, so the fact that we finally found a double room, due to a tall ship something, adds a lot to my grade of this, after all pleasent place. It's situated in the street of the same name, PC Hooft, which is the most exclusive shoping place in Amsterdam. The guy who works there gave us a triple bed room for the two of us, so it was a nice start. for the price of 26 Euros per person, we got bedbreakfast-not much of it, but for a shorter stay, it will get you through the morning. Well, the worst thing is THEY HAVE MICE!!! So just don't keep your food in your room, and it will be OK. All the best!And the stairs are a sight of their own kind, but not a big problem...

<Content>Pleasant Stay for the Price I stayed here for 2 nights in a 3-person room on the top floor. My first piece of advice: if you hate stairs, don't come here. The walk up to the first floor is almost a straight vertical, especially scary on the way down. Since our room was on the top floor we had two more stories to climb, which is a hike after a long day of walking. Ask for a room without the high windows, since we coudn't even see out of ours without climbing on a chair. The toilet in the hallway is small but clean, though I was a little disappointed by the shower, which was a little grimy (I brought shower shoes). The room itself was nice, and the beds were comfortable. The staff were very friendly and gave us advice on what to see in the city. I would say its best feature is its location, on a very chic shopping street and right next to all the major museums. If you're on a budget, this is a great place to stay.

<Content>A Lovely Clean 1 Star hotel - recommended This is a fabulous Hotel. The location is great, in a quieter part of town. Totally within walking to Muesums, restaurants and town. Although it is serviced by tram too for those who hate walking! The staff are friendly and the rooms very clean. The Breakfast is rolls, eggs, ham, cheese and coffee/tea and all for 拢50 - 拢65 (depending if you want your own bathroom or not.For a 1 star hotel you can't get better!!! Definately recommend this place-----

<Content>Highly recommened for location and cheap price (50 euro double) The PC Hooft had a great location - right by Vondel park and a 5 minute walk from the Leidsplien.Its a one star hotel and there is not elevator and most of the rooms share a bathroom. This might seem like a problem for many Americans who are used to Ramada style accomodations but it is not bad at all.There were separate toilets for men and women and two shower rooms shared between 8 or so rooms on our floor. The bathrooms were clean and I never had to wait for the other guests during my five night stay. Each room had its own sink. The rooms were small but comfortable enough. I don't think the rooms were air conditioned but I am not sure as we were there in April it wasn't necessary.Breakfast is included - it is served until 11 am and included hard boiled eggs, ham  cheese, coffee, tea juice and rolls with jam.All in all my brother and I were very happy with the service and rooms at a cost of 50 Euro a night.

<Content>Cheap  What a friendly place! I have stayed at this hotel three times on my numeorus visits to Amsterdam and have always left wanting to come back. In a superb location just outside the city by the Vondelpark and Rijksmuseum but with excellent walking access to all of the city centre attractions this is far and away one of the better budget options. Ok, the rooms are not luxury and sharing a shower and toilet is a drag but here it is a lot better than many other options. It is also a lovely traditional Dutch building on the most swanky street in Holland! And if your going to complain about climbing stairs while in Amsterdam your obviously a really fun person who knows how to have a good time! Its all part of the experience and if you do get a room on the top floor you should consider yourselves lucky for the free yet breathtaking views of the city. And I have always found the breakfast to be just fine.

<Content>What a dive! This hotel was advertised in Time Out. No mention was made of the fact that you would need a Sherpa to guide you up the practically vertical stairs. Our double room was on the top floor so we had to climb about 45-50 steps up and down. The stench of smoke in the room was appalling. Burning incense and opening the window had no effect. Make sure you sleep with someone you get on with really well as you will be very close to them all night (due to the fact that the bed slopes down from either side into the middle). The breakfast was pretty average for the continent. The toilet was tiny, the paper provided was more smear than wipe. The shower was mouldy and uninviting. We went home tired, dirty and exhausted! The only good thing about it was the fact that it was pretty much within walking distance of the centre of town. All this for 65 euros a night. Try the Ibis instead!
