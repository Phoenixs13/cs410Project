<Content>Excellent Reception Staff! My 84 year old father and I recently stayed 10 days at the NH Hotel Kurfurstendamm. Our initial room was a little small and not very handicap friendly. The staff was kind enough to allow us to switch rooms after 2 days into a handicap room at no charge, which I wanted in the 1st place because my father requires the use of a walker but he originally refused. The handicap room was much roomier with a huge walk-in washroom/shower, good-sized flat screen TV, small fridge, and comfy beds. Our room was cleaned every day and they never failed to refresh our towels. Check-in and check-out time was super schnell. I was very impressed by the reception staff who always smiled with a friendly greeting and were very professional. They seemed to know the answers to your questions before you asked them in German or English. The brunette at the front desk was especially courteous  cute with a sweet guten morgen.Breakfast is a little on the pricey side at 18 Euros per person but on the plus side there is no lineup, the food was all bio, plentiful and delicious-Especially the pancakes. Kudos once again to the staff. The price averaged out to about 87 Euros per night because we ordered early and paid up front. That鈥檚 not bad for a modern 4 star hotel in an excellent safe location close to transit, shopping, and some major sites. You get 5% of your bill back if you join NH World, which you can use towards future stays at the very large NH Hotel chain. I normally don鈥檛 like large corporate chains but this one made me feel at home.

<Content>Good location, great hotel Rooms; clean and modern. Good shower and you can get CNN. The bedding was nice and fluffy and you can't hear train if your room faces the street.Hotel itself; breakfast is good, if a little on the pricey side. Worth doing one morning for the waffles alone. The buffet is extensive, and if you're hungry, you can get your moneys worth.There is no pool but there is a sauna and a steam room, and a couple of running machines. The roof terrace is very good too.Location; excellent. 1 minute walk away from the S-Bahn station. Its also close to the starting stop of the city bus tour. Pretty direct (if a little long) transport to the airport.The weather was fantastic (we were there for the first week in June).There are lots of cool bars in the area, and really good sushi restaurant close-by tooOverall I'd recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good boutique style hptel Just returned from a 2 night stay at the NH Ku'damm. Taxi from Schonefeld was 鈧?7.50, which was worth it as our flight landed after 9pm. The train is much cheaper from the station at the airport and conveniently runs to SavignyPlatz, about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.The Turkish-German male receptionist couldn't find the reservation to begin with and was easily distracted by the telephone, which was irritating and hardly and a good start, nevertheless, our room on the second floor, down the hall from the breakfast salon was clean, spacious and light. Flatscreen TV, large king bed, AC and tea and coffee. The glass door to the shower WC is novel: you certainly need to be close if you stay here!Noise from the S Bahn line was only evident with the window open, although some of the rooms are much closer, overlooking the line.Breakfast was a good selection of hot and cold food served until 11am.The location on Grolmanstrasse is ideal for the Ku'damm and Zoo and with SavignyPlatz just a few metres away there plenty of bars and restaurants around: crossing Savigny and carrying on along the extension to Grolmanstrasse we found several excellent restaurants and ate at Florian, 鈧?06 for 2 with wine.All in all a great place to stay: one very small complaint was that the tea and coffee in the room weren't replenished.

<Content>A weekend in Berlin I was looking for a hotel that gave me great access to the city, transportation and entertainment. The NH did all of these and provided a clean, well appointed room for my stay.The space in the room was more on American standards with a large closet, nice sized bath and spacious bed and office area. Plenty of hangers for clothes and space to keep almost anything. It had a mini bar with a good array of offerings (although we did not sample any of the wares).Downsides to the room were a shortage of pillows (1 per person and both of us were used to sleeping with 2). I'm sure we could have resolved it if we had called the front desk but by the time we got in we were too tired to fuss with it. Also, I traveled with a companion and had been very specific about asking for two beds. There were 2, but they were pushed together and shared a common bedsheet. Fortunately we were both willing to take it in stride and other than an initial bit of embarasment it worked out.The front desk was very helpful and the ladies spoke good English. TheBreakfast buffet was sumptuopus and expensive, but there is a nice garden area to eat in as well as the breakfast room and the great food plus ambiance made it a the breakfast of choice for at least one day.We could get everything we needed within just a short walk, and its proximity to Tegel airport was another plus. I wouod definteluy stay again

<Content>Fantastic Modern Hotel We stayed here for 3 nights  were very impressed with the access, hotel  location. A nice residential street near to a few bars, cafe's and all the main shops on the Ku'damm.Easy cheap access on the trains to East Berlin/ Brandenburg Gate/Checkpoint Charlie etc. Other attractions close by to walk to-Berlin Story/Nuclear bunker tour. Zoo/ Kaiser Wilhelm church.As we had never been to Berlin before we decided at 拢260 for 3 nights this was a decent gamble on a modern 4 star hotel. Glad to say it was worth every penny. I almost booked the Heckers hotel over the road for a lot more!! so am very glad we didn't! I would definitely reccomend the S-bahn if you fly into Schonefeld as the Taxi will set you back at least 35 euros. Get the Spandau line to Savignyplatz, it cost about 2 euros and takes 40 mins. Good views on the train of suurounding areas to East Berlin!The hotel was obviously new, very spacious room- Flat Screen Phillips TV, Well stocked Mini Bar, Good clean bathroom. Only let down in the room was that the double was 2 beds pushed together so make sure you specify a King or double when checking in.Staff were friendly and helpful- especially as the S-Bahn workers went on strike the night before we were due to travel home at 6am the following day. Always worth asking at reception for advice the night before!! All in a great hotel  would definitely go back to Berlin  this hotel!

<Content>Good hotel, but questionable value for money The hotel is in a good location, just off Ku'damm which has all of the shops which you could ever wish for. The hotel looked as if it had been recently renovated and because of this was clean and fresh looking. The staff were friendly and attentive. The room had a flat screen LCD TV and a great shower. The main problem was that my room overlooked the street outside and the S-Bahn runs pretty much right next to the hotel. While it's convenient (about 2 minutes walk from Savingyplatz, which is 1 stop from Zoo Station) you do get quite a lot of train noise. There are a number of good restaurants and bars in the area. This hotel was a great base for exploring the city

<Content>Newly Opened, fresh new rooms, great location This property is new to the NH group and has only been reopened totally refurbished within last 5 weeks of this review. I believe there is a tower/building 2 which was refurbed under the previous owner and has not been touched, so I recommend you ask for a room in the main building. I booked 3 comfort rooms which were very well appointed and spacious. Two of the rooms had balconies with table and chairs. The bathrooms are good if a little on the small side. The whole feel was quite trendy. Staff were friendly and recommended a good Sushi bar neraby called Kuchi which was great. On the negative side the bar doubles as a small restaurant and is a bit soulless. But to be honest you are in the middle of Berlin right on the Kurfuerstendamm so you wont want to be eating in the hotel anyway. The is a public car park right next to hotel. A prefect location for both business and sightseeing in Berlin.

<Content>Good Facilities Booked a standard double room for 4 nights.Was impressed by the size of the room and the fact that it had an HD flat-screen etc. Best thing about the hotel is the wellness centre on the top floor, with a gym, sauna, Turkish bath and relaxation rooms. Good location on a good street. Best meal we had in Berlin was Eisbein in a place called Schildkr枚te which had typical local food, walk out of hotel, turn left and cross over the Kurf眉rstendamm, about 1 min from hotel.Taxi from Sch枚nefeld airport is more like 鈧?0 than the 鈧?0 most places claim.Recommendations: 1. Beer Gardens in the Tiergarten.2. Schildkr枚te restaurant.

<Content>Great hotel for our needs It's right by Ku'Dam, one of the best shopping-streets in Berlin. ex. Tommy Hilfinger's store is one minute walking. That's also the S-Bahn at Savignyplatz (with lots of cozy caf猫's and restaurants), and U-Bahn station. So you got all of Berlin in easy reach. We got a huge room with lots of space to our luggage. We didn't got a room with A/C, but it was not a problem with comfortable temparatures at nights.

<Content>Good value We stayed at this hotel in the midst of a heat wave in Europe, but found the room quite comfortable despite not having a/c. Windows opened fully in the European tradition, onto a lovely courtyard where the complimentary breakfast was also served. Room was small but adequate. Friendly staff. Quite conveniently located, within easy walking distance of the K-damm. Available on-street parking. One note--the back of the hotel is adjacent to the train, with a frequent commuter schedule, and can be noisy with the windows open, although with soft ear plugs, completely manageable! An overall excellent value.

<Content>No-one mentioned the S-bahn Good location. The old main building is getting a bit dated and the breakfast room and breakfasts were average. The new annexe around the corner is very nice, with spacious rooms and glazed inner courtyard. However, no one mentioned that it fronts onto the main S-bahn line. We had rooms at the back and with windows well closed and earplugs (light sleeper) it was OK. If you get rooms at the front of the annexe, I hope you're a heavy sleeper as the trains are incessant. Good couple of restaurants locally and bar in hotel OK if barman a bit surly. Receptionists seemed friendlier in the annexe than the main building. Overall I would go there again.

<Content>Excellenct! My husband and I stayed 5 nights at this hotel during a conference in Berlin. Compared to my friends' choices, this hotel has great location and good breakfast. It is on a side street adjacent to major sight-seeing place, so, it could get a little noisy while the window are opened!
