<Content>Terrific for Families Fabulous location, easy, quick walk to the U-Bahn station; even quicker to Wurtenburgplatz, with restaurants, ice cream (!), bier garten. KaDaWe department store is right around the corner. Kaiser Wilhelm cathedral within easy walking distance.They were installing the elevator while we were there, and it was almost completed. Difficult to walk up 4 flights, but I managed (knee issues).Room was huge--family of 4 slept very comfortably. Bathroom was tiny, but not a deterrent. Big high ceilings, molding, huge windows. Breakfast was substantial, and the kids loved the scrambled eggs.We were able to check in early (thank you!) as we were exhausted from the train ride. And at checkout, they accommodated our luggage for several hours while we continued to roam about.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in July 2008, with our two young-adult children in a family room for four. The location is excellent, on a fairly quiet street only a block from the subway. Many restaurants are nearby, and there are some excellent shops within easy walking distance. The hotel is old but in excellent repair, and refurbishing is underway with a new lift just installed. The breakfast was excellent and the staff were friendly and helpful. The only negative was lack of air conditioning in 31C weather, as our upper-floor room was very hot. Overall, an excellent choice for a visit to Berlin.

<Content>Lovely!!! We stayed 3 nights- the hotel is very centrally located, just 2mins walking from KaDeWe mall, 1min walking to metro station. Rooms are very spacy reminding of an old German mansion. Very clean. Breakfast was amazing!!!in our next visit to Berlin, we will definately choose the same hotel!

<Content>Location, Location, Location My daughter lives in Germany. We went to visit her recently and the 3 of us went to Berlin for a weekend. We are Choice Hotel members and used our points to stay at Comfort Hotel Auberge.We loved the hotel it was so centrally located. The hotel has a fabulous breakfast included in price of room. The room the 3 of us got was unbelieveable. There were 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, and a very nice living area. I'm guessing it was at one point a manager/owner apartment. We were able to park our car on the street with a special tag the hotel gave us for 5 E. I was expecting to pay more. The hotel is right next to the famous department store KaDeWe. KaDeWe is an experience not to be missed. The store was decorated for Xmas and just beautiful. The hotel was also near the metro at a major stop so very easy to get around. We took a sightseeing bus the first day to get aclimated to the city. Turned out to be a great idea. That was also right near hotel. If you are in Germany near XMAS don't miss the xmas markets in most cities.

<Content>Great little hotel Stayed two nights at this hotel on a recent tour thru Germany. It is a small hotel with spacious rooms, most of which have a small balcony. The rooms are very clean but we did have a very, very small bathroom. The location is great, directly around the corner from some great restaurants and tons of shopping. The price also was reasonable. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Peaceful setting Had a great four days at this hotel. No prior knowledge of location or hotel and what a great surprise on both parts when we got there. Great location for eating, U bahn (Wittenberger Platz) and nice walk to S bahn (Zoologischer Garten). Load of shops around: Ka De We (expensive), designer, Nike, Adidas, Wertheim (affordable) and nice eateries (especially 'Paydos' just around corner in Platz from hotel - steak great!).Checked in at 23.30 without any problem. Friendly welcome - better mood than mine. Room on 1st floor very comfortable, spotlessly clean, tea/coffee supplies adequate. Smallish bathroom but ideal for two. Shower lovely and hot. Towels changed daily and room kept very clean. Airconditioning unit very useful. Breakfast plentiful with good coffee. Lovely ambience, especially as the four days we were there the sun never seemed to stop shining. Free use of PC and Wireless network (charge) available.Overall we could not have wished for a nicer and friendlier place to stay and would not hesitate to return.

<Content>Spacious room and perfect location The location of this hotel is fantastic! This is the famous shopping area of Berlin with the KaDeWe right next door, so there is plenty to do after the other attractions close for the day. Plus, with a metro stop right outside the hotel, you can easily be anywhere in the city in just a matter of minutes. We were also pleased with the size of the room and that they provided a crib for our baby daughter. Our favorite part was the beautiful breakfast room where we had a relaxing start to every morning. This hotel is the perfect blend of old charm and modern rooms. We were very pleased with our experience and highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location for shopping I stayed here with my boyfriend 3 nights in December, 2005. We reserved double room through Internet and the reservation was ok. Room was large and spacious. I especially loved the high ceiling. Very simple equipments, there was only tv and couple of tables and beds, bathroom and safe. I think the rating was 3 stars. The hotel has no lift.Breakfast was free and there was plenty to choose from. Coffee especially was excellent! I think the best part was the location. Department store KaDeWe and the biggest shopping street was just right around the corner. Metro station was also very near.The staff was friendly and when we checked out, they let us storage our luggage there for a couple of hours. The lady at the reception was very friendly and she spoke very good english. They also call you a cab if you need one. This was appr. 110 euros per night, so it isn't the cheapest one, but if you plan to do some heavy shopping, then this hotel would be a very good choice.

<Content>Great value We stayed here for six nights over the Christmas holiday. Great value for money (we paid 60 euro a night, including breakfast) Our room was large, however the bathroom was extremely small! The staff were friendly and the rooms were clean. Don't expect too much for breakfast although for the price we were pleasantly surprised. The only disadvantages are that there's no lift, carrying luggage can be difficult!- if you can manage to climb several flights of stairs it's worth it - our bathroom was too small to turn around in!- don't know if they're all the same.
