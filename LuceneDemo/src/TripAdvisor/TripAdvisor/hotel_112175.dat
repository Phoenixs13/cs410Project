<Content>Run away, far away! This is the Extended Stay on 16th in Phoenix. What is that smell!, What is that on the floor of the bathroom? Is the person at the front desk on parole, or just a crack addict? These are just some of the questions you will ask yourself at this hole!Oh God does this place suck! Never again!

<Content>Lingering awful smell......trash in halls We booked our stay at this place since we thought it was a reasonable price for lodging with a kitchen and living area, especially during a popular time to visit central Phoenix. We had to find lodging immediately and read a review that praised this location. We were immediately disappointed with the smoky halls, elevator, and awful smell of air freshener that permeated our room. The room was small and a lot of the amenities were missing--we had no bath mat, no washcloths, kleenex, soap, shampoo. We had no idea that the maid service was only once a week and were disgusted to find that patrons were simply placing their trash bags in the halls. We also did not like the shady characters that were hanging out in the halls and apparently living there long term. The only positive was the location but nothing else. Our price was $140/night but in retrospect we would have been willing to pay much more to stay somewhere else. We would not recommend this place to anyone.

<Content>Nice place for the money Booked through Priceline and paid about $75.00/night. The hotel's website price was $125.00. Clean room. Nice pool area. Good value for the money. Great location. I would stay again at that price. I would say it's a very solid 2 star property. My only complaint is that we stayed over the weekend and they only serve their continental breakfast Monday-Friday.

<Content>St. Patrick's Day In Phoenix We stayed here for 4 days from Thurs. through Mon. on St. Patrick's day in March 2007. We were given a smoking room (which wasn't our first choice but it wasn't super horrible). Our second night there, someone knocked at the door at 3am (he was wearing a towel and nothing else) this didn't frighten me or my mom but I had a hard time trying to go back to sleep. Here is the skinny; the worst part about the hotel was going down to the check-in to get new towels everyday b/c there is no maid service until you stay past 4 nights (so no trash dump, no made beds, no new toilet paper, no tidying up), the halls were smokey (but it was a smoking floor), there were ciggy butts under the sofa that we moved a bit to set it apart from the air conditioning unit (which is in front of the window on the floor), when someone shuts their door, the whole side of that floor resonants and they allow pets (pro or con), the front door key doesn't work and you have to phone the front desk to let you in after 8pm. The best part of the hotel is that the rooms are relatively clean and newish, the bathrooms are large, to use the internet in your room, the charge is only $5 for the entire time you are there, parking is readily available for no charge, there is a partial kitchen in every room (2 burner stove, full size fridge and 2 pans w/utensils for 2, 3 glasses and coffee cups) , if you are used to a simple room with no amenities, this is much better and it was safe for me and mom. I can't comment on the pool b/c we did not use it and the free breakfast is only Mon.-Fri. 6:30am-9am and we missed it. It served our purposes and I've certainly stayed in much worse places, but the no maid service was a bit buggy.

<Content>Good location, friendly staff but had a few problems I stayed here during the first week of March with two other family members. Our room consisted of a computer desk, coffee/endtable, two queen beds and a comfortable full-sized loveseat pullout. Space was very tight for three adults. To watch tv, one of us had to sit in the computer chair. There are only a few drawers and one smallish, unlit closet to put clothes. Even with all the room lights on, the closet was a black hole. We actually had to use a flashlight to find things. The kitchenette was functional. A two-burner stovetop, a 3/4 fridge, a small sink, a toaster, a four-cup coffeemaker, and four pieces of each type of flatware plus dishes and cups. Room service is weekly so we constantly ran out of things--toilet paper, towels, soap, etc. and had to get them from the desk downstairs. We ended up buying some things on our own. The amenities were ok. The exercise room is mostly a stairmaster and two treadmills. It is also the vending room and laundry room. It also has a big window that opens to the outdoor seating area so you can hear the tv when you're outside trying to enjoy nature. We only tried to use the breakfast room once and all they had was coffee and plain bagels. No juice, milk, muffins, cereal, etc. that I've seen at similar hotels. A fellow guest who has stayed here in the past said that this was a new development. Probably our biggest complaint was that the hotel did not enforce their own policies. The non-smoking signs were completely ignored by at least three rooms on our floor. The smell of cigarette smoke woke me up at 6 am every day and the lone elevator area also reeked of smoke. The elevator area was also a popular place for dumping bags of trash. The keycards seemed to be a recurring problem, as well. Cards that worked in the morning didn't work in the evening. The staff seemed to be aware of the problem. Thankfully, there's a phone outside the main doors and the entrance is visible to front desk staff. The outdoor areas were nice. There's a good-sized pool with a large concrete deck and lots of chairs, a jacuzzi, and a nice pergola-covered grilling and outdoor eating/\sitting area. The jacuzzi was the most popular in the early evening and, during baseball spring training at least, seemed to attract the six-pack and pizza crowd. By far, the biggest advantage to this hotel is the location. There's a nice, small park across the back parking lot that has a sidewalk for walking, there's a diner directly across the street, and an Enterprise car rental about two minutes away. Camelback/the Biltmore area, and all its shopping and dining, is only a block or so away.

<Content>Smell of Pet Urine I stayed at the Extended Stay Deluxe for three nights while attending a conference nearby. Check-in was very easy. The hotel used to be a Sierra Suites and is appealing from the outside with well kept landscaping. The lobby and interior hallways were well kept and the elevator functioned properly. There was a pool but I did not swim. There is a small exercise area with at least a treadmill but I am not sure what other equipment as I only went in to get a bottle of water (the excercise area is also the vending area). The room included a full kitchen with stove, refrigerator, microwave, glasses, silverware, pots, pans, plates, cups and a coffee maker. There is a small desk with a cork board above it, a small couch with coffee table, a tv on a swivel so that you can watch tv from anywhere in the room. The bathroom was ok, not great, not horrible. When I entered the first day there was a heavy smell of air freshener. When I returned the second day the air freshener smell had gone away and there was a heavy pet urine smell. I called down to have them send up some air freshener and they sent someone up right away. I later noticed that the couch was covered in pet hair. Staff was very attentive and went out of their way to ask how my stay was but somebody needs to be able to walk into a room and be able to smell that things are not right before the guest notices a problem.There is a 50's style dinner directly across the street called the 5  Diner. I had breakfast there two days. The food was good but the service was below average. I also ate at a Mexican restaurant about two blocks away called AJO Al's. Great atmosphere but the food was suprisingly bland. I paid about $80.00 a night for the ESD and booked it directly over their website. I choose this hotel because the company that was providing the conference recommended it. If I were to return to Phoenix I would probably not stay here again.
