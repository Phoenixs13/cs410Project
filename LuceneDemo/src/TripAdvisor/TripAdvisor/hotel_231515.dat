<Content>Not worth the money This is meant to be a 4 star hotel. When we arrived the member of staff that checked us in hardly looked at us and didn't even tell us where our room was. The rooms are average and we had a superior room that was meant to cost an extra 鈧?0.00. But the worst part was the breakfast. We thought that it was included in the price but it was an extra 鈧?3.00 each. I have thrown better in the bin. I could not even get a cup of tea. I recommend not paying them the money for BK and going across the road to the bakery. This hotel is really not worth the money.

<Content>Good Hotel, but not great The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful.The food is fair and the service is good.Breakfast is 13 Euros. If you aren't very hungry, there is a bakery across the street which is cheap and very good.There is a Cafe Restaurant across and up the street which is also very good. You can hear the people next door cough.

<Content>Awful!! We stayed at the Husa Arenas in June 2008. Staff and food were okay. The worst part was: they never informed us that the A/C was not working. I thought I did not know how to manage the A/C buttoms and was embarrassed to call reception... then, they let us know the A/C was broken up and unsure when it would go....indeed, it never worked out during the three-day stay and no alternative hotel or any compensation was provided. As a result, we had to sleep with opened windows and being awaken at 6am because of the sun and traffic noise (and by the way, very noise rooms). I agree...not a 4-star hotel..if it was in the past, not now. Quite far from the centre as well.Not recommended at all.

<Content>Breakfast is good, everything else, less so... The breakfast here is indeed very good and possibly one of the best I have had in Spain (admittedly given the English appetite at breakfast that's not saying much!) However I agree with the other reviewers in that it is simply way too noisy- I stayed in a first floor room over the reception and could here people coming and going all night. Also I thought the rooms were a bit dirty (I was there for four nights and my towel was never changed) and I found it too far out of the city center... The staff were nice though...

<Content>If you are looking for a real 4-star, this is definitely not it! The hotel is clean, large storage areas, and bathrooms have been renovated. Staff is very friendly and the food in the restaurant is good. Location is also good and this where visitors to the neighboring university are suggested to stay. However, here is the problem: if this is a 4-star Hotel, then my house is Chateau Versailles! I organized a course and suggested to 20 people to stay there: I was embarrassed. It is the biggest lie anyone can make. This is a 2-star hotel, at most 3-stars (pushing it) old beat-up furniture, Austin Powers-style, dating from the time of Cervantes. No robes, no iron, no slippers, no coffee machine, incredibly small elevator (if you press on 8th floor before pressing on 4th floor it goes to 8 and then the other person has to come back to 4; only works in sequence!!!!), no sound insulation between rooms (you can hear your neighbor snore) and the bathroom amenities are up to the cleaning staff: they leave you some or nothing, depending on their mood.

<Content>Noisy Rooms We stayed at the Husa Arenas in Dec 2005. Staff were excellent, Food was good Rooms are very very noisy. Paper thin walls, you can hear people in next room talking, clearly. Bathroom ventilator shaft goes right through to bathroom next door and you can actually see into their bathroom!! When someone else in the hotel runs a bath everyone gets to hear it!!The noisiest room we've ever stayed in.Oh and the beds are rock hard.and its a very long way from the centre. 30mins on tube or 20 mins by taxi
