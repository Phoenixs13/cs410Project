<Content>Four stars no way! I booked this hotel on easyjet. The hotel looks nice, but beware:It is a long way out of Barcelona, 30 minutes to walk to the station and then 20 minutes on the train. The hotel has a big gym, but it is very poorly maintained. The pulleys would appear to have never been greased, so the machines all stick. This ruins the whole experience. But by far the worst aspect is the FOOD, the breakfast was very poor and always stone-cold, and I mean STONE-COLD, how this then gets four stars is beyond me, this wrecked our break. I found a dead fly in my cereal dish, which were dirty having been washed - yesterdays food dried on. The mats on the sun-loungers at the pool were filthy. In all I would not recommend this hotel, if you want to visit Barcelona then stay nearer to the centre as this hotel will detract from a truly great city.

<Content>Nice, hotel but too far out for sightseeing We booked the hotel well in advance but didnt really realise how far out from the centre of Barcelona the hotel really was. The taxi man had a little trouble finding the hotel from the airport and it cost us 39 euros. The hotel itself was very quiet. I think we were one of maybe 20 or 30 guests staying in the hotel. The outside and lobby areas were clean and tidy. The hotel had some redecoration work going on inside on the corridors. The hotel does need a bit of re-modernising but it was fine. The rooms were spacious and the bathrooms were love;y. It has a nice gym that you can use and an outside pool which wasnt open due to it being out of season. We stayed half board and got a pretty good deal. Breakfast was ok and lunch or dinner would have been fab for me only i completely hate fish and thats all that was on the menu. Some of the waitressing staff didnt speak english so i ended up eating bread rolls and a desert for my dinner, and the free bottle of wine! But if you enjoy fish then the food looked amazing. We usually got the bus which was a 5min walk from the hotel into fabra i puig. It cost 1.85 euros. From fabra we got the metro into town for around a euro. The buses were frequent enough but it did take around half and hour. Myself and my partner were there for sightseeing but with the hotel being so far out it was a bit restricting. However we did have a great time and would definately recommend going on the Bus Turistic which takes you on 3 different routes around the city . It is the best way to see it and its cheap enough 23 euros for 2 days. You can get on and off wherever you like. Just to note , all museums are closed on mondays which we were disapointed about and the Tibadado (highest peak in barcelona where you can get a tram from) is only open at weekends! Barcelona is a great city but if you are going to do the touristy thing dont stay in this hotel, stay somewhere closer to La Rambla (main touristy place) or by the port.

<Content>Excellent value I simply feel compelled to write about this hotel. We have stayed at this hotel a number of times and I just feel that it is hard if near impossible to get better value at any other hotel in Spain. We paid 50euro per night (room only) for our stay here. It is a 4 star hotel and is just off the A7 motorway which runs from France to Alicante. The hotel is very clean. There is free internet access in what they call 'the internet corner' near reception. Staff could not be more helpful. Reception area is nice and very clean. They have a bar/cafe area at reception which is never very busy. The rooms are large and spacious but definately are far too brown in colour. The airconditioning works well. There is a minibar with spacious fridge in the room. There is also internet access in the rooms but you must pay 22 euro per day for that. The pool is never too busy and the water appears clean.It is quite difficult to find the hotel. It is probably easiest to get to if you head for Sant Cugat and then head for Cerdanyola from there; you should pass the hotel on your way.Cerdanyola itself has very little to offer. There is an Irish bar unfortunately called 'The 1916' there which is very nice. The train from Cerdanyola into Barcelona costs just 鈧?.30 per adult one way and takes about 20/25 mins.If you want to enjoy a nice hotel at a reasonable price, it is hard to beat it!!

<Content>middle of nowhere but still good value Booked last minute on arrival in Spain. You have to have a car to stay at this hotel....it is in the middle of a technology parc miles outside Barcelona, badly sign posted especially if you arrive in the dark !!However, though booking a triple room to accomodate our 4 year old, on arrival all the standard and triple rooms were gone so they gave us a suite....with a bed big enough for 6 adults. IT WAS HUGE, clean and comfortable !!! Pool is a bit shoddy but we weren't there for the swimming at that time.The staff were very helpful and apologetic but the room made up for it.....they even gave us a favourable rate on a second night that we hadn't intended.The only downfall of this hotel (other than location ) is the food....breakfast was buffet style, mainly continental ...hard rolls, flavourless pastries etc. ....but with some very cold, greasy hot extras that were produced by the most surly looking staff they could employ...shame they spoilt it !!

<Content>Great Deal I stayed at this hotel with my partner on a dinner, bed and breakfast basis the night before we flew back to the UK. We just really wanted somewhere to crash before going to the airport and the hotel provided that.The hotel itself was in an industrial area so not really much use for people wanting to see the city of Barcelona but we knew how far it was from the centre before we booked and we had already seen all of Barcelona the week before. If you stay at this hotel have a car as otherwise it won't be any good to you. The room size was good and had a huge bed. Everything was clean and well maintained. There was free internet access in the lobby and we used this to catch up with emails. The included meal was from a set menu (3 choices of each course) which was great for one night but I understand that it didn't change that much so not much good if you are staying multiple nights. We also had a nice bottle of wine and this was included in the cost of the room deal. The breakfast was also fine, but not everything was topped up all the time so get there early to get the best choice.

<Content>In the middle of no where Stayed here with my girlfriend on 27/12/04 for new years for 5 nights. I don't think we could have stayed in a worse location. We booked with lastminute and they stated it was prominently located in the heart of Barca, like --... It's basically the next town outside of Barcelona, Cerdanyola. It's a 30 minute walk to the train station which then takes further 30 minutes to reach the city centre. There's bus down the road from the hotel but they're infrequent, cabs will cost 25 euros to get to the centre. We stayed on a breakfast  dinner basis inclusive basis, breakfast was a continental buffet where the cooked food was cold and not replaced after the arrogant/rude german guests ate it all with their quadruple servings.. For dinner there was a fixed a la carte menu which was ok on the first night. But the hotel kept the same menu for 2nd, 3rd  4th nights irregardless of complaints made. They displayed alternative menus but refused to let you order as they didn't have the ingredients to cook with?? Reception was passing blame on kitchen, and kitchen staff likewise. No one taking reponsibility for the administrative errors and lack of organisation, and also no managment in sight. After the 2nd night, we ended up having breakfast, dinner etc in town and purely used the hotel for sleep. Never the less the rooms were of a good standard, and cleaned regularly. I wouldn't stay here again as it's far too much aggrovation travel wise, will definately be more central next time...

<Content>great place to stay..too far from the city I stayed here July 18-23 2004.This is a great hotel...reasonably priced (60 euros) and I would recommend it to anyone who has rented a car in Barcelona. However, if you do not have a car for your stay (I did not) then stay closer to the central area of Barcelona (Catyluna). In order to get there you must take a regional train from Place de Catyluna to Cerdanyola..which is about 25-30 mins. then take a 7 min taxi ride to the hotel. Travel cost about 20 euros per day for 2 people. The train stops running at 11pm and if you are still downtown you will have to take a taxi back to the hotel...30 euros later you will wish you had listened to me. The hotel does not tell you how far they are and even if you questions them extensively they will lie (they lied to me twice about it). It may be a bit more expensive to stay downtown but it makes more sense if you think about how much money you have spent travelling. Also... I would recommend eating elsewhere...I order a piza as a snack and I was presented with a long hair wrapped around my pepperoni.I would probably stay at this hotel again if i had a car..if you are travelling on a budget...stay elsewhere..it will be cheaper.
