<Content>Nice Hotel for the Value We went on a cruise from the Port of Miami and wanted a hotel that was close to the Port. This property is excellant for the value. They allow you to leave your vehicle with no charge. Which is wonderful due to the Port charges $20 per day. The hotel staff is very nice. The only negative aspect is this particular property recommends a shuttle service that will take you to the port for $10 per person, but the shuttle service fails to tell you they can't to round trip service until you have returned from your vacation. If the service had told us that up front then we would not have had to wait 45 minutes to get a cab. I suggest that you call a cab. The price for the cab is a little more, but you won't have to wait when you return for a ride back to your vehicle.

Everybody believe me , if you choose this hotel, you will live bad times in miami.The first Everything , there is not any map in this hotel. You will find this hotel adresses very difficult.

<Content>Reasonable  Went on a cruise end of February 2007 and it was in a decent location for leaving from the port (no, it is not directly across the street!), we rented a car, but they did have transportation going to the port for a fee. There is a Walgreens and a Publix nearby (within walking distance) to pick up anything that you may need for the kitchenette. It was what we expected for $100/night. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly and it was in a fairly safe area. One downfall - there isn't anywhere nearby to go out to eat, unless you have a car to go downtown or to South Beach. Regardless, we were pleased with our stay.

<Content>MOTEL 6 ON STEROIDS My next installment in a long line of hotel reviews. Amazingly enough up until now I have never stayed at an extended stayamerica. Greatfully, unless I am terribly hard up I will never stay in one again. This hotel is really a motel. It has the hardest bed I have ever slept on. As expected no one here speaks English but that was anticipated. There was a $70.00 fridge a hot plate and a desk that comes right out of MIKES used furniture. Let me say I have stayed in worse places but for the money this is not worth it. I recommend you spend the extra $100.00 and stay at a nice place. $150.00 is too muchthanksTodd
