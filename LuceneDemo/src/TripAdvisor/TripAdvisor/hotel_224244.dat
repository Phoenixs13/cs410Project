<Content>Excellent hotel and staff, but Hampton's reservations were a problem We stayed three nights at the Hampton Inn / Dadeland over a weekend. There were an overwhelming number of positives for this hotel. Most of all and first of all, the staff were professional friendly, and eager to ensure our stay was a pleasant experience. The room and common areas were clean, and there was no chemical odor from cleaners or disinfectants. The beds were fairly comfortable, even the fold-out couch I slept on. Despite a full hotel, all the guests were quiet, and we never had a problem with noise or really any sounds from other guests.Problems were few... we were on the 4th floor and the wireless internet service was spotty. The connection dropped almost as soon as it was made. The staff tried to help but it may have been a problem with our location in the building. Had this been a business trip, I would have requested a room closer to the lobby for better wireless service.Another thing was a misreporting of available space by the Hampton Inn website. Hamptonnn.hilton.com consistently told us that for the few nights we were there, the hotel had at least one nonsmoking room with two doubles available, when in fact the hotel had no such rooms open. We accepted a room with a king bed and a fold-out sofa. The staff were very apologetic about the repeated error, and I don't fault them at all - it's clearly a problem with Hampton/Hilton's online reservation system.One last positive from a very negative situation we had. My wife had a very sudden and very unexpected medical emergency at 345am the last night of our stay there. After I ensured she was stable, I phoned the front desk in a half-panic. Even at that late hour, the phone was answered within two rings and the man who answered was very alert, he listened carefully, got my request right the first time, stayed calm, and arranged for Miami Fire and Rescue to call me - which they did within the next 60 seconds. In another ten minutes, the EMS crew was in our room and in short order my wife was taken to nearby Baptist Hospital, which for us was an excellent choice. (My wife is fine now, thank the Lord.)During all this, the Hampton staff I dealt with were helpful and concerned. Even with shift changes, every staff person I dealt with was up to speed on what was going on with us, and they worked with me for the late checkout time I needed later that day. Of course we'd rather have spent our last night in Miami at the Dadeland Hampton Inn than at the $1,000-plus a night hospital room we ended up in, but for this Hampton's great service and their professional help in a frightening time, we were most grateful.

<Content>Very nice and good value Overall an excellent choice for a few days in Miami. Lovely room, very helpful staff and a great free breakfast including cereals, fruit, pastries, hot biscuits, waffles, sausage patties etc.Loads of free parking.Very close to Dadeland Mall and approximately half an hours drive to South Beach.We had difficulty finding the place, but we're not used to driving in the US and had just come off a 9 hour flight!!

<Content>Quite Nice It was a nice stay for us. The plus points: It is quiet, clean, comfortable and affordable. At the complimentary breakfast the fruits are fresh and the coffee of a decent quality.The negative points: While it is fairly close to the shopping malls and the metro, the access is not walk-friendly. One needs a car esp as the 'hotel shuttle' appears to do little shuttling. One needs a car to get around. And yes, the hot breakfast is worth a skip.In the final analysis, we had a comfortable stay.

<Content>Orange bowl stay 2008 Hotel can be a bit difficult to locate, but follow directions on US 1 and look for the hotel near the traffic bridge. Hotel was fully booked with seasonal travelers and individuals like myself who were attending the Orange Bowl game. It was very cold in Miami during the dates of my stay, and we needed to use the in room heater, which had not been used in some time. The room smelled of the never used heater for the night...but we adjusted. The hotel has an adequate business center that can be accessed with a special key. Hot tub was fine as was pool. Breakfast was standard fare for Hampton Inn, but the hotel was not providing the brown bag to go breakfast bags, which I use as I always sleep in. Rooms were quiet and clean, bed was very comfortable. Plenty of resturants nearby....so food choices are ample....Front desk staff was more than willing to assist...Saturday am breakfast was unique as all the weekend travelers meant that the yoounger kids were attacking the breakfast bar, so be prepared, but the hotel staff does its best to try and keep up, even though I watched people step in front of them....Overall, consistent quality that can be expected from a Hampton Inn...KU won the Orange Bowl so we were all happy, but the Virgina Tech fans who stayed in this hotel were sad....

<Content>Perfect for us. The Hampton was exactly what we expected and in my opinion represents excellent value for money. Very friendly and efficient check-in staff, all room amenities present and working, plus it was clean and tidy. We didn鈥檛 sample the complimentary breakfast but it was laid out as promised, with coffee, juice and pastries. It was almost next door to Dadeland mall, which is what we wanted, as we planned to do some shopping before driving down to the Keys the next morning. Obviously public transport issues were not a problem as we had a rental car. On site parking was good and directions to the hotel were straight forward and easy to follow. There were numerous restaurants, (mostly chains), a short drive from the hotel. In conclusion, if you driving South to the Keys, or simply looking for a budget hotel in the Kendall area, that has good amenities and is close to a mall, the Hampton would seem a perfect choice.

<Content>Good Budget Hotel If You Have Your Own Transport This hotel gives pretty much what you would expect for a budget hotel.Rooms were good sized  only slightly dated with all major facilities included. They do non-smoking rooms as well, though the one I was offered smelt badly of cigarettes (but it was changed without any problem).For food you really need to go out (though there were a lot of delivery pizza leaflets in the room). I did not find this any problem with restaurants around Dadeland Mall being easy to get to by courtesy bus or cab (about $7). There are cabs outside the Mall entrance for getting back.Breakfast was OK (for free!) but not overly healthy in options.For myself, I would stay closer to Dadeland Mall next time, but this is only on location. The hotel itself was a good option as a budget stopover.

<Content>excellent value I stayed at the hampton inn, dadeland for 4 nights in the beginning of november. The hotel is very clean, there is is free parking and the breakfast is fairly good.There is also a business center with free internet and the hotel is very close to a major mall.The only disadvantage is its location, about 20 min from south beach and 10 min from coconut grove, more during rush hours. But since one cannot stay in Miami without renting a car, quality for price is excellent. Would definitely return there

<Content>Return Stay a Winner As things worked out, we were pleased to have 2 return stays at this Hampton this month. As in my previous stay, the staff was very kind and the hotel is just what I expect from Hampton : clean, quiet, comfortable and spacious. The free breakfast is good for a free breakfast but if you want something better, there is a Roasters and Toasters restaurant about a half mile south on US 1 which is pretty good. The pool area is clean with a hot tub available as well.One glitch on this stay was the in-room movies were not working. Wasn't sure if it was the remote control, but wasn't really interested much either. The cleaning staff was very good. I like the coziness of this Hampton. Love the Free WiFI at most Hamptons since it is very convenient for getting my work done. I stayed in a King Study with Sofa. This room unlike my stay last December did not have a small fridge, so ask for a room with one if you need one. If you're into shopping, there's Dadeland Mall about a quarter mile away or across the street is a shopping center with a Best Buy, Target, Sport's Authority, Michael's and a Bed, Bath  Beyond. Just remember from my previous review, if you're not from Miami, the hotel may be a little difficult to find. There are signs on US 1 just past the Dadeland North Metrorail Station( heading south). If you miss the turns, call the hotel for directions. Also as with Hampton, there is free parking; however, this hotel is so popular, the parking lot fills up quickly. There are spaces in the very rear which is well lit up at night. The Bed is the BEST with excellent comforter and duvet... spare pillow and thermal blanket are in the closet.. ( my wife is very picky due to a bad back and she loves these beds!)As I may have said in a previous review of a Hilton or the Conrad, I think that even though Hampton is not full service hotel, it may very well be a better value than it's more expensive cousins.

<Content>Helpful staff much appreciated We stayed at the Hampton Inn Miami Dadeland for one night in June 2007. The room was spacious and the bed enormous. Although the room was generally clean, I did drop an earplug behind one of the bedside cabinets and didn't appreciate finding an old, used condom when I tried to retrieve it!The hotel is conveniently located to the US-1 and the Miami Dadeland mall. The hotel staff were extremely helpful, happy to offer any assistance they could. Breakfast was okay, but a little crowded as it's so popular.All in all, I'd recommend this hotel, just don't go looking behind the furniture!

<Content>My favorite Miami hotel I travel to Miami frequently and this is my favorite place to stay. It sits off of US 1 so you are close to everything but not right in the middle of the traffic congestion that you often find on US 1. The beds are fabulous and I sleep better at the Hampton Inn than at home. The staff is usually very helpful. Breakfast is probably one of the best for this class of hotels. You can walk to the mall or the Metrorail station which is really convenient. If you are visiting the University of Miami it is a fairly short drive, or you can ride the Metrorail right to the University.

<Content>Smart Choice I am Ecuadorian and stayed at this Hotel in November 2006. I went with my wife and my 3 years old son for a week. Here are my highlights:1. Excelent if you are shopping. The hotel is in the middle of Dadeland Mall and Dadeland Station Mall (at walking distance), 2 terrific places to shop. Also it is one block from the US-1 where you will find many other Malls like The Falls, Merrick Park and so on.2. Great for one night stand. They have a complimentary shuttle which takes you from/ to the airport and 2 miles around the hotel.3. Eventhough it is extremely well located, the rooms are so quiet and beds so great, you will rest for sure.4. Complimentary breakfast is OK, nothing spectacular but enough to start the day. Good coffee though. They serve biscuits in the afternoon too.5. Rooms are well sized and clean with a small fridge and microwave, really convenient. Free self park.6. Staff is very friendly. They gave every morning Springhill bottled water to my son, which I consider a nice touch.Tip: You won't see the hotel from the US-1, so look for a small sign on you right, going south, just after Dadeland Station Mall. There turn right.

<Content>loved the bed stayed for two days. The bed was the best I have slept in even better than many 5 star hotels such as the Loews. Location was excellent for me since I wanted to shop. Hotel also provided transport to and from airport which I had not expected. I would definitely return...very good value for the price!!

<Content>EXCELLENT VALUE FOR PRICE Recently stayed here for 5 days. Rooms were super clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Loved the fact that the room had microwave and refrigerator. Free breakfast was an added bonus. The DSL allowed me to keep in contact with my office. Very easy to use. Would definately stay there again.

<Content>Great value We stayed at this basic' hotel for 4 nights as it was located near our friend's house. we had flown from the Uk for a short break. The hotel picked us up from the airport in good time as we called them from the passport queue not when we had got our luggage. Rooms were very clean and spacious and all staff very helpul. Breakfast included but lousy but luckily Dadeland MAll is 5 mins walk away. Also 5 mins away id the station to downtown miami. Ideally though need a car.

<Content>Good Miami Hotel Stay....for a change After a rocky start with the shuttle we enjoyed this hotel. Waited about 2 hours for the shuttle because another large group grabbed the shuttle before us. I don't guess this could have been avoided unless the hotel took reservations for the shuttle. The hotel was nice and clean on the outside. It sits real close to the huge Dadeland Mall. Also there was a Target and a few other stores close but we did not have time to explore much. The Hotel Shuttle will take you to the malls and we took it to the mall to eat and shop a bit. The rooms were quiet and clean and we all slept well.I would stay here again
