<Content>Conference type hotel Loved the rooms! Spacious, with big bedroom and a living room, (flat TVs in each of them), super clean and elegant marble bathroom. Bathroom goodies in a full set. It gives a full comfort and cozy atmosphere.Polite and professional staff. Only negative side is the location. The hotel is far from the metro station, although there are three Ms in the surrounding area. Each of them is far 10-15 minutes walk. Unless you have your lap top with you and use the hotel free wireless internet, the hotel charges its internet service 4 EUR for 1/2 hour. Also, we kindly asked the receptionist to confirm our stay in one of the Majorca hotels, where we were heading after, and they charged it. For a call of 1 min, it seemed a bit odd to us. They give reasonable rates for a 4* hotel. Pictures from the hotel posted on the websites are authentic to its original look. My husband and I both agreed that the hotel is a conference type hotel and intended for business people, rather than tourists coming for sightseeing. In any case, we totally enjoyed there, especially the first day when we did not even want to go out and meet the wonders of Barcelona! Kalina (Skopje, Macedonia)

<Content>Good value hotel We came back from Barcelona yesterday havng stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. We were very happy with our stay. All rooms are in fact suites, and despite being relatively close to Avenue Diagonal (the main artery of the city), the triple glazing effect that the enclosed balconies provides meant that we were never disturbed by street noise. The hotel furnishings, though not new were quite well maintained; there was an LCD TV in the sitting room and a portable in the bedroom; there was more wardrobe space and more hangers than usual. The bed was comfortable, although the pillows were not great.  The hotel is located several tram stops (or 10 minutes by taxi) from the main tourist attractions- and was all the better for it! We were attending a conference, so chose the hotel location for its close proximity to the conference venue. Having stayed in the tourist zone before, we had been disppointed on a previous visit.There is a really nice department store 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and lots of lovely restaurants- we asked the hotel concierge for recommendations, and he directed us to 3 different restaurants within 5 minutes' walking distance on consecutive evenings*, which were all spot on- catering for local people, rather than tourists- the food was excellent and very reasonably priced. *Casimiro restaurante was our favourite- wonderful fish and steak

<Content>brilliant! stayed here with my girlfriend in November, we actually booked this hotel based pretty much only on the price, but when we got there couldn't believe how good it was.Less than 5 minutes walk from the Metro station in a quiet part of the city, it looks a bit strange from the outside. Inside is very modern and clean, and all reception staff speak fluent English, which was just as well given that my Spanish extends about as far as asking for beer!The room was actually more like a suite, with a seperate sitting area with a comfortable sofa, a telly and a fairly large dining table. There was also an enclosed balcony area, but there was no way of opening the windows which may be a problem in the summer?We had a problem with the shower on our first morning, which actually turned out to be entirely our fault (we couldn't find the on button) but this was sorted by helpful staff less than 5 minutes after we mentioned it to them.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. I didn't eat in the restaurant, but it looked good. The whole place was excellent value, I wouldn't have been surprised to pay double what we did!

<Content>Looks better than on the website Room was very spacious with beds in separate room to lounge area - bit unusual for normal hotel room that isn't a suite. Large bathroom with bath and shower but water pressure was low. Very clean. In nice quiet part of Central Barcelona with good access to public transport. Photos of the hotel from the front do not do it justice.

<Content>good value for money considering the hotel is classed as 3* it is fantastic, the rooms are very clean and very spacious. i stayed in a quad room with 3 friends, there was a bedroom with a double bed and in the main living area there were two very comfy sofa beds. there were 2 bathrooms and a balcony.The hotel breakfast was continental that was not really to my taste but others may enjoy this.The hotel receptionist was very friendly and booked us our taxis whenever we required them.....The hotel was very reasonably priced it cost 40 euros each, beware of the %7 tax charge on arrival though, as this was not mentioned when booked.

<Content>Lovely Stayed here in July, and I have to say that it was one of the best hotels in Europe I have ever stayed in. The rooms are mini suites and have a seperate living and sleeping areas divided by glass sliding doors. My only disappointment was that I could not sit on the balcony as they were glassed in, but you could stand at one of the side doors to view the area. Great place but if you don't like walking stay nearer the Ramblas...
