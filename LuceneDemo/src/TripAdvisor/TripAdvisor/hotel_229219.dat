<Content>can't beat the location You can't beat the location. Small rooms, decent service.The hotel did not know where a laundry was but they reminded us they did have a service. 5 Euros for underwear. There was a laundry around the corner.

<Content>A lovely hotel We had a lovely stay. Taxi from Tegel Airport was 17euro, although the bus no 109 is only 2.10euro per person (you need the correct change) The airport bus stops at the end of the road. We arrived at 11am and was told a room was ready! Wow !Check in time is 2pm, so a real bonus to unpack and get straight out sightseeing. Very helpful reception staff, the lift is a bit small but works fine. Room was perfectly ok , air con worked a dream as it was 30c on arrival. TV gets CNN and BBC World Service and all of the local channels. Bathroom, ok not the biggest but had a bathtub and shower. Breakfast, very good. 0630-1030. Extended continental spread with hot food as well. The scrambled egg, bacon and sausages were very good. Room service available. Hotel is located on a busy side street off K Dam, with the hop on hop off tour buses just up the road. Its in a very safe, up market area.  Hotel has a small bar, next to reception. The hotel is officially 4 star, and has the German Tourist badge saying so by the entrance, but i must admit many would only rate it as 3 star for its comforts. But its location, and the very helpful staff do indeed make this a four star option, without paying the much higher prices demanded by other hotels nearby. We would certainly use this hotel again, we had a lovely city break here. I look forward to my next stay!

<Content>Good priced hotel for singles/couples. Berlin is a wonderful place to stay. We really enjoyed our 5 days there.We regularly stay in European cities for pleasure but this was our first time in Berlin. We don't stay in hotels too much and try to get to see as mmuch of a city as possible so we were looking for a cheap mid range hotel.The Holiday Inn in Kurfurstendam was a lovely hotel. Not a top range one so don't expect too much but the rooms were modern and clean although a little on the small side. The bathrooms were recently updated so very clean and modern. It was quite noisy being on the main street as the windows are not double glazed and very thin so you could hear the bin men in the morning amongst other traffic which was quite loud.Also the room was very hot as we went in the winter so heating was on but you could not manually turn it off or even down. We had to open a window to cool the room. No safe in the room but you could use the hotel one for no extra charge.Your immediate impression as you enter the lobby is that its very small. The bar area is just 2 chairs and a desk but the staff are very helpful and friendly and we even had a chance to practise our German with them which they were more than happy to help us with.Like I say this is a good quality hotel if you won't be permanently in you hotel room throughout your holiday. Not ideal for families in my opinion. More for couples/singles who are sightseeing.

<Content>Great Location It's the location that makes staying here a winner; it's on Bleibtraustrasse which has lots of very nice restaurants and leads up to the Savignyplatz area which also has loads. Of course, it's near the Ku'damm too with its shops. Public transport is excellent, e.g.the bus from Tegel airport stops at the top of the road.My room was fine, clean and sufficiently equipped with very efficient air con. Breakfast was standard Holiday Inn.Top Tip! Look up in the entrance lobby, the mirror's fab.

<Content>Good value for money This was my about my 4th or 5th stay here so that tells a story. The hotel is very clean, the staff are always cheerful and helpful and everyone I've spoken to spoke excellent English.The rooms are probably a bit on the small side but nothing really to complain about. They are are kept very clean.The breakfast is more than adequate.My only moan is the amount of noise that comes from the rear of the hotel. There is an underground car park and an overground one. Also, in the mornings, the delivery trolleys give you no chance of sleeping.The location is excellent, as said before, it is in an upmarket area of Berlin. The tendency is to turn left out of the hotel but by turning right and exploring south of K'dam you will be rewarded with fantastic bars and restaurants in the side streets.All in all I believe this hotel represents very good value for money.

<Content>Excellent location. Good servicable hotel We (2 adults and 2 teenage boys) stayed during a short break in February. The hotel was clean and reasonably well appointed and good value. It looked as if some areas were being redecorated but this didn't cause us any problems. Breakfast was a standard continental buffet in an airy room on the top floor. Again nothing special, but good coffee and a good selection of rolls, cereals and meats. Could have offered a wider chice of fresh fruit.Unlike other reviews, we found the staff friendly and helpful. Being able tospeak to them in even rudimentary German helped, I'm sure, even if their English was good.Location is great for public transport and a good selection of restaurants. A nice up market sort of neighbouhood where we felt quite comfortable.

<Content>Only Positive Thing Is Location The only reason I stayed at this place was because I got a decent rate through Priceline. After over 30 stays in the past with Priceline without a problem, this was the first time I felt like I was stuck in a 2nd rate room. The entire room smelled horribly of smoke and the staff seemed indifferent when I requested a non-smoking room. Even as a Priority Club Member with Platinum status, I wasn't expecting any sort of upgrade, but they couldn't even accomodate a room type request. They had the keys set aside before check-in and didn't seem to want to go through the hassle of changing anything. Not to be sexist, but I agree with other reviews of the female staff not being helpful or personable. They seemed to be sitting around and not doing work most of the time, while the only guy I saw during my stay seemed to be doing all the work. Otherwise, the location is great for access to the shopping area and restaurants. It's less than a 10 minute walk to the Zoo Garten train station, the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, and there was even a nice Hard Rock Cafe a few streets down.

<Content>OK but really nothing special Stayed at this hotel for one night in January 2006. The rooms were on the small side but fine for one person, though there was no way you could get more than one person in the bathroom. Rooms were clean though again, disappointing in that there was no shampoo or shower gel etc, only a multipurpose soap and shampoo dispenser. Not good enough for a hotel of this class. The other disappointing thing was the staff. There were two I had contact with; a young man was perfectly personable but there was a young lady who was extremely rude and impolite, barking instructions at me. Wouldn't come back here unless it was dirt cheap. It's a little bit away from the action, but incredibly well-connected - the bus to the airport (109) stops at the end of the road.

<Content>good stuff Can't think of a single bad thing to say about this place. Rooms were perfect, staff was friendly, location great. And we got our room in the middle of summer for much cheaper than the price listed here only booking a week ahead of time.

<Content>Well located - great for a shopping trip! The hotel is in a great location - just off one of the main shopping strips in the city. Air con has been installed in all the rooms and there is even complimentary fresh fruit in the room to welcome you! One word of warning though - be careful with the pay-per-view movies - there is no infomation on screen informing the viewer that the film you may have flicked onto is chargeable......e12.50 for 3 minutes.......!

<Content>Recommended Very good hotel to suit both business visitors and tourists. Clean and well appointed rooms, friendly staff and a great location with easy access to the buses and underground. Located in a quiet side street in what seems a safe and pleasant area. Air conditioning has now been fitted - temperature etc. being set via remote control - which is a real benefit as Berlin can get very hot. Breakfast buffet is good (13 Euro if not included in the room price, you can easily eat enough to be able to skip lunch) Good value for money and I would certainly recommend it.

<Content>Great location! The hotel is located in a street just off the Kurf眉rstendamm and close to the station Zoologischer Garten, a great location. The hotel is clean and pleasant, the rooms big enough with a clean bathroom and the staff is very friendly and helpfull. Breakfast was excellent. On the Kurf眉rstendamm, very close to the hotel, you can take the Berlin hop on hop off tour.Also the Berlin musical theatre Theater des Westens is within walking distance of the hotel. The only minor thing is that there is not a very big choice of restaurants very close to the hotel, but we cannot blame the Holiday Inn Garten Court for that. A great choice for your stay in Berlin!

<Content>Tourist heaven The friendly and knowledgable staff on the front desk are most helpfull. The rooms are normal business/tourist class with everything you need. Situated on a side street of the Kudam, only a low degree of traffic noise spoils the quiet. Close to most of the shopping and the zoo with superb transport (U bahn, S bahn and frequent busses to all parts of the city). I would willingly use this hotel as a base for a short holliday in Berlin.

<Content>Nice place to stay I was there July 9. Clean but small rooms, friendly staff, but no A/C. Windows open to the street or to a parking garage, so there is noise... They have a (or two?) non-smoking floor(s) and the breakfast room is non-smoking. Good location, half a block from the Ku'dam, and 7 blocks away from ZOO Station. I would return there, but I would definitevely ask for a top-floor room!

<Content>only location is good Small, old hotel only the location is good. The staff is very rude, the rooms are small and dirty, the corridors make you feel unsafe, th茅y are small, dirty, dark and have paint coming out everywhere. This hotel is not worth the money, better spent a few euro's more and stay at the Crown Plaze or any of the golden tulip hotel. This kind of hotels give holiday-inn a bad reputation
