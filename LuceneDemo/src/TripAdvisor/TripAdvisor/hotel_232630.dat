<Content>great personnel delightful hotel. I recommend to stay over the weekend since Frankfurt is a busy city on weekdays (convention central!) The location is quiet and near a city market. The owner was unfailingly accomodating . I arrived fairly early in the morning - without warning. The owner offered me some coffee while I waited for the room. The room was clean and spacious... really classy place!

<Content>lovely, personal hotel We stayed one night and loved the place, due to the nice design - real art in the rooms, and a very friendly owner. It is a small, friendly and personal hotel, in a quiet street. We would return any time.
