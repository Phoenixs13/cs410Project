<Content>Rude Management The hotel manager was the rudest human being I have ever encountered. The property was filthy and overall bad experience.

<Content>Really nice place! Stayed only 2 nights, but the location was great for us. The hotel and room was really clean. Very quite, and the staff kept the grounds very nice. Used the gym and the morning breakfast and close to alot of resturants...not walking distance.Very nice place to stay!

<Content>rooms need a little attention The motel was quiet, spacious, and cheaper than most in the area. I wish I had known that they have an indoor hot tub. It is not advertised and I didn't find out about it until it was too late to take a soak. The maid didn't pay the best attention to the room. The bathroom floor was sticky, and our clock was unplugged. We had to crawl under the bed to plug it in. I would think the maid should have noticed this. We also could not get our toilet to flush properly. After several tries it would clear enough to use again, but never completely flushed.
