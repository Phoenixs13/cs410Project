<Content>Great Location, Good for the Price The Hotel Sari Bunga is a pretty basic, Motel 6-like hotel. It's very clean and has a reasonably spacious bathroom. It has hot water, air conditioning, and a fan. The main thing that bothered me about the room was that there was a really musty, moist sort of smell, which was bothersome enough that I purchased incense to burn in the room. The lighting in the room was terrible, so it's definitely the kind of place where you just stay to sleep, not to lounge around or hang out. The pool was pretty dirty, but it's so close to the beach that you probably wouldn't be using it anyway. At $30 a night, I can't complain and will probably stay here again the next time I'm in Bali.The service at the hotel was pretty much non-existent. The staff was polite but seemed very lazy and could not be bothered to do anything. The restaurant looked terrible. I sat in it for 20 minutes once, and nobody bothered to even give me a menu. Fortunately, there are a lot of great places to eat within walking distance. There's a cafe just a couple of blocks down that does really good breakfast for under $2, with delicious coffee and juice. I can't remember the name of it, but when you exit the hotel, turn right, and it's on the right side of the street (same side as the hotel), and there's a big sign with an ice cream cone in the front. They also have really good homemade gelato.The location is the best part of this hotel. It's in Legian, which is between Kuta and Seminyak. It's on Jalan Double Six (AKA Jalan Arjuna), and all the taxi drivers knew where it was. From the hotel, it's about a five to seven-minute walk to the beach. If you turn left, you can walk to Kuta, and it takes about 20-30 minutes to walk to the main road there. If you turn left, it's about a 15-minute walk (very pleasant) to Seminyak. The beach by the hotel was reasonably clean, but it gets cleaner the further north you go (towards Seminyak).
