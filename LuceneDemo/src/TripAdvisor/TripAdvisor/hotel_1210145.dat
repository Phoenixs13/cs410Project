<Content>Little Gem! This is a little gem of a hotel! Situated in a quiet part of town it is a bit of a way out from all the action but the hotel give you a free travel pass for the trams which run 10 minutes away, every five minutes, into the centre. Really nice people, spotless rooms, great breakfast (for Germany!) and you can even cook in the rooms in the miniature kitchen in every room. For best prices, book on line or try e bay!
