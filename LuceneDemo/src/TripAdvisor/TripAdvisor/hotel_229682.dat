<Content>Sleepless in Barcelona We stayed in this hotel on the 9th October 2008 for one night before we joined a cruise ship. Despite asking for a quiet room, we were allocated a room overlooking the Ramblas. This was a good size of room which was obviously for a family as it contained a king size bed and a single bed as well as a convertible couch in a small annex. The en-suite was in need of some upgrading and the toilet sat on a raised dais which was strange. The shower was best avoided as there was no bracket to hook it on to.Our problems started when we retired for the night. There was shouting and screaming outside until 5am and it was impossible to get any sleep and even then normal daily activity soon woke us up again. The proximity of a 'gentleman's club' almost next door to the hotel may have been a contributory factor to the nocturnal racket.We would advise anyone thinking of booking this hotel to make sure that they are not allocated a room to the front . If you are, insist on another room immediately.

<Content>Beautiful Barcelona Barcelona is such a beautiful place and staying at the Ramblas Hotel just added to our time there. The vibrant Ramblas is on your doorstep and I couldn't think of anywhere better to sip coffee and people watch! The hotel itself is above average. The room we stayed in was well presented with a great view. The room was turned down every day and had handly little extras like tooth brushes and even a sowing kit. The breakfast was one of the best I've had in any hotel in Europe, lots of fresh fruit, pasteries, bacon, egg etc, yummy and just what you need to set you up for a day of site-seeing in the great city of Barcelona.The hotel staff were friendly and we were able to keep our bags all day in the luggage room as we had a late flight.

<Content>Enjoyable stay We stayed at the Hotel Ramblas for 4 nights and had a very pleasant stay. The location is excellent, right in the centre, close to the Barri Gothic area and had easy access to the tourist bus. We took the airport bus to Plaza Catalunya for 4.05 euros and walked 10-15 minutes to the hotel. We had a large bright twin room with a window overlooking the Ramblas on the 6th floor.(Room 606) Obviously being on the centre of the Ramblas street there will be some noise but I did manage to sleep well every night.  Other reviewers mentioned about pickpockets and petty crime in the area. We did not notice any incidents but one of the restaurants did mention to us about being careful about my rucksack and not leaving it hanging on my chair. There is a safe in the room which costs 2.50 euros a night so it is advisable to take out only the money you feel you will need and leave as much money, important documents, passports etc behind.  The reception staff were very helpful and we had a late return flight and were able to leave our luggage in their luggage room when we checked out. Breakfast was plentiful and varied from cereal to cooked breakfast to cold meats and cake. There was plenty of everything and nothing appeared to run out.  I can recommend the Barcelona tourist bus for 1 or 2 days at 21/26 euros for giving you an overall view of the city. Highlights were the Guell Park, Sagrada Familia ( we didn't actually go inside due to the large queues) and the Casa Milia( La Pedrera), all examples of Gaudi's work. There are lots of art musuems to go and visit but we did not have time to do everything.  In the evening we ate in Les Quinze nits restaurant which is in the square across from the hotel. It is recommended in lots of the guide books for cheap good food in elegant surroundings. The food is indeed good and there are queues in the square when the restaurant opens in the evening at 8pm.  My only criticisms of the hotel were that in the morning when the taps were turned on in the bathroom there were some bad smells. This was also noticeable outside when walking around Barcelona that the sewage system smelt. My other criticism was that the hotel did not provide a booklet about the hotel to give you more information. The reception staff were very helpful about the times of breakfast and tours etc but it would have been helpful to have had more information about bar prices etc  Overall we had an excellent break and would be happy to stay in this hotel again and visit Barcelona again.

<Content>great location Me and my family recntly stayed at Hotel Ramblas Barcelona in a quad room. It was a very good experience. The staff was friendly and the price was reasonable. But above all the location was excellent. It was situated bang in the middle of La Rambla, the main tourist street of Barcelona. Everything a tourist can possibly do, was available at the doorstep. The room was also nice and clean and pretty large. It was divided into two sections, one which housed a single bed and the other which housed a double and one single bed. Still there was a lot of moving space in the room. A good 3 star hotel.

<Content>Very Comfortable I had a great 3 night stay here in a large room with a balcony (unexpected) overlooking the beautiful La Rambla. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helped us out whenever we had a question about where to go out or the best way to get to the airport.

<Content>Stay Away From Ramblas Stay away from this hotel. They ended up charging us twice since we refused to take a room away from the hotel down a dark alleyway and up three flights of stairs. There are better opportunities just a few blocks away without all the hassle

<Content>Location, Location, Location A group of 19 of us stayed here in Oct 2007 for the weekend. When we arrived check in was swift. We then all met in the bar for drinks before our evening exploring barcelona. Sorry I can't remember the barmans name (he was from venezuela i think) he was great fun and very tolerant of our requests. This hotel is almost next door to the boqueria market. You can walk to Placa d'spanga in 5 mins (if you choose to ignore everything happening on the ramblas) and the beach is not far in the other direction. The breakfast was good, buffett style with something for everyone, the rooms were basic but clean (some had a balcony) you could here a bit of noise but you don't go to barcelona for rr but if you did you wouldn't stay on the ramblas! The hotel is good at catering for large groups (we were on a work weekend away) and I 'm sure stag and hen parties would be fine. Don't expect 5* luxury, it doesn't pretend to be this its a budget hotel in the best location. Enjoy

<Content>loved the city! myself and my boyfriend were in Barcelona in feb 08. We had a fantastic time and i would go back tomorro.The hotel was a lot smaller than it looked and we paid for the location more than the hotel. Its a very small hotel, however the rooms were clean. There is no bar at the hotel really. However, we were right in the middle of ramblas and close to all the bus tours and shops. I highly recommend the bus tours, very enjoyable!!one thing we really were not mad about was the food. Its not great at all!! we found a few gr8 irish bars and were good craic!I would go back to barcelona tomorro but i think i would stay in a different hotel.

<Content>Poor management very good location we had a good room on the 8th floor for our family . However the breakfast was a scrum with one pathetic tea and coffee machine and not enough tables.The restaurant was closed with no apology or explaination and the staff were unfriendly.We put up with this only to find that on our return on the 2nd day (we were booked for 4 nights) they had locked our room and tried to throw us out . The manageress was very nasty and reduced my 8 yr old to tears.It turned out to be their error but only because I had all the paperwork she would have left us on the street . We booked through thomascook.com and would recommend them to take it off their list for their apalling attitude .Make sure you have all your proof of booking !

<Content>Good position but......... I stayed here with a party of 15 guys and it was booked by one the party. The best thing about this hotel is it's position, secondly the price. Outside the door is the Ramblas. No walking to find on your door step entertainment and food and drink. Its also a short walk to the tour bus stop, a much longer walk to the beach, about 30 minutes.The staff were fine and the rooms clean.One big gripe for me was the plumbing! Having stayed out until 2.30am on our first night I was eager to get some sleep after the travelling. At 6.30 I was awakened by horrendoes noise from the water pipes when people used the toilets and showers. Having spoke to the rest of our party it appeared all the rooms have the same problem. Our room was tiny with no windows, but as we stayed out until 7am the rest of our trip this was not so much of a big deal. I was told the breakfast was fine with plenty of choice although I never made it down once in time.So to sum up, if you want a peaceful lay in bed - this hotel is not for you. If you want to be in the middle of the action at a good price - fine. My advice is ask to see the room and get drunk as a skunk and you dont hear the plumbing!

<Content>Horrible location and rooms I booked this room through Flight Centre, which I will use again but I will definitely research the hotels first.This hotel could have been in a prime location, minutes from the Mediterranean and right where the action is on Las Ramblas. However, the level of crime against tourists is very high in this area and someone tried to steal my backpack at the Internet Cafe, which is right next door. Pickpockets are ripe in this area so be very careful.Not only is crime high in this area, but the room they put me in was terrible. It had NO WINDOW and I could hear every single toilet flush, sink running, and conversation that happened in the hotel (maybe not all conversations but the plumbing for sure).There are also two Nudie-Strip joints within a few yards of the hotel and the area is rather seedy as a result.If I were to go to Barcelona again, I would stay somewhere near the Passig de Gracia instead of on Ramblas. And I would never stay in this hotel again. The staff at the hotel were great, which was the only redeeming quality.

<Content>Dissapointing and expensive We stayed on 2 separate nights. One room was拢170 on a Sunday and one 拢140 on a weekday. The rooms had windows that looked onto concrete walls. The lighting was poor. The plumbing from the other rooms was very noisy, very often. The breakfast was poorly organised - it took 10 minutes to queue at the only coffee machine and everything (food, plates, cutlery) ran out.On the plus side the reception staff were friendly and very helpful and the bar staff were very nice. The hotel rooms were clean, reasonably large with lots of wardrobe space. The hotel is well placed for the centre of Barcelona.We did also try have some sangria outside at the Ramblas pavement cafe. The sangria was nice but the table cloths have holes in, the furniture was shabby and the plant pots on the outside edge of the caf茅 were stuffed with old cigarette butts which were very smelly and unpleasant.

<Content>Good Value For Money Having arranged a trip for 7 women aged betwen 36 and 60 I was a bit worried with the first 2 reviews I read but, having already booked, there wasn't a great deal that I could do about it. We were allocated a triple bedded room and 2 twins. A drawback we hadn't expected was that the 2 twin rooms didn't actually have a window although there was a patio door behind drawn curtains that looked out to a concret wall. Must admit it came as a bit of a shock especially when our friends in the triple room on the 8th floor boasted a fantastic view over the rooftops. Our immediate reaction was to seek a change to a room with a view and on approaching staff we were asked to enquire at reception the following day when changeovers were due. However, we didn't bother because in all honesty we were hardly in the room. We were there for 3 nights and we were only in the rooms to sleep. The rooms (and bathrooms) were spacious and very comfortable with plenty of wardrobe space and were cleaned every day with fresh towels etc. Yes, the flushing toilet from next door did make some noise but it was shortlived and out of the 7 of us I was the only one to use earplugs (something I do everywhere I go). It's certainly not the noisiest place I've stayed but I would recommend taking earplugs just in case if you happen to be a light sleeper. The breakfast was generally quite good although there was a bit of a problem with the orange juice machine on our last day and they did slightly overcook the choc au pains (not that it stopped us eating them anyway!). The bar was comfortable and there were no complaints from any of us with regard to the drink measures or cost. We had a fabulous break; the hotel was much better than we'd expected and it's location was absolutely right for us and was definitely value for money when considering what the holiday including travel actually cost us. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in! This hotel was substituted for another by a travel agent, and I was told it was comparable to a 3 star hotel, and it definitely was not. The room was 85 degrees F in April and there was no A/C. The only window opened to an airshaft seven stories below! In the middle of the night a fight erupted in the hallway with people banging on someone else's door. Breakfast food (especially the orange juice) was awful. Staff had an attitude about calling a taxi, but were helpful about some other things. Definitely no more than a 2 star hotel, and should only be considered by those on a tight budget!

<Content>The worst hotel i've ever stayed in!! The worst hotel i've ever stayed in. The room was dirty, the furniture was lopsided even the tv was on an angle (with no english news channel!) the bathroom smelt of sewers (even after all the taps were run). Complained and then complained again and they gave me a different room. This room at least had different tv channels!! with CNN news. However the bathroom still smelt of sewers!! all of the time.The staff on reception were pleasant but somewhat ineffective. The dining room staff were downright awkward and unpleasant even to the extent of switching off the hot ovens before the end of breakfast even though guests were still entering the dining room. Not a hotel I will be going back to.

<Content>Nice Place Just got back from a weekend in Barcelona stopping at the Hotel Ramblas. I cannot comment on anything to do with the cost as it was a freebie! That aside when I return to Barcelona, which I will at some time I would consider stopping here again.Before I went I was a little worried by some reviews, but as it was free wasn't going to moan. When we arrived I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was clean, the staff very friendly. We were early and they told us our bags could be left in a secure room prior to check in. When we did get in to our room, we had a good size family room. It was very tidy. There was no view as it was at the back of the hotel, but this did not bother us too much, although I would like a Ramblas view next time, as long as it was high up to avoid the noise of the Ramblas.The buffet breakfast was very good and had an excellant selection of pastries, cereals, bacon and eggs and even Cava on saturday morning!If i was to warn people of anything it would be do not get a room near the lift as the lift motor was very noisy, and might disturb you.All in all a nice hotel in a very convenient location.

<Content>Great Location, questionable stay Rooms were small, noisy (thin walls) and decent bathroom. Great location right on Ramblas. Dont' expect service or any help. Front desk people tried to help. They seem too busy to help. We paid about 70 euros -- I think. Not for older travellers.On a positive note, because of flight problem, we didn't arrive there until a day later. They didn't charge us on a condition that we would stay there extra night.

<Content>Terrible hotel, no service, no quality We stayed here for 3 nights in december. There really is nothing good to tell about this hotel and I will NOT recommend anyone to stay here.Check-inn was very slow, we had to leave our bags at the hotel for hours before we could enter the room. The room was poor: the walls had dozens of spots without paint, the bed was hard as stone. The bathroom was almost falling apart.Also, you could hear every sound coming from the street and when guests from another room at the same floor used the toilet, you could hear it, even coming from 3 or 4 rooms down the hallway.We only had breakfast, this was poor also. Sausages were extremely spicy, almost uneatable. Eggs were often cold. Orange juice was pure sugar, but still was the best part of breakfast. If I only knew this before... Ramblas is full with decent bars where you can have a good breakfast.Each time we asked a question at the reception, it took the staff ages to do something. The last day, we asked to store our bags in a closed room, one staffmember however forgot to lock the room, so our bags stood there unsafe for the whole day.Location was good when it came to getting around in the Ramblas/Barri Gothic area, but way to much noise.

<Content>Fab location, could do better I should say upfront that we didn't experience the problems that other guests seem to have had. Maybe we were lucky, or else it's gone downhill since we were there. We thought it was a great hotel for the location and the price, but there's no denying it could do better.Lobby a bit desolate. Staff a bit surly. Lifts very slow indeed. No problems with check-in or payment, slow to check out though, and despite the hotel saying they'd called a cab for us, we ended up flagging one down ourselves to get back to the airport, otherwise we'd have been there forever. Our room was OK, we were at the front, and yes, it was noisy, but so are all cities at night. And you're on the main promenade in the city, with loads of restaurants and bars and nightclubs close by. Take earplugs. The view was fab though. And the room was clean, and tidied daily.Bathroom seemed fine, we didn't experience huge noise when using it, though you could hear others flushing their loo next door. Again, it seemed comparable to other hotels I've stayed in - or maybe I just expect low standards of sound-proofing. Certainly not the worst I've experienced by any means. Ours was quite nicely fitted out and clean enough, though obviously not new, and could have done with a little grout scrubbing here and there.Breakfast was fine, plenty of seats, nice range and quality of food. Nothing special, but more than adequate.What really sells this place is the location. Right on Las Ramblas, walkable to the harbour, walkable to many of the sights, loads of food places close by, and the atmosphere is terrific. If you want a quiet hotel, this is not it, but it was reasonably priced for the location, and we felt it was safe and clean. I'd go again, but remember the earplugs.

<Content>Not good My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in early November 2006. I have to say it was not good at all. We checked in at lunchtime and we had to wait for 2 hours before our room was ready. There was a very poor selection of food at breakfast and staff were most unfriendly. Worst of all.....the smell of sewage along our floor (4th) and in our room was horrible. When the toilet/sink/shower is used there is a seriously loud rattling noise coming from some of the pipeworks. Soap was not replaced when used.....sheets were not changed. The only positive remark I have to make about this hotel is its location .....very central. Otherwise it was a horrible place to stay. I would not recommend it.

<Content>Grat Hotel for the price Before we left we read some of the reviews of the hotel and were quite concerned as a lot of them were negative. We were staying for 2 nights (but with two separate bookings) and were concerned that there would be problems with check in etc . especially as we were arriving late with our 12 year old son.When we arrived the staff were extremely helpful and were given a room on the 5th floor at the back of the hotel - it was nice (and no suicide drops!!!)Breakfast was good and although the hotel was busy, there was no problem with space in the breakfast area.We had to change rooms for the second night due to making two separate bookings - and what a bonus that was - we were given a room on the 9th floor overlooking Las Ramblas - we were high enough not to hear any noise adn had a HUGE balcony overlooking the Gothic Cathedral, La Sagrada Familia - all of the sights a picture postcard from our balcony - in fact it was so stunning we got a tray from the breakfast room the next morning and enjoyed breakfast from our balcony in the sun.There was a bit of a mix up regarding the internet co. we had booked this hotel through but the staff were extremely helpful.I would recommend this hotel, as the amount we paid for 3 for the location was extremely reasonable.

<Content>Horrible Hotel We just returned from our honeymoon in Europe and Barcelona was our last stop. I have to say that the Hotel Ramblas was the absolute worst hotel we have every stayed in. Our room was filthy, the plaster was coming off of the walls, the cleaning lady did not change our sheets (there were visible stains) and did not provide extra soap for the remainder of our stay. The staff was rude and completely unhelpful. Everytime we flushed the toilet, used the sink, or the shower (horrible), there was an unsettling, extremely loud, rattling noise (I seriously thought that the toilet would explode). When we notified the staff of these issues, they barely looked up and basically LIED to our faces by saying that they would send someone up. They never did, nor was the issue ever mentioned to other staff because when we went downstairs to follow up (we couldn't call... all of the room phones were disconnected), they looked at us like we had two heads. Our tv was missing a remote, but they did attempt to fix that problem- by sending up a remote with missing buttons and which was for a completely different tv.Bottom line- I hate this hotel, the staff was terrible, the rooms are gross, and the breakfast selection was lacking. If we didn't go through a travel agency and prepaid, we would have left that first day. I will never recommend this place to anyone.
