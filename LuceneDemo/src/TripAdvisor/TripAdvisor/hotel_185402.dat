<Content>Good value This hotel appears to have undergone a recent renovation. The rooms were fresh and clean and the beds were comfortable. There is a plasma television, free wifi internet, a security safe, and a nice, clean bathroom. The climate controls worked perfectly and the hotel was quiet. I especially like the location, one block from the Paseo de la Reforma, and the proximity of many good eateries. I had some great enchiladas de mole on Rio Lerma just across Rio Mississippi. I will stay here again!-dgh

<Content>Casa Inn - Noisy and Expensive A friend recommended this hotel because of the area it is in (close to the Zona Rosa). However, I was extremely disappointed with it - most of all because of the noise.  The noise comes from the street called Rio Mississippi which it is on. This is a major traffic route, packed with cars all night long, and the people of Mexico City constantly blow their horns. As a result, I couldn't sleep at all. I also found the night-time front-desk staff to be surly.  The only plus was the buffet breakfast, which was excellent. But who cares, if you can't sleep at night ? I paid $80 a night not to sleep !  I then transferred to the New York Hotel, which was only $32, and very quiet, with friendly staff.

<Content>the worst of our stay Our first hotel in DF was in the NH Centro Historico, which obviously was a very nice hotel. After coming back to DF from San Miguel de Allende, we decided to stay at Casa Inn. The room needed cleaning, the walls were kind of dirty, the carpet dirty too, and a few of the bathroom's tiles were broken. The overall quality of the room was very low.Since I had to leave at 6am, the lady in charge of the breakfast told me that I would get a bag with some cakes before departing as my breakfast was included with my room. The morning that I had to leave I went down to the front desk at 5:30am but the person there told me that he had not been informed about providing any breakfast for my room. I just could not believe that I had paid for my breakfast and the manager just let me go without it. I told them to call me a cab to go to the airport and they got me a private SUV. I told the driver that I just needed a regular cab, which usually charges you around $35 from that area to the airport (I had done it before). He said that a regular taxi would charge me around $180. Since I had to rush to take my flight, I had to pay him $150 for the ride. I was ripped off, and the hotel was responsible for getting me this kind of transportation. Pick another hotel if you can, they are irresponsible and incompetent.

<Content>Friendly but slow service Cassa Inn.. the room was nice..nice big tv,however, no one informed us that there was a need fora deposit for a remote...went down, gave thedeposit..the control didn't work. Called the frontdesk and was told that someone would bring oneshortly...no one came. Next day, someone came withthe wrong control. Turns out they didn't have anycontrols for that TV brand. Was told they wouldchange our TV, than told they couldn't do that. Sopaid a deposit for no remote control. Room serviceworst than that. When it didn't take an hour to getour food, they gave it to another room.There was no kettle or coffee maker in the room...sohad to go without it. Their carpets need cleaning. Towards the end of our stay we decided againstcomplaining anymore since they were so slow torespond.However, no complains about the location. We lovedthat we could walk to the Zona Rosa. The area is very nice overall.

<Content>Not a great experience The Casa Inn was ok for the money. The restaurant in fine, as well as the lower level. The rooms have very uncomfortable beds. The mattress sits on top of a slab of wood, no box spring underneath. Our toilet overflowed at 1 am for no apparent reason. The staff refused to help us clean up. We were told that the maids would not be in until the next morning.

<Content>Casa Inn The Casa Inn is fabulous - great location at a reasonable rate (walking distance to Zona Rosa and the angel statue). Breakfast and lunch buffets are great - very friendly and attentive staff. Internet in the downstairs lobby. Rooms are standard size and the bathroom/shower are very spacious. The check-in desk can be a little intimidating b/c not everyone speaks English, but in general they are pretty patient with travelers. I would definitely recommend the Inn.

<Content>No Coffee Hardly anyone speaks english in the hotel. The restaurants breakfast and lunch buffet is excellent. No Irons in the room. No Coffee maker in room. Cannot get coffee until 7 am. Do not take a lower level room because the rooms are poorly insulated and it gets very noisy.
