<Content>Solid stay, centrally located Spent a week here with few complaints. Friendly, effective staff, and, like most Berliners, fluent in English. Breakfast buffet was big with lots of choices. It has the feel of a hotel for business travelers, by which I mean clean, well appointed, but also lacking in character, more of a chain hotel feel. That also means that some service prices are geared to folks on expense accounts. But you can avoid hefty charges for in-room wi-fi by using the free wireless in the lobby. And there's a friendly and much more reasonably priced dry cleaner just a couple of doors down. (Knowledge of a bit of German and/or ability to creatively pantomime helpful there.)It's in a touristy area, which is good and bad. You're close to many major sights, but far from real Berliners. Fortunately a stop for the excellent public transit system is just a block away. Easy to explore the rest of the city.

<Content>a solid choice In Berlin for a recent conference, we were put up at the Relexa. We found it clean and comfortable. The front desk staff were (mostly) impressively multilingual (unlike us) and the room well-organized if not luxurious. There was a small balcony overlooking the (vaguely overgrown) park that fronts the Relexa's street. The bathroom was plenty large and the shower - esp by European standards - outstanding. There was a room safe that held a laptop.The hotel is located well for Checkpoint Charlie and is walkable to the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate. Public transport is close and reliable.Quibbles include a soft bed; overly expensive in-room internet (though it is free in the lobby); and a rather cramped breakfast area (breakfast itself is an interesting buffet, very German. Which is a compliment - it is not a bland selection.) But these are minor issues, irrelevant even for some travelers.

<Content>good choice we stayed at this hotel 1/3 to 4/3 and although it was not our first choice we were very pleasntly surprised because we stayed for three nights we received an upgrade to a superior room. turn right as you exit the hotel and checkpoint charlie is only 4 minutes walk. turn left and the s-bahn is only 50 metres away. there are two or three restaurants at this end of the street. but turn right outside the hotel and right at the end of the street 100 metres up on the lefthand side is an excellant steakhouse with very good food and reasonable prices.we had 250 gram fillet steak with baked potato and green beans and garnish for about 18 euro a head. i think it was called steakhouse assador either spanish or argentinian.

<Content>Pleasant stay at the Relexa in Berlin. We stayed one week at this hotel in late September. As others have mentioned it is on a street with numerous other hotels. We had no issues with street noise, as we asked for a quiet, non-smoking room. The hotel provided us with a room that overlooked a park shared by a number of apartment buildings. The room was quiet, clean and meet our expectations. The hotel primarely caters to European business people and Eurpean tourists. While I speak German, my wife does not, but she had no problem speaking with the staff in english. They were very helpful in answering our questions. The loaction is excellent, as all of the major sites in the Mitte section of Berlin are either within walking distance or a short S-Bahn train ride away. I would recommend this hotel for its location, clean rooms and helpful staff.

<Content>Excellent hotel Have just returned from a 5 night stay at this lovely hotel. The room was bright and airy, with a comfortable bed and spotless bathroom - in fact this was one of the cleanest hotels I've ever stayed in. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful, catering for all tastes. The location is perfect; a pleasant stroll to all main sights or very handy for the U and S Bahn. There are lots of excellent eating places nearby. Our favourite was the Steakhaus Asador, just round the corner on Wilhelmstrasse (turn right at the top of Anhalter - look out for the fairy lights on the left).

<Content>Nice Treat for the Budget Traveler We paid 82 Euro a night for a Superior room, which is reasonable in comparison to the other lower-quality chain hotels on the same block. The location was perfect, and we walked to many of the tourist sights. Also, the S-Bahn is just steps away. Down the block, you will also find a very reasonably priced grocery store and a cheap internet cafe. The room was very clean, somewhat spacious, and our window overlooked a courtyard below. The bathroom was very classy. We made use of the free sauna facilities in the basement, although this relaxation area is just mediocre. This was the most upscale of hotels on our budget traveler's journey! We did not pay extra for the hotel breakfast (we just bought groceries at the store nearby), and my only complaint is that the receptionist ran my charge card through in dollars, rather than Euros, insisting that this was the cheapest way to go. She didn't give me the choice (I would have chose the local currency), and was somewhat rude when I protested the method of charge. Otherwise, however, this was a good hotel for the price.

<Content>Definately not a 4 star I had a great weekend in Berlin (apart from choosing this hotel), I was there for the Anniversary of 50 years of the EU so loads going on. I would definately go back but not to this hotel. Don't get me wrong the location was great, close to Check Point Charlie and to all Public Transport. The only problem was the hotel, firstly this is rated as a 4 star hotel and there is no way this is a 4 star hotel and just to note we certainly paid 4 star prices. The Bedrooms are unbelievably small, we actually asked to be moved but there were no rooms available due to a conference being held that weekend. Our bedroom was at the front of the hotel and the noise from the busy road all through the night was terrrible. It also states that they have a gym, there are only 4 excercise machines here, it like the bedrooms is far too small. Most of the staff OK but there was one in particular when we were checking out that was just so rude. Breakfast is just OK, the continental style. There are alot more hotels to choose from and I would not recommend this one, simply because it is far too overpriced for what you get.

<Content>It's ok but not the best My stay here was adequate. Advertised as 4 star, it was really more of a 3 star hotel. Rooms facing the road were to have special ventilation systems; mine was not working, so they gave me a fan, which was a cheesy fix. The carpets were dirty, but otherwise it was clean, and the breakfast was good, lots of it and some variety. The location is great, and the neighborhood was very safe. Total plus: a rubber duckie in the bathtub! I really WANTED to like the hotel a lot more than I did.

<Content>Good location but not recommended for an extended stay My girlfriend and I are just back from a week in Berlin staying at the Relexa hotel. We booked a superior room for an extra 拢30 over the week. As a previous reviewer commented this is a worthwhile investment as the size of the room we got was only a typical size for a standard British room and I could imagine the standard room option in the Relexa may be quite cramped. The room was equipped with a lovely bathroom, a personal safe and a minibar which is what you expect from a four star hotel.The location of the hotel was excellent for the S-Bahn, with a station less than five minutes walk away. The hotel also has a supermarket and local sites including Checkpoint Charlie five minutes away. The street the hotel is on contains four hotels side by side, resulting in the road being quite noisy at night. With the lack of a/c in the room we kept the window open most of the night which disrupted our sleep on occasion.Breakfast at the hotel was included in the price which is a big bonus when you stay for the week. However with coach parties arriving virtually every night at the hotel, the standard continental breakfast was always busy no matter what time we came down. The hotel does not seem to have the facilities to cope with a semi-busy hotel. It was clearly under staffed, with you feeling under pressure to leave your table quickly to allow someone else to eat. Our last breakfast in the hotel encapsulates the issue when we had to share a table of four with two other tourists! Overall it is a standard four star hotel in a good location for Berlin's attractions which would suit a two/three night stay. However with the lack of a/c in the room, poor breakfast facilities and most of the staff only understanding basic english I would hold back in recommending the hotel to anyone planning an extended stay in Berlin.

<Content>Both Very Cool and Too Warm A very nice place, helpful staff, good location, but wasn't quite all we hoped. We wanted a twin room which apparently they don't have so we had only one queen bed---crowded for two big people. The weather was very hot, and the rooms have no air conditioning or fans. We thought such a modern **** hotel would have AC, even though many hotels in Germany do not. The big window/door did open widely to the courtyard, which helped, but there wasn't much breese most of the time. The location is close to the S Bahn, but that's a separate system from the U Bahn, so it was usually helpful only to get to Potsdamer Platz where we walked to the U Bahn station. Breakfast was very good and INCLUDED, which it wasn't at other hotels we reserved via Expedia, Hotels, etc.(where it cost 15-18 euros EACH) The hotel was generally very clean and well decorated, EXCEPT....the rooms have yellow carpeting which shows every little spill and stain, and there were lots of them. It gave an otherwise spotless room an unpleasant impression. Berlin's a great city---very modern and very historic, with people from all over the world!

<Content>Wonderful Relexa My husband, son and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Relexa Hotel in Berlin. It had all the amenities we were looking for and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our triple room was comfortable, clean and attractive. The breakfast buffet was one of the best we've seen in Europe. Conveniently located near the S Bahn, Checkpoint Charlie and the remaining part of the Berlin Wall, it is an ideal homebase for tourists. I am recommending this hotel to all my friends.

<Content>memories are made of this memories were made when we visited berlin march 2006 and stayed at this hotel.Spotlessly clean, ensuite and superior bedroom/ great buffet breakfast with lots of healthy choices/ convenient to the great railway infrastructure in berlin.Had a thoroughly wonderful 4 day break and would recommend this hotel. Quiet and peaceful at night if that is what you are looking for.Staff attentive and friendly without being intrusive.Managed to get a good price deal also.Would also highly recommend the English Bike Tour situated at the bottom of the TV tower at Alexanderplatz.
