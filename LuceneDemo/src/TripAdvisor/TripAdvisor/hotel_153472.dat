<Content>Happy times I wonder if there is any alternative to Hotel Isabel in location and price? I have been looking, but haven't yet seen anything comparable for my upcoming trip to Mexico City.The restaurant, the bar, the lobby and colonial architecture, friendly staff, and amazing rooftop views made Hotel Isabel a worthwhile stay...add to that the rock-bottom value, proximity to the Zocalo (it's a skip away) and the metro- and it would be very hard to convince me that anything else is as good a value.Rooms a bit dim? Sure. Beds a wee bit on the firm side? uhuh. Are these problems? If these are problems, stay home. I found the people lovely and am happy to recommend the Hotel Isabel to budget travelers.I stayed here on my own, with a student group and with a good friend-each experience excellent, and the restaurant staff began to greet me with coffee just the way I liked it-hey, there is nothing better!

<Content>Shabby but great value for money Great location for exploring Mexico City. In walking distance of most major central sites and close to the metro for travelling further afield. Room was a bit dingy and shabby and bathroom poorly ventilated with a lot of ominous black mold but for $30/night who's complaining (and it's a beautiful building with a lot of character). Staff were friendly and helpful re calling taxis etc but it did take 48 hours and constant pestering for someone to come to open the safety deposit box for us only to find out it was broken so that was a bit annoying.

<Content>The price is right, the location is great, some small irritants I checked in here twice on my recent Mexico trip (start and end of the trip) staying a total of 5 nights. I first had room 112 and when I retruned I got room 115. Both were interior rooms, plain decor with old but sturdy furniture. I didn't care, as someone else said, I was only there to sleep and shower. I was originally given room 108, an exterior room with a Juliet balcony, but the room wasn't made when I arrived and I wanted to shower and nap, so I changed to 112 (which was already prepared). If you get an exterior room, steet noise may be a problem during the day, but in the evening (past 10 PM) the area is quiet. When I was in room 112 (towards the back of the building) noise was not a problem, but when i was in room 115, along the north-wall, which is shared with the hostel next door, I heard noise late into the evening (read: Metallica, the Pulp Fiction soundtrack and ACDC...all music I like, just not when I'm trying to sleep) coming from the hostel. Other have mentioned the firmness of the mattresses...firm isn't the proper term...hard like a rock would be more adequate. The staff was very friendly and helpful in getting me a cab to the airport at 4 AM, notifying me when my bags arrived (due to the airline losing them) and I got along great with the security guards and waitstaff at the resturant. The maid service was a little slow and it is true you may have to wait some time (or ask twice) for certain things, but all truth be told, if you don't sweat the little things and be patient, you'll get what you want in the end. Oh yeah, and that previous posting, where someone mentioned holes in the ceiling, room 112 had two in the bathroom. I zoomed in with my digital camera and took a picture. Nothing was up there and having seen them in other rooms, I think it was for helping the air circulate in the interior rooms. No bad stories about things being stolen and I felt very secure.

<Content>Great Value  The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to the zocalo and all the sights in central Mexico City and also close to the underground.The hotel has 24 hour security, and one of the guards, Alberto, was very friendly and helpful. My room was huge, but lacked a window. It didn't bother me, because I was only there to sleep and shower. The room was very clean, as was the hotel. There's a restaurant on the ground floor, too.

<Content>Rude staff, but an architectural gem Someone else's review mentions being put into a large room with 3 beds that he didn't want, and later his valuables were stolen from the safe in the room. That's interesting, because my boyfriend and I were also given a large room with 3 beds that we did not want. We were later pressured to pay for the larger room, which we refused to do. The staff was very rude about it all, and made a big show of forcing the young man who assigned us the room to pay the difference because we wouldn't.The building is a historic gem, however. And there's a cool bar on the ground floor.

<Content>Large and clean rooms but... The Hotel is very good for budget travelers. The people at the front desk are very friendly but not efficient: You ask for something and it could take several days to get it (like extra pillows, and the key for the safety deposit). I appreciated the room service from the restaurant, which was better than your touristic eating place and with very affordable prices ($3 to $10 dollar meals). The location is wonderful, only five blocks from the Zocalo and four from the nearest subway station. However, if yolu want to buy food or other stuff during a holiday or weekend, the place is shut down because it's the neighborhood for large whole sale.The interior of the hotel is beautiful, with an internal balcony painted in bright terracota colors.The rooms are clean and the hotel overall is kept very neatly.However, I would have given this hotel a higher rating if it wasn't for the mattresses. They are as hard as sleeping on a large piece of wood. We couldn't belive how bad they were and that was the only thing that made our stay less pleasant. I am trying to post this so if you have a back problem or cannot take hard mattresses, do not stay here. Otherwise it's great.The price I paid for four people in one room was $55 dollars with private bathroom. You can pay $18 for a double with shared bathroom or $30 for a double with bathroom.

<Content>AVOID AT ALL COST THIS HOTEL Being a mexican i enjoyed for several years staying at this place because of the convenience of the vicinity to downtown. On 5-feb-06 i booked a room wich i thought was going to be nice. The front desk gave me a room for myself with 3 beds on the roof. The door knob would not close properly so feeling insecure i called the front desk asking for another room, they hesitated for a few minutes and came up with the idea that i should take a room on the second floor (room 205) i accepted. Again when i came into the room i was again surprised that only myself would get again a room with 3 beds. As i was tired from my flight to mex city i checked the safe-box on the wall and as i was convinced that it worked properly i put my money inside of it.while i was lying in bed i realized that the ceiling were very high and that in each of the corners of the room there was a dark hole about 4 in diameter, i joked with myself and thought maybe theyre cameras spying on me. Next day i went out all day and did not check on my money. On feb 7th as i was going out for breakfast i decided to check my money, i got nervous when i realized that my money was not complete. I called the front desk and they sent me a person that said to be the hotel manager i explained my case and he denied it saying that he was the only one to have access to the master key as i was already getting nowhere with him i inmediatly packed my luggage and left. I was robbed in this hotel. Please trip advisor do take this review into consideration. Why was i given a room with a high ceiling and 3 beds? I know my money is lost and i am not planning a lawsuit because of the waste of time but i still want you to warn others of want happened to me in this place.

<Content>Avoid This Hotel!!!! I've travelled to several countries in Latin America and stayed at a good number of cheap hotels, but this one is the worst of all! They want your money and they don't care one bit about your satisfaction. I've reserved a room there one week prior to my stay. The front desk agent promised me a beautiful clean room with a great view, but once I've paid, he put me in a hole with no windows, cracking floor and a bed as hard as a rock. Stay elsewhere, it's not worth the trouble to stay there.

<Content>Very friendly If you are travelling and trying to keep your costs down, but still, at the same time you want good accomodation i would recommend Hotel Isabel (Mexico City). The Hotel is exceptionaly clean, friendly staff at the reception desk. And lets not forget the location, 5 minutes walk and you're at the main square.I was very impressed by the fact that i booked our room 6 weeks before through the internet and till our arriving i got confirmation emails weekly to ensure me that the room is booked for us. I really can't think about anything i'd complain about.

<Content>Orange, Blue and kitschii - GREAT! We loved the Hotel Isabel, from the moment we stepped into its lobby we felt welcome and excited. The walls are painted a shimmeringly colourful orange, while the pillars are contrastingly blue. The four main staff are young and extremely cool and friendly. The beds in the three different rooms we stayed in were comfortable, the rooms clean and very atmospheric. Bathrooms were also clean and bright with strong hot showers. Hotel Isabel's own restaurant downstairs does a smashingly good Chilaquiles for breakfast, with a glass of OJ, cup of te/cafe, and fresh bread with butter and jam for about 55pesos ($US5.5). Highly highly recommended.

<Content>You gotta be kidding! Stayed here one night, 13 Sept 04. The very best thing about this place is.......leaving!!!!!!! Dark, gloomy, water barely dribbles from the faucets, tv doesn't work, neither do the so called room safes, and the bed.....I have slept on concrete floors that were more comfortable and softer. Shabby is not the word for this place. Post dump is more like it.

<Content>A whole lot of character I stayed at Hotel Isabel for 7 nights in May of 2003. The staff was very friendly and would do their best to accomodate myself and the 15 other university students I went with. During the week people from many different countries checked-in, which made for a great cultural experience. The hotel itself is old, but not without character. If I ever return to Mexico City I would like to stay in Hotel Isabel again.

<Content>A Grand Old Lady in the Centro Historico I spent 6 nights at Hotel Isabel in January 2003. The place is a little shabby, in a good way. The rooms are huge and the staff is friendly. The price is down-right cheap, 180 pesos(about $16.50) for a single with bath. The rooms have TV, phone, and safe. There is hot water 24/7. The street noise level can be high. Beware! There is a disco next door that really cranks up the volume on Friday and Saturday nights.
