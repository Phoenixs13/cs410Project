<Content>Good value We stayed at this redecorated Red Roof Inn during the hottest part of a Phoenix summer (113 degrees). The the AC worked great, even though the pool was a little on the warm side, even at night. Our room was clean, spacious, and had a microwave  fridge. The bed was comfy  restaurants were nearby. The new manager at this property was very courteous  helpful. Although the motel is next to the freeway, we didn't hear any traffic noise.Red Roof Inns could improve a great deal if they would:.Provide free high speed internet in every room.Offer a continental breakfast--even muffins  fruit would be appreciated.Amenities--provide a hair dryer, softer towels (theirs were sort of like Brillo pads)  information about the areaHaving said that, we were very satisfied during our stay at this Red Roof and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Not exactly a bad hotel, but not a nice one We stayed at RR North on April 11 for 2 nights, I have stayed in other RR hotels in other states but this time I think it was a room that it was not bad so but nice is not also the adjetive to describe it, clean? Yes, it was... but that smelly athmosphere was uncomfortable even for the kids who are very easygoing they realized about this thing. We were changed to another room with better results, but in average this hotel needs a renovation asap in order to qualify as a chain brand. I would stay there only if there is no other hotel in the area.

<Content>Good price, but you get what you pay for We stayed at the Red Roof Inn in Phoenix in March of 2006 and ended up moving to another hotel after one night. While the price was right, $65 during the very busy baseball Spring Training/Spring Break time, the hotel was average. There were very few ammenities and we had a lot of problems with our air conditioning, which can make a stay in Phoenix quite uncomfortable. There are a few sports bar/restaurant type places within walking distance (e.g. Applebee's), which was convenient, but the location is basically within a strip mall. If you are looking for a bargain hotel that you are just sleeping at, this place would be great, but if you actually want to enjoy your stay in between your other activities, I would suggest an upgrade. The staff was very nice however.
