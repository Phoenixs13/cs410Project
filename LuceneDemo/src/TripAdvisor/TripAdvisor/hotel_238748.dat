<Content>Perfect for a city break Firstly let me just say, Barcelona is beautiful. We had a fantastic long weekend in the city and stayed here.Secondly, this hotel is nothing like a hostel as per the review further down!?!?! We found this hotel to be absolutely fine and perfect for a city break in Barcelona.The Catalonia Albeniz hotel itself is slightly on the out skirts of the city in a more residential area but dont let that you you off. The taxi driver who picked us up from the bus station hadn't heard of the hotel so if you experience any confusion in your taxi, just ask for Aragon as this is right next door. Alternatively, if you are catching the tube to the hotel from the bus station, walk to the Arc Triumph tube station (near the but station), get on the red line north and then get off at Clot.The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the Clot red-line tube station. (From the hotel, turn left outside the front doors, walk to the traffic lights then cross over the road). The tube in Barcelona is definitely the easiest, cheapest and quickest way of getting round the city. Just hop on the red line, go south and get off at Universitat and you are near the Gothic Quarter, Ramblas and the tourist part of the city. It takes about 10-15 minutes on the tube. Tickets are purchased from the machines in the tube station and are cheap. There were young, middle and older aged people on the tube all day and night. We never felt at risk or unsafe.Back to the hotel. The rooms are perfectly adequate and spacious. Our room was on the third floor and was lovely and clean as was the bathroom. The room was cleaned daily. No coffee/tea making facilities on the room but there was a TV (with UK Sky News) and a mini bar. No bar in the hotel but there are local yocal bars surrounding the hotel. Our room soon warmed up once we turned the heating on (Barcelona is freezing in November!!!!)All of the staff were great. Very pleasant and happy to talk to us non Spanish speaking Brits. They spoke excellent English and they were all very helpful.The buffet breakfast is fine. The Spanish sausage isn't that great but there was bacon and eggs and a nice selection of fruit, muffins, cakes and juices.The hotel is a 15 minute walk from the Gaudi's Sagrada Familia. Turn right out of the hotel... walk straight for about 15 minutes then turn right and you should be able to see it.There are quite a few cheap bars and cafes near by. Further to the left there is a shopping precinct consisting of mostly clothes shops and this and that.In summary, this is a great hotel for a stay of a few days in Barcelona. We would definitely go back here. For the price as well it was a bargain.Also, if you are flying with Ryanair from the UK to Girona, be prepared for a one hour bus journey to Barcelona. It isn't a big deal but be aware.

<Content>Great value and handy for Clot Metro Station to City We booked a triple room and although the room was small it was perfectly adequate for us. We arrived at mid-day and were checked in promptly by a very pleasant receptionist who gave us a map of Barcelona and helped us with questions about transport and places to visit.The Clot Metro underground station is literally 2 minutes walk away and you are in the centre of Barcelona within 10 minutes and all the main attractions can be reached from here too. The hotel is ideally located as it is in a residential area although there is a busy main road at the end of the street.The hotel Albeniz is clean and the staff very pleasant, the breakfast is amazing for a small hotel and you can eat as much as you want. The rooms have a mini-bar fridge which is useful and satelite TV with Sky News and Canal+ which was great for watching Spanish football!We would definitely stay here again especially at the excellent price which worked out at 拢80 per night for the room and breakfast for 3 people and it is a good base from which to travel around the vibrant city of Barcelona.

<Content>Good 3 Star base for a City visit After reading some negative reviews of this hotel was worried about what we would find, after booking a 4-night stay; however was on the whole pleasantly surprised. We arrived at the hotel at about 11.45 p.m. to be greeted by the night porter who as well as giving us our keys spent time giving city maps and explaining how to get to the main attractions. Rooms are adequately furnished, modern with TV, air conditioning and a toilet and bath/shower off. I suppose they could be described as small but were adequate for our city visit. We did find that the wall/floor were thin and noise carried with ease, especially if; as one night someone decided to hold a party at 3 a.m. in the morning! Breakfast in morning was as much as you could eat buffet with cereals, juice, rolls, eggs, bacon etc., As other reviews have pointed out the hotel bar is basically non existent, however we found many local bar within easy walking distance. Clot itself is a small suburb community with many local shops and a market running a small 鈥榩romenade鈥? We actually found a shop selling Gaudi gift items for about a quarter the price of city centre ones. All in all we felt we the Hotel gave us an extremely good value for base for our Barcelona break.

<Content>More like a hostel than a comfy hotel. Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in March 07. Taxi from the airport cost about 鈧?0.A little disappointed upon our arrival. The reception and breakfast area are all in one room! There is no bar in this hotel. The breakfast was very disapppointing. On offer - peach juice, tea, coffee, cereals, cakes and pastries. Sounds ok when you write it down, but was all looking very sad and stale. They seemed to have run out of spoons most mornings.The room photos on the internet are very misleading. The room itself (a double) was the smallest, most cramped hotel room we have ever been in. When asked to upgrade to a bigger room, was told by the receptionist that the hotel was full, and the other rooms were of a similar size anyway. Wardrobe suitable for one persons belongings only. Nowhere to keep suitcase (if you kept it on the floor then that was all the available floor space taken!).The room had little natural daylight, as the shutter outside the window was broken, and couldn't be raised more than a quarter of the height of the window. Nothing to see outside anyway except a brick wall! We were at the back of the hotel, so our room was lovely and quiet to sleep in, with no noise from passing traffic etc. We had asked for a non smoking room, but the stale smell and ashtrays in the room suggested otherwise.The hotel info strongly advises that you use the room safe for valuables, but they do charge you to do this, and ask for a 鈧?0 deposit!The bathroom was shockingly small. So much so that you couldn't actually open the door to get in there, as the toilet was behind it.You could stand in the shower, clean your teeth over the sink, and flush the loo all at the same time!Was clean, but bathroom fittings a little dated.The hotel is within walking distance from the Segrada Familia. For all other sightseeing, Metro station Clot was just across the road from the hotel. It's easy to get a taxi from outside the hotel, we never waited more than a couple of minutes.This was our first time in Barcelona, so we asked the receptionist where to go for food on our first night. She recommended us to Port Olympico area. Very pretty as this was the marina, but sadly touts stand outside every single restaurant, and you cannot stroll without being accosted every 30 seconds. Not for us, so we left with empty stomachs and headed for the (less touristy!) Gothic Quarter, which had some great tapas restaurants. Despite several warnings about pickpockets, bag snatchers  muggings, we had no trouble at all from anyone, even on the Metro.Overall the rooms were suitable for single occupancy only, ok to use as a hostel to sleep in, but don't expect a sumptuous stay!

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Just back from a 3 night stay in the hotel with my husband. Very happy with the hotel. Very near the Estacio Nord bus station only 10-15mins in a taxi depending on traffic. Very close to the Metro Station Clot which we used every day. The hotel is within walking distance to Gaudi's Sagrada Familia but you need a taxi to get to the centre of Barcelona only around 鈧? one way. The hotel was very clean, fresh towels every day, very nice buffet breakfast with plenty to eat. The rooms may be classed as a little small but we spent little time in them. Our room was located next to the lift and the corridors had tiled floors so could hear everybody walking to the lift in the morning (A little noisy but then I am a light sleeper). The staff were very friendly and helpful. When we arrived the gentleman on reception asked us if it was our first time to Barcelona and then gave us a map and showed us where all the main sigths were located and the told us the best way to get around. I have a special dietary requirement and he translated some questions I had into Catalonian which I was able to use when we went to eat in restaurants. There are no restaurants or bars near the hotel so you need to go into Barcelona at night to eat but once in La Rambla there are plenty of choices. Avoid the snack bar on the corner near the hotel which we ate in for a quick lunch when we arrived, very poor food and way overpriced.

<Content>Nice hotel Found this hotel comfortable if a little sterile. We were upgraded from the hotel next door. Did hear a little noise in the corridor but not enough to disturb sleep. Generally the room was good but we did get 2 singles instead of 1 double bed. Breakfast was good with lots of options available. Location was fine - short walk from the Sagrada Familia. Would consider this hotel again.

<Content>Would not return While this was a clean, centrally located hotel I was disappointed with the experience. The staff were indifferent (three staff chatting at the breakfast bar, did not acknowledge guests at all). I must say that one of the reception staff was quite good, however, he was the only one of the four who was.The rooms have laminate flooring, which meant that when the people next door to us, above us and on the floor below returned at 2.00 am in the morning, we knew all about it!While not the fault of the hotel, some guests spent an hour running up and down the fire escape, yelling and slamming doors. After a guest complained, the 'gentleman' concerned was much quieter.I don't think I would stay here again.Please note that we stayed over a weekend, it may be much more pleasant during the week.

<Content>A bad experience The hotel is not in the center of the city and the rooms are too small, but the worst thing was a parking problem that nearly ruin our trip. When we got to there, we could not find place in the parking of the hotel, and the receptionist told us to park the car outside in the street. So we did it. The next morning, when we left the hotel to go to the airport , we could not find our car. It has been towed away. Parking was not allowed there , the traffic sign was not visible enough. So we had to go as fast as possible to collect the car and pay a fine. We got late to the airport and we were about to miss our flight to Roma. In summary, the hotel is far away from the tourist center, the rooms are small, and the staff is not helpful. It is not a place I would recommend.

<Content>Well worth a stay I stayed at the hotel albeniz for three nights in Feb. 2004 with my husband. It is a lovely hotel. Spotlessly clean, the room was very comfortable. Room service was excellent, fresh towels daily. Breakfast choice very good.A little far from the centre but near the Metro station clot. While we were in barcelona we were victims of a scam. Some substance was thrown from above on to us and a very well dressed pleasant man helped us wipe ourselves and kindly pickpocketed my husband of his wallet!! Watch out if you are going to visit Barcelona. The Manger of the albeniz was very helpful to us and we were very impressed by the concern of the hotel. Well recommended. We also loved Barcelona and wouldn't be put off going again.

<Content>Excellent value This hotel is very clean rooms appear to have been recently refurbished. Although a little outside the main city centre area, but only 50m from the metro - 'Clot' - so very convenient. The staff were very helpful - all round a good hotel, excellent value for money
