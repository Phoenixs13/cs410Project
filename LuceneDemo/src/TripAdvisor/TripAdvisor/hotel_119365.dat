<Content>Great little downtown motel 12/10/08 was my second stay at this little motel in downtown Phoenix. I found it because it is very convenient, (walking distance), to the US Airways Center where I was attending a second concert this year. The rooms are nice, very clean, neat, and bathrooms have new tile and good showers. The rooms have a refrigerator, microwave, and comfortable bed. Mangement is friendly, available, knowledgeable of the area and they even put out muffins, orange juice, etc for breakfast. Fantastic price for the amentities.
