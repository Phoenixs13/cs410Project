<Content>Wonderful Room Let me begin with the lobby - everytime we entered there were friendly staff greeting us ... what a nice touch. We checked in with no problem, and made our way through the nicely decorated lobby to our room (the lobby's intimate spaces make you feel comfortable - like you are in someone's home).The elevator was a little scary - you can tell it is the old elevator (they did try to update the look - but it still seems old). The elevator moans and groans as it travels to your floor.Our room was wonderful. It was very large .... it had a kitchen area with fridge, big comfy couch, HUGE TV, two queen beds. The previous reviews which mention the a/c are correct. The unit reminded me of the units in a Motel 6 - it was quite loud when running - but it wasn't really a problem for us. The bathroom is small, but there is a large area for dressing outside the bathroom. The vent fan in the bathroom was very loud, and it was annoying when running (which it does whenever the bathroom light is on). The noise drove my husband crazy. We were able to hook up a dvd player to the huge tv which the kids loved. Overall - this was a perfect room size and decor for my family (2 adults and 15Yr old and 10 Yr old). The only bad things to say were the a/c and vent fan - but those were minor issues. We did swim in the pool - it's nothing really special - just a pool. We did use the exercise room - very nice - tvs on exercise equipment.

<Content>Perfectly Fine with a few Gripes We checked in for one night. Our main beef was with the air conditioning. In our room, it was a wall unit placed behind the beds against the outside wall. We had two queen beds in the bedroom and a pull out sofa in the living room. I haven't seen one of these since I last stayed in a motel like LaQuinta. It definitely did not cool the room with the pull out bed where our grandson was sleeping.We did LOVE the large 42 plasma HDTV in the room. Best picture clarity of a hotel TV I've ever seen! Absolutely loved it. It swiveled around so that the living room and the bedroom could both see the picture.There was a very small bathroom, but we made do. The continental breakfast was very crowded, but we got our breakfast and were able to find a place to sit, and were on our way.Not the best, but not the worst either. I would stay here again.

<Content>Overall, not bad... but a few gripes! Nice place. Everyone seemed pretty friendly. Made our reservation online about a month before our trip to Dallas, but they couldn't find us in the system when we showed up to check in. The gal at the counter discovered after a few tense moments that we were in the other system. Not quite sure what that meant, but after driving for 9 hours, and being late for a wedding rehearsal, things weren't looking too good. She was able to find us on the other system after a few more minutes, and all was well. Room was nicer than expected and clean. 42 inch plasma TV was an unexpected perk. We were able to sneak in about an hour at the pool. Nothing fancy, but nice. Extra towels are located at the pool, so you don't have to bother with bringing any down from your room. So, plenty of hits! However, a few misses... Driving in Dallas is a rather odd experience, and you can only get in the hotel from one direction on the street, so keep your eyes peeled and be ready for a u-turn. The closet in our room was tiny. It was a small closet, with an even smaller door. We were able to squeeze in a few items, but not many. Another thing, couldn't get hot water in either sink. It was warm, but not hot (although the shower was fine). The almost disaster when we were checking in could have been really bad. If you book a room online, make sure to print out your confirm # and bring it with you. Didn't seem like the credit card used at time of booking was much help... Last but not least, I don't think the toilet was completely bolted down. It wobbled quite a bit when sitting down and getting up. Even noticed a wobble when I plopped my foot on it while drying off after a shower. You have been warned!

<Content>Disappointing Disapoointing by Hyatt standards.1) Breakfast room is way too small. Also the fruits were stale. The papaya stinked.2) Rooms have depressing brown, coffee and dull blue color scheme.3) Elevator inside was very old. Needs an uplift.4) Air conditioners make you think that you are sitting on seats near the jet engines on an aeroplane.

<Content>New Life to Tired Property This hotel is now a part of the Hyatt chain and is receiving a much needed facelift. Rooms are fully renovated. Construction is still underway in the lobby area. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with large plasma tvs...new beds and linens paint and carpet. Breakfast was included in rate, with cereal, toast, pasteries and eggs...Staff was attentive and very helpful with suggestions for restaurants, navigating traffic and so forth. Booked via priceline for 60 a night...well worth the money.

<Content>This place is a dump! I had NEVER stayed at any hotel as filthy as this one. As soon as we walked in the door, we noticed that the floor was dirty. Here's a tip, Amerisuites, if you're going to have a pop corn machine for your guests, please have someone clean up the mess left behind. I almost tripped on the thick layer of crushed pop corn stuck to the floor. Also, the breakfast area, which is right as one comes into the lobby, was still dirty from breakfast, even though it was 8pm! There were dirty napkins crumpled up on the tables and food crumbs everywhere. The room itself was NOTHING like the pictures posted online. For starters, the decor was old and dark, the stench of gym locker that emanated as soon as we opened the door was unbearable, the carpet was filthy with crumbs and it had stains EVERYWHERE. The room was very small, with the TV in the middle, so once in bed it was nearly impossible to see it. That is, if you can get into the rock-solid bed. The room is so small that one side of the bed is crammed up against the a/c unit. The bathroom walls were moldy, the floor was not clean, the toilet was stained, the towels felt like sandpaper and -here's the kicker- there were pubic hairs in our wash cloths! Even after all that, since we have two infants and didn't want to risk not finding alternate accommodations for the night (it was a holiday weekend), we decided to stay. Please, don't even think about having breakfast here! I know it's free, but please go to the Jack in the Box down the street and spare the $5. There were mold spots on the frozen French toasts that had been nuked solid, the once frozen waffles were still cold, the scrambled eggs were runny, the fruit had gone bad, and the boiled eggs were so hard they gave the term 'hard bolied eggs' a new meaning! They were like golf balls!! To top it off, the staff was rude and uncaring, and some didn't even speak English. PLEASE DON'T EVER STAY HERE!!!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel for Families or Groups! Booked this hotel for a trip for my teenage Girl Scout troop year-end trip to RainForest cafe  the Grapevine Mills Mall. We wanted something with room and additional amenities. This was a perfect fit.Reservation: After checking this site  the hotel site, I called the hotel directly. The agent I spoke with was very friendly. I booked 2 rooms and requested that they be connecting. The advertised rate was $129 per night. He asked me if I was with a group and when I mentioned it was for Girl Scouts he gave me a reduced rate. We saved $15 on each room.Location: The hotel was very easy to find. It is located at the back of the mall next to several other hotels, including Hilton, Homewood Suites  Springhill Suites, which is currently being built. Parking was free  very plentiful. This hotel is very near the Dallas/Ft. Worth airport.Check in: Arrived at 10:30 AM and stopped to see if check-in was possible. Normal check-in hour is 3:00 PM. The front desk (Ms. Fuentes) was very helpful. I had requested connecting rooms. These were not available at this time, but I was told that if I could come back a little later they might could find some for us. They offered to store our luggage for us, but it wasn't necessary. After eating  spending some time shopping, we came back about 2:30. They had saved the connecting rooms for us.Rooms: The rooms we received were great. Each room contained 2 double beds, which were very firm  comfortable. These rooms are min-suites and have a living room separated by a partial wall. The living room contained a sleeper sofa  chair, 3 tables  2 table lamps. I slept on the sleeper and it was ok, about normal as far as these go. Extra pillows,  bedding was stored in the closet area. There was also a desk with a chair  lamp. Also in the desk area, was a small kitchenette. This contained a small sink, small microwave, mini fridge, and even dishes  silverware. This was perfect for the snacks that we had brought with us. The bathroom was adequate with a toilet  bath/shower combo. A sink with plentiful space was just outside the bathroom door. Although near the airport, we never heard airplanes from inside the room. All was very quiet.Breakfast: Included in the price was a complimentary breakfast buffet. This had about anything you could want, including make-your-own waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage, cold cereal, pastries, fruit, milk, 2 juices  coffee. Even my picky girls could find plenty to eat.Social Hour: This hotel also had complentary social hour on Sun.-Thurs. We looked at it, but didn't stay. It seemed to included several snacks, as well as wine  beer.Pool: One great amenity was the pool. It was a nice size, ranging in depth from 3.5 - 5 ft. It was never crowded, so the girls swam both in the evening  the morning. The only bad element was the morning swim. When we went down to swim, the maintenance man had been called away  had left the cleaner in the pool. After waiting about an hour  checking with the front desk a couple of times, we were given permission to remove it. After this the girls had a great time.All in all we thought this was a great hotel and would gladly stay here again. For the location, price  amenities it can't be beat.

<Content>Very nice value for the money I was very pleased with the quality of the Amerisuites, Dallas North. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The continential breakfast was nice and included self serve waffle makers. The staff was professional and courteous. Overall I was very pleased with my experience. It isn't a four star property, but it is very nice and would certainly stay there on my next trip to Dallas. I recommend it!
