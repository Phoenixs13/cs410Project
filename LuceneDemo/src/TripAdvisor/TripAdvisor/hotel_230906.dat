<Content>Decent Hotel - Not so great location This hotel is actually quite an average hotel, but quite good for Amsterdam standards of budget accomodation, the rooms are a bit on the small side and the tolets are white, clean and a bit dull. The furniture in the rooms could definetly use some renovation. It's location has its ups and downs depending on what your purpose is in Amsterdam, if you are looking for something central, then skip this one as it is 20 minutes away by tram from Dam square. However the business districts of suth amsterdam are easily reached by tram. The area around the hotel is smart full of upmarket shops and some (not many) restaurants as well, but keep in mind if you are arriving late that the area is dead after 10 pm and if you want to get something to eat you'll have to go to the center of the city.Breakfast is good but seating space can be limited in the breakfast room so make sure you arrive early enough.Overall the hotel is average and a good choice if it can save you some euros.

<Content>Worked just Great for me I just needded a place to stay and got so much more. The staff went out of their way to make my stay the best.I was the only man staying in the Hotel for five days and all the others were women from all over the world. I did not pay any attention to the carpet because the price was just the best. I made so many new friends there I will never forget it.I was just looking for a nice place and some fun and I got more then I bargained for.SirDanniel

<Content>Not outstanding but certainly good I stayed in this hotel in February 2008 for a few days.The first thing they asked us at the moment of check-in was our credit card, and we were immediately charged for the total amount of our stay. I know that sometimes this might be the policy of the hotel, but I didn't like it.Anyway, the room we got was very clean, but was SMALL!!! Even our bed was not a king size(1.60mt) but a french size(1.20mt) because probably a bigger bed couldn't fit in that small room!!!There was no place were to put your luggage, not open nor closed, and the wardrobes were not enough if you had to stay a few days. I'm not even mentioning our bathroom. you had to be a tumbler to take a shower! However, I would like to point out that the room was CLEAN and it was cleaned every day properly.The breakfast was great, and there was always tea and coffee available for free. Internet was not free but it was certainly much better than in many other places.The staff was very kind.The location is simply great, everything is easy to reach by tram from where this hotel is.

<Content>Out of the ordinary experience We stayed here on business and the staff were very helpful and friendly. only a 10min walk to the WTC and 10min tram ride to Leidseplein. While we were staying there I became quite sick and stayed at the hotel during the day. They were renovating during the day. I had loud drilling noises vibrating through the rooming I was trying to sleep and recover in and I ended up in tears in my pajamas down in the lobby crying that I was sick and couldn't sleep. They immediately let me call my Mum in Australia for 20mins for FREE, moved my fiancee and I from our small 1st floor room to a large, airy rooftop room twice the size that opened on to the roof and had a rooftop view across towards Beatrix Park. I could sleep in peace without hearing any noise and the staff told me that I could go down and use the coffee machine whenever I liked. They also supplied me with a kettle to make myself soup. What a surprise for my husband when he returned back from work! I would stay here again if they weren't renovating or I could have that great rooftop room! Staff were lovely people, especially Cliff.

<Content>Awful, looked like someone had died in the room We were staying in a large group and arrived last at about 10pm. i dont know if this had any bearing on the room we were allocated but the room had what looked like old blood/ rust stains all over the carpet. As we went out for a drink almost immediately on arrival it wasnt until midnight we got back and i noticed stains showing through the bedsheet. I foolishly pulled back the bedsheet and noticed the bed was covered in blood stains. We didnt want to complain because there was so many of us but I did afterwards, i would never stay here again it was disgusting. Best Western have apologised but its put me right off! Amsterdam on the other hand was lovely which was just as well.

<Content>Very good Hotel This is a great little hotel - the staff went out of their way to be helpful -we would definately stay here again as it is only a 5 minute tram ride away from the centre and is in a lovely clean part of town. Ignore the previous reviews about 'worn carpets' etc and just go for it. For a city break it's ideal. Highly recommend.

<Content>carpets need replacing Just returned from Amsterdam 2 weeks ago. I had requested a triple but only got a double-but the staff was quick in bringing a cot to the room. But it made it rather tight in the room. The carpets in the corrider are horrible and in bad need of replacement..but the room was clean enough and the staff pleasant. And yes the tram is right outside the hotel and very noisy. Breakfast was great.. a grill and the fixin's so you can fry up your own bacon and eggs plus other breads and rolls. It's in a safe neighborhood and as long as you don't expect alot it's fine.

<Content>Very disappointing I do NOT recommend this hotel. The room was clean but corridors looked worn and dirty. Bathroom was terrible - small and not functional. When someone walked through the corridor my bed was shaking. Sound insulation of the door was equal to 0 dB! And of course there were problems with my bonus points. I will not stay there in future.

<Content>Way too expensive for the service offered We were totally disappointed with this hotel: the room was a good size but the carpet was in desperate need of cleaning if not replacing. The bathroom was one of those that you could use the loo and brush your teeth at the same time...very very small! breakfast was very poor, should have been a buffet ...yeah, if you call that two slice of cheese, ham and overcooked eggs, let alone the coffee or tea... I would not recommend it, you can find much better hotel closer to city centre at a lower price. By the way, we checked out a day earlier and booked in somewhere else!

<Content>Not Bad, Great Location I was given a very large room for single occupation. Very comfortable bed. The carpets were a bit grubby.Breakfast was slightly below average. Not much choice - and expensive. The lift button on the ground floor frequently didn't work. We all had to share two big tables.The staff were friendly enough.Beethoven street is excellent for shopping and had some good restaurants especially a top-class Chinese close to the hotel.I would only go again if the rates were cheap.Vic March 2005

<Content>Enjoyable Stay Had a pleasant stay at this hotel, staff were very helpful, breakfast was good. Room had a light that needed attention and this was repaired promtly. The location was near the City about 20 mins by tram and 10 mins by taxi. A nice quite location not too far away from the action.

<Content>Great find outside Amsterdam city center If I were touring Europe and had to stay outside a city center once, I'd do it in Amsterdam in this hotel. The neighborhood is great and the tram that stops outside the hotel is quick and frequent. If you get a room facing the street (like I did), that same tram may keep you awake, but that was the only complaint: my room were big, comfortable, and clean and the staff was terrific.

<Content>AMS Beethoven - A great little hotel We stayed at the AMS Beethoven for 4 nights in March - loved the hotel, loved Amsterdam. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The morning we checked in, after an overnight flight, they hustled to get our room ready - by 9am - so we could anpe before hitting the city. The staff ws consistantly helpful with directions, suggestions, etc. There's a great supermarket next door, as well as a terrific bakery. The breakfast was fine - coffee excellent - and the common breakfast room was a good place to connect with other tourists. The hotel in not lavish but in a great, high-end neighborhood. The cable car stops a block from the hotel, so you can be in the center of the city in 10 minutes, yet get a bit of a feel for how real Amsterdamers live. There's a great, neighborhood Greek restaurant, Kriti, Balthazaer Floriszstrate about a 5 min walk away- towards the Museum section. We would stay there again if we can get back to Amsterdam.

<Content>Can't beat the location-basic but clean hotel Just back yesterday from staying at the AMS Beethovanstraat (though they are now a Ramanda). Its a basic hotel -carpet and decor is very worn but the rooms are clean, the staff is helpful and the breakfast has enough of an assortment to please most tastes. A little advice when checking in indicate you want a room located at the front of the hotel. They first tried to give us a tiny room at the back (saying it was quietier) but has a view of the garbage bins. The large rooms everyone is talking about in their reviews are all at the front of the hotel-Beethovanstraat is busy but quiets down at night. Plus you want a city view,you're in Amsterdam, after all. The location is perfect since trams make everything only minutes away and is a nice relaxing way to see the city.

<Content>As long as you don't expect luxury, this one fits the bill Don't let your expectations get to high - this is definitely just a basic 3 star hotel - the carpets and fittings look a bit work but it's clean and has all the essentials. The staff are friendly and the best thing about is the location. It's on a very respectable street and there's a tram stop practically outside the door - and it's sooh easy to get around by tram.

<Content>Wonderful hospitality and amazing staff. My wife and I spent eight nights at this warm hotel. The rooms are much larger than most hotels in the centre of the city. The location is very convinient. However, the best assest the hotel has is the STAFF. Everyone from the reception desk on was warm, friendly, courteous and very helpful. It truly felt like a home away from home and it made all the difference to come back to the hotel after a long day of screenings and meetings at the documentary film festival. One of our colleauges fractured her wrist - they arranged for the hospital. I had a cast on my foot - they called the museums to see if there were wheelchairs availabel. prentations needed to be printed out - they did it without any fuss. They gave great travel tips and suggestions. Kudos to the management - they know what it means to keep their staff happy - it makes all the difference. Do stay here.

<Content>The vacation of 9 baths.... On my 4th trip to Amsterdam I stayed here. The reason was to try staying out Damn Square for a change. Well let me tell you, I wish I had done that sooner. Its so much cooler, cuter and more real of a experience. The staff was the BEST! They were like my Dutch How to buddies. The hotel had no AC and it was hot in the Summer, but the bath room... ! It had a 6 1/2 foot long bath tub. The train to the square was only about a 10 min ride, and it passes so many cool places it was wonderful just to step off and explore. The staff told me that this hotel is in the Cool part of town, what ever that means. Right next door is a cute coffee shop (with out drugs folks), and next door a grocery store, bakery, drug store, and so on. LOVED IT! Stay here, everyone, no matter what.
