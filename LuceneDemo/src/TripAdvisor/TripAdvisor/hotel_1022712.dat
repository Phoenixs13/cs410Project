<Content>From Hell to Heaven I think it resumes our thinking of barcelona's hotels.Hell, fake pictures, wrong location on website, long walk from car-park and personnal not really willing to take responsability for that. That麓s how starts our romantic holidays.We could not stand it and went looking for anything else, litteraly.Heaven, that's a Curious thing. Reception helpful and nice, at 2am the personnal made us a tour of the hotel to get away our suspicious mind, we were conquered with the great clean designed room they proposed, we enjoyed the variety of the included breakfast and had a good night sleep in a quiet area, even that close from Las Ramblas.The prices are a bit high, but it's personnal. We are more hostels travelers but after what we had, it was so good that we decided to go for it.For breakfast I like daylight and the dinning room of this hotel only has artificial light, but hey ! Even heaven is not perfect. Boy, if it is, means your dead !Hasta la vista, Curious!Sector9

<Content>A great find! We went searching for an alternative hotel after our original booking turned out to be almost 1.5 hours away from the city centre. After trying a number of hotels along La Rambla, we came across the Curious down a side street - and what a find. It's within 5 minutes walking distance from La Place Catalunia and about 15-20 minutes stroll to Port Vell - so a perfect spot, close to the famous market.This hotel is clean and well decorated. It's a 1* so doesn't have some of the extras we would normally like - such as tea/coffee making facilities and the breakfast is simple but as a base to enjoy everything Barcelona has to offer, it's great! We stayed for 3 nights out of the 4 we were away for and were moved from the very small 'double' to a twin room at the suggestion of the staff for the last 2 nights, when the room became free. The doubles are very small, so I'd recommend trying for a twin. The three staff we met were all great, helpful and informative.Definitely one to recommend.

<Content>Well recommended Modern hotel in the centre of Las Rambles. Stayed here for 6 nights and was very impressed with it. Very clean and tidy, Staff were very friendly,There are only 2 faults, 1 There is no bar as stated on the website you can get beer from a vending machine but nothing else.The other, tea/coffee facilities in the room would have been nice.Would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>Basic but v. modern, clean and superb location Stayed at Hotel Curious during the Sonar festival and have only good things to say. It's at the cheaper end so you know it's not going to provide luxury, but you hope it will be clean, quite, comfortable and have polite friendly staff - and all these hopes we're fullfilled! We had a room on the street side a few floors up, this gave us a small balcony from which to observer the constant activity of the narrow, atmoshpheric, typical-of-Barcelona Carrer below. With the French doors closed and the aircon on we couldn't hear any commotion. The bathroom was also very modern and clean.Arguably the greatest asset is the hotel's location though, on the slightly less touristy side of La Ramba. The streets here are lined with odder shops, restaurants and bars and there is far more real life and atmosphere on this side than on the more touristy East side where the Cathedral is. The huge food market is just round the corner as is the MACCBA centre of contemporary art. And there are loads of places to take advantage of a menu del dia sitting out on the pavement.So if you want a cheap hotel that is everthing a cheap hotel should be and is superbly located, give this some consideration.

<Content>Excellent hotel My husband and I recently stayed for 1 night after moving from another hotel in Barcelona. The hotel was very clean and had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable, although we opted to take the only room that was left which was a single room so it was tight, but our choice. The hotel is fairly new so it is very updated in both design including a television in the room with international channels and internet access in the lobby. The breakfast was good, with pastries, coffee, etc. The hotel is also in a great location just off of the busy La Rambla. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona.

<Content>Great hotel Hopefuly we found this very nice hotel, just 30m from Ramblas, in a walk downtown Barcelona. This hotel saved my honeymoon, because I had booked a terrible hostel believing in fake pictures in a hostel website.The rooms are quite comfortable and well designed, LCD TV, international channels, very nice bathroom and shower. The breakfast is included and is simple and delicious. The staff is also very kind. My wife and I loved this hotel.
