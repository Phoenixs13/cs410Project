<Content>great hotel During my stay in Mexico City, I stayed at the Marriott Reforma and the JW Marriott. Both hotels were great!The Marriott Reforma is in the Zona Rosa area. It was recently remodelled and has been open one month so everything is nice and new. I did not have a room with a great view; there's construction going on, however, this was never ever an issue as the work didn't begin until maybe 9am and actually was not loud. I want to stress that I didn't find this an issue like in some places I've stayed in where construction is taking place. I stayed here during Christmas time and the hotel was very empty, but I would not hesitate to recommend staying here.This part is important - when taking a taxi, most drivers are not familiar yet with this property name. Just tell them it's located where the Hotel Aristos used to be.

<Content>Brand new, Great Hotel... Still working out the kinks.. Stayed there for three nights recently. Got a decent rate of $200/AAA. The hotel is fabulous. Everything is brand new very high tech as the previous poster indicated. The gym is fabulous, everything was brand new in the exercise room and they have a whole spa. The gym occupies almost a whole floor and I only used the machines but they had a small pool (outside and not heated) and a Jacuzzi. The hotel has only opened a few weeks ago (my guess is early December 2008). However some of the staff indicated it had not been inaugurated officially so it was some sort of soft opening. The staff is very helpful although they are still not completely up to speed and some things take a little while. For example I charged my taxi to the airport to the room and it took them almost 20 minutes to do my checkout. However staff is very helpful. They have their own La Mansion restaurant on premises with a great view of Reforma avenue. The building is only 12-15 stories high as it was an old hotel that was converted (Aristos). However I believe they gutted everything as it appeared brand new all around.Actually I suspect I may have been the first guest to occupy the room I as in 1209 as the TV wasn't wired properly. It would turn on but not change channels. I am technically inclined and checked the wiring and found out the hotel control box was connected to the AUX port instead of TV port and fixed this. This indicated to me that either I was the first guest in the room or they previous guests had not used the TV which is probably unlikely. Did room service a couple times and they were quite helpful. My MR points haven't posted in over a week so I suspect they may have issues with their systems due to being so new.Please PM me if you want additional tips.

<Content>Small but perfectly formed! An aside. I ended up here because I tried to book into the W in Mexico City and their booking service was so terrible I gave up!The new Marriott (open less than a week when I was there) has a stunning lobby, very enthusiastic staff and fairly small rooms. But don't be put off by the small rooms, they make incredible use of the available space and are probably the most technologically advanced of any hotel I've stayed in (i.e. put your ipod in the alarm clock docking port and it will wake you with your favourite tunes!). As such, you need to let the bellboy explain what everything does in the room, because you'll be amazed.This hotel is right by the Zona Rosa, so good for restaurants, bars etc, as well as being central (if such a thing exists in DF) for business.Bad luck W, I won't be trying to book with you again, but will definitely return to the new Marriott.
