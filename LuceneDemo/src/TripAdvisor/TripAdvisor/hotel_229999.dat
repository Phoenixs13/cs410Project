<Content>Staff a bit indifferent This is a small but adequate hotel near enough to most Barcelona attractions. The price was good for a big city but beware that if breakfast is NOT included in your hotel price it is outrageously priced (17 euros per person). Nowhere in the breakfast room did it tell us that price. Rooms are small but nicely appointed and have higher quality amenities than most Best Westerns. Although there was no coffee maker in the room, room service delivers coffee and tea at no charge. The hotel has a small restaurant (separate from the breakfast room) that was a bit more reasonable for lunch or dinner but was no great shakes.My major complaint was with the staff. They could not answer basic questions about where to find travel necessities. Also pickpockets are notorious in the area and after my husband was hit by one (they didn't get anything but they spill some crap on you that looks like vomit or bird doo and then offer to help you clean it off as they pick your pockets) the hotel staff gave us a safety sheet that warned of this. When he asked why we didn't get it at check in the clerk said the manager didn't want to 'scare' business people by giving it out during the week so they only give it on weekends. There is free internet and it worked well but the staff had only one converter plug and it was checked out to another guest for an extended period of days. The staff couldn't tell us where to buy one.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Dante We have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona having stayed at the Hotel Dante. I would just like to say what an excellent Hotel it was. Everywhere was spotlessly clean and all the staff were most helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We had adjoining rooms 412 and 413 and they were perhaps the best we have ever stayed in. We cannot comment on the restaurant as we always ate out.Breakfast in the Hotel was very good with plenty of options and was constantly replenished. The Dante is in a nice quiet area.The only negative side to the Hotel is that it is nearly 5 blocks (20 minutes steady walk) to the nearest Metro station (Diagonal).Apart from this though I would recommend Hotel Dante to anyone visiting this great City.

<Content>Good No Nonsense Hotel Hotel Dante was an excellent 4 star no nonsense hotel, in the sense it just delivered what it promised.Good location not very far from main attractions in Barcelona and also near the famous Red Bus lines which are really good to see the city as such.The brekfast was excellent and i really stayed at a 4 star hotel after a very long time but to tell you the truth this hotel did not make me feel even for a moment that i should have stuck to my luxury selections.The bed was extremely comfortable and the morning breakfast was excellent.The tall gentleman at the reception and the blond lady were specially very good as were most of the other staff at the hotel.Would like to look at other best western properties in the future after my experience at this hotel.If i had to have a negative for this hotel was that this hotel is not very near a metro station but thats ok as its not very far too.Barcelona in general was a great city and this hotel was a real value pick.

<Content>Very good hotel This 4-star hotel is located within walking distance of many of the Gaudi buildings--a real plus. It's also close to the main shopping streets in town, plus one of the best Tapas bars in Barcelona--Cerveseria Catalana. The rooms are comfortable and well-appointed, and the breakfast buffet very plentiful with lots of choices. The personnel in the breakfast room are wonderful, and the blond woman at the front desk--very helpful.Our main and only complaints--the bathroom sink where the faucet did not quite reach the sink fully, so that whenever the water was turned on, much of it ended on the counter or floor, and the bathroom shower head was placed in the middle rather than the end of the tub, which made for very awkward showers.

<Content>Very nice hotel visited for a short break. Had been worried about general standard of hotels in Barcelona after reading other reviews for many of hotelsadvertised. Hotel Dante is modern and well furnished. The whole hotelwas exceptionally clean with good room service. Staff were polite and helpful when aproached for information. Breakfast was self service buffet with wide range of good quality items including champagne. All items constantly replenished.Very little outside noise. Walls were quite thin and only noise came from other guests when shouting, singinging or moving about. Bedrooms were not the biggest but were certainly adequate,comfortable and well appointed. Location is about 15 miniutes walk from Placa Catalunya and Ramblas. Well served with restaurants and bars nearby. This hotel was a good base fro Barcelona and made for a pleasant and stressfree base. Wouldcertainly use again.

<Content>Great Hotel I have just returned from 5 days in Barcelona and a very pleasant stay at the Hotel Dante. Staff were very friendly, rooms were nicely decorated, bathroom looked great and it was all kept very clean. Tea/coffee making facilities were not available in the room, but were free via room service 24/7.Breakfast was lovely with a great choice - although I didn't eat the cooked so can't comment on that. Great selection of everything else though. We regularly used the Metro to get about - very easy and cheap. The closest Metro station we used was Hospital Clinic and was about 5-10 minute walk away.The only downside was that the internal walls were pretty thin and not great on soundproofing - but it was all pretty quiet at night - so it would not deter me from returning. We did also get natural daylight from the window - unlike some other guests that have posted a comment on here!Well, I would go back....great location, clean, friendly staff, good price! I booked via [--]Hope it helps!

<Content>Excellent Hotel, ideally located We have just returned from a 3 night Barcelona break, we are independant travellers and had booked the hotel and flights online. We arrived just after midnight to find a bright, clean and inviting reception with English speaking friendly staff. The room on the third floor was well equiped with 2 beds, mini bar (that we used for our own drinks), air conditioning, safe, clock and TV. the seperate toilet and bathroom were clean, tidy and obviously regularly maintained. The room also had a balcony, though this was not furnished.Breakfast was available in the first floor restaurant, or free room service was offered by simply completing a menu card that was left in the room by the maid.The hotel is 5 blocks from the nearest metro station (Provenca) and the whole area has a feeling of calm and safety about it. In summary - a well kept easy to get to friendly hotel.Barcelona city is a great short break destination with plenty to see and do, however I was targetted 5 times by pickpockets and I can't stress enough just how vigilant you need to be.

<Content>Not good The hotel has a good location but thats about it for good points. The room was tiny, and very dimply lit with just two tiny lamps. The window opened to a tiny little inside yard which got no sun, so there was no direct light at all coming in - rather depressing. The walls seemed to be paper thin, as I could clearly hear discussions and all other activites from other rooms, including when someone used the toilet or even switched their lights on. All rooms seemed to be also very close to the elevators, which add to the noise. Bathroom window opened to the dark elevator shaft! The hotel staff was pretty friendly, and spoke passable english. This does not compensate for the shortages in the room. I cannot recommend this hotel as it is not even inexpensive.

<Content>Do not go to this hotel!!! Do not go to this hotel!!!I booked by phone, to be sure I won鈥檛 get a little smelly room in the basement (I already experienced that in other cities..), I asked for a room at higher floor, and that is what I got - actually, the room was at fourth floor, it was small, and smelly, the window opened to a patio covered by a yellow glass three floors above 鈥?without any direct light. , bed was of poor quality. Room was also very loud, you could hear every word spoken both in corridor and in adjacent room. The window from the bathroom looked at the pipe tunnel. You need more? The description of the location as Hotel gives it is definitely misleading, it is a good half an hour walk from Catalunya Square.Choose any other hotel but this.

<Content>5 day break The hotel is one of the nicest we have been to.The room was on the 7th floor,clean,well laid out,and quiet.The minibar was well stocked(though pricey)and cable tv -worked on every channel including english news channels except the one channel for english movies/soaps etc.But we didnt go to barcelona for the tv.The bathroom was spotless and very eco friendly in its laundry service-bravo!No tea/coffee making facilities in room but reception were more than happy to provide this service when asked.The lifts are small but do work effectively.the rooms have an outer and inner door which cuts down on any noises.We found the breakfast was limited in its hot foods eg.scrambled egg  fatty bacon only.There were many cold buffet dishes including cheeses/hams/smoked sausages/cereals/fruits/yoghurt/rolls/croissants/bread/pastries etc.which were excellent but more in keeping with warmer weather.Reception is accessed via main entrance and up a short flight of steps(wheelchair users be advised)Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and all its services/amenities.We would happily return to this hotel and recommend it to anyone not wishing to stay too close to the ramblas area(10 minute walk).There are plenty of places to eat and drink near the hotel and if on a tight budget loads of small cervezarias who sell cheap beer/tapas dishes.

<Content>On a loud main road I stay in a lot of Best Western hotels in Europe and this one is good but I do not believe it deserves a Premier rating.Our room was an okay size and very clean but over looked the main road below which made sleeping with the window open impossible. The bathroom was good and again very clean.This hotel is about a good twenty minute walk from from the top of the Rambles and about a ten minute walk from the nearest tourist bus stop. The area seemed very safe and there were some nice bars and restaurants around the hotel, the small Jazz bar across the road was quite but very cosy.

<Content>Very nice, reasonably priced My husband and I stayed here for two nights while in Barcelona. We booked this hotel because a previous hotel we had reserved was so terrible that we refused to stay there for more than one night.Staff were friendly and accommodating. Room was set up with a second internal door, which kept sounds from the hallway from entering the room. Compared to other hotels in Barcelona, this one was very reasonably priced. While not fancy, we felt it was worth the price. The breakfast in the morning was quite nice, though not included in the price of the room.The location is a bit out of the way, but all of the cab drivers know this hotel by name (which was not the case with the two other places that we stayed), which made getting around a bit simpler.We would absolutely stay here again.

<Content>Nice hotel Nice hotel, very clean throughout. Enjoyed the breakfast (I normally find breakfast disappointing in Barcelona, but not here).My room was very clean and comfortable. There was a lobby with a seperate door into the bedroom, helping to cut out corridor noise. The window looked into the central atrium and did not allow me to ascertain the outside weather. It also restricted the natural light, the room would have benefitted from improved lighting to counteract this.I chose the hotel because it was not directly in the bustling centre of town. I tend to find the more central hotels to be extremely noisy at all times of the day. For this reason, the hotel was ideal.Overall, I would recommend this hotel. The staff obviously take a lot of pride in their work.

<Content>Dante Hotel I am an American traveler and as you may know, we like our hotel rooms spacious. This one was right in the middle: not large enough, but not as small as most Parisian hotels have. When booking, try asking for the room not adjacent to the elevators. This rule works for ALL European hotels, not only for this one. Stuff was 50/50: some very friendly and some just there to perform basic functions.Location....If you are planning on walking a lot around Barcelona's architectural gems and shopping areas, it is a pretty good walk. For the airport transfers is quite convenient. As somebody already pointed out here, the Aerobus is a short walking distance away. But again, like in a case with me, if you have a lot of luggage, it won't work. The best part of this hotel location is Cerveseria Catalana (hope I spelled it right) is situated on the same Mallorca 3-4 blocks away towards the city center. Cheap great food and beer. Always packed with locals. Don't take a table, get situated by the bar and talk to the bartender directly, they all speak good English. It is also fun to watch them work. As a general rule, do not get breakfasts at any hotel (unless it is included in your stay). Get outside and buy better food for 3-5 Euros per person instead of 13-15 at the hotel. Enjoy your trip!

<Content>Never again! checked in late at night and was really shocked: the room was small and smelly. the only window looked to a patio which was covered with a roof. so no direct light, and very loud (you could here every word and tv station from the other rooms)!but the most terrible experience: the window from the batchroom looks in the elevator tunnel! so while trying to sleep it sounded like the elevator is going through your room.i tried to get another room, but no chance. 'every room looks the same and no one ever complied' was the rude answer.by the was, the location also is not very good. and the 4stars are for ... no idea!

<Content>Away from the action, highly recommended After spending a lot of time researching various hotels for location, accomodation and price, my Wife and I finally went for the Best Western Dante. Prior to booking I also contacted the reception to confirm my requests, and they were very happy to oblige. As the previous post, it is situated away from the main action, but this was one of our main requirements - nothing is too far away by foot, rail or bus. The Metro station is under 10 minutes away and as everyone knows, the city is out there waiting to be explored. We arrived relatively late from London Luton, not touching down until 5pm local time. After reading about the RENFE engineering works from the airport, we took a taxi direct ot the hotel - a cost of 22 Euros, well worth the expence. Upon arrival, the reception staff were very friendly, spoke good english, and we were shown to our room - top floor, front facing, double bed, non-smoking . . . just as I had requested. We also had the bonus of a balcony, an extra room a bit like an study/office, having no rooms above us, and none either side due to the layout of the floor - Room 703. Breakfast was adequate with hot/cold buffet, it saves searching around the local area first thing in the morning for something to eat. Room was well presented, clean and all the normal amenities one would expect from a Best Western hotel. A Supermarket was situated next door which was very convenient, local cava and strawberrys went down very well in the evening. Highly recommend a visit to this hotel if you want to avoid the more central areas, I'm glad we did after walking past some of the names I had looked at during my research. We caught the Aerobus back to the airport, only a 10 minute walk way and no complaints about the service and price - 3.75 Euros per person. Finally, the Sagrada Familia is on the same street as the hotel, and only a 20 minute walk away - what could be easier.

<Content>pleasant, friendly small hotel Surprise visit arranged by my wife for my birthday and we were also accompanied by our two daughters and their partners. We all liked the Dante. Although slightly away from the bustling centre of Barcelona to us this was an advantage in order to be away from the noise of traffic and late night party/club goers -even the young couples (all four around thirty years of age)were happy with the location. Within easy walking of The Padrera , which in our view is a must to visit,up market shopping, a number of very pleasant restaurants ( The Dante only has a snack bar menu apart from breakfast) and two or three Metro Stations on different lines. Room very clean and well presented and of adequate size for a short break. Slightly disappointed with the bathroom - perfectly adequate but a little 'musty' with there being no extractor fan or windows and it was possible to hear 'noises off' from the next room bathroom. This was occupied by our daughter and her husband ( is that a good or bad thing?!!) Hot and cold buffet breakfast very acceptable with a variety of choices to suit visitors from various nations. Staff some of the most helpful we have experienced when travelling, particularly at reception where nothing seemed too much trouble. Some improvements being undertaken at the hotel when we visited but they were were neither unacceptably noisy nor disruptive. Would heartedly recommend this hotel for a short break to all but those seeking late night entertainment or the clubs and bars of central Barcelona

<Content>Good value, quiet hotel within walking distance of main attractions My wife and I stayed here for 3 days in October 2004. We were booked in as a surprise by her work as a performance related bonus so we did not know where we were going. When we got there we were very impressed. The hotel was clean and tidy with well presented and friendly staff. The rooms were a little small but were perfectly adequate for a short stay. They were well equipped with everything you could need and reception were very helpful if you'd forgotten anything. Breakfast was a continental buffet and there was plenty of it. The hotel is situated in a quieter area of the city but only a 5 minute walk from the main shopping districts and 10 minutes from Las Ramblas. In all a very good hotel, looking forward to going back next year.

<Content>Good standards A good standard hotel, in a quieter location but still within walking distance of Las Ramblas etc. I think some of the most centrally located hotels can leave you feeling exhasted from the sheer huslte and bustle of being in a very central location - not so this place, I could feel myself winding down on the walk back. Having now been to Barcelona a number of times for a break I am becoming used to areas beyond the very centre and I would certainly use this place again. Rooms were of a good standard, reception was helpful and the whole place was very clean. I experienced no problems at all.

<Content>Fair Hotel I spent last weekend visiting Barcelona with a friend.I normally use a Best Western Hotel and am normally quite satisified however the room was very small, the lock on toilet not working, no ironing board as promised, no safety deposit box, and a lot of street noise together with the rather long walk to the city center dampened my love for this hotel chain. Staff are quite friendly however. I was very dissapointed with the cold breakfast which is meant to be a hot breakfast. I will not be staying there again although will go back to beautiful Barcelona.Also I have a Best Western Points card which the hotel refused to add points to and told me to go back to travel agent. Booking my travel over the internet this was impossible. Heading to Frankfurt Germany this weekend, wil not be staying in a Best Western hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel I stayed at this hotel in June, 2004. It is well located in the less touristy area of the city - but within walking distance of all places of interest. The hotel decor is very traditional - lots of wood and plush carpets. Stayed in a double internal room - nice and quiet for afternoon naps. Big bathroom. I would stay again altho I do prefer hotels with a more contemporary feel. Staff excellent and efficient.
