<Content>Amsterdam Trip We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in late december. It was better than it looked from the outside! When we arrived at the hotel it looks a bit like a hostel with lots of young travellers staying there. The outside looks ok, but made me feel wary about what we would we get inside. I was quiet surprised, the rooms were large clean and the beds were big! The rooms was a bit sparse, but I wasn't there for the room! The bathroom was a bit small but the shower was big and had a huge shower head and plently hot water! Breakfast was ok, it was continental with enough choice to keep even the most fussy person happy. The staff were always helpful and willin to be of service. We did have a few issues with the safe not locking and then not unlockin the next day but this was soon sorted out. The hotel is not in the centre of Amsterdam and you will need to take a short bus or tram trip to the centre. Which can be a bit of pain if its cold and yu just want to get to bed after a long day walking around. This hotel is perfect for those looking to keep their budget down but still stay somewhere nice and clean.

<Content>OK hotel, but Amsterdam? Not for me This was an OK hotel, we are a family of 4, the hotel room was clean and reasonably large, but it was bare - a table with some chairs would have been great. The bathroom was reasonable. The hotel was quite a distance out of the city and you had to catch a bus to get in and out. If you are travelling with your family, the location of the hotel is an advantage. After you have been walking around the city all day smelling the hash, it is very pleasent to go somewhere where the air is fresh.Amsterdam is the sort of city you visit once and never visit again, it has very little to offer - you may think that all the best artists came from there and you can visit galleries and see this great art, unfortunately none of it is there. Hotel was OK, city was very disappointing.

<Content>Disastrous breakfast room This hotel is about a 20 min tram ride out of town and convenient to get to. There are also various bus routes, etc. but you will need to email the hotel for these. The front of the hotel can get noisy when tourist buses are there (trundling cases, engines, etc.). I was moved to a room at the back (ground floor windows do not open) which had a lovely view of a skip full of dirty rubbish bags. The furniture is dark and retro. The padded chairs seem to have been recycled from another hotel and are scruffy. The building seems like a recycled office block. There are no door numbers 鈥?just handwritten ones on sticky tape. There are gloss paint streaks every so often on the carpets. The rooms are clean and bearable but there are no instructions r.e. the phones, etc. All phones are blocked because of tour groups, so check at reception if you are a solo traveller. Plumbing can be very noisy. Overall, it is bearable.The worst thing about this place is the breakfast. There is a limited selection of badly prepared food (stale muesli, cheese hard at the edges, bacon in a puddle, etc). The coffee machine blocks every so often. There seems to be no dining hall manager. There is no trolley to clear the tables so that each table cleared means a separate trip from the kitchen. For people who want to fix their own packed lunch the lack of supervision is a gift. We watched one family of 4 adults make a loaf of sandwiches plus umpteen packets of jam, biscuits and liver pate and they weren鈥檛 the only ones.I was very surprised to find that this hotel was a Best Western.Good reception staff but overall badly run, lack of attention to detail and un co-ordinated.

<Content>Amsterdam stay Lovely bed and shower-most important!. Very helpful staff. Close to trams and busses. A fair way from the train station. Good wholesome breakfast. We had a good big room, very quiet.

<Content>Great hotel, would def. recommend We visited this hotel as a stop-over on our Contiki tour. The hotel does look a bit dodgy on the outside but looks really are deceiving!!The hotel is beautifully new and spotlessly clean. The rooms were all very modern with enough space to put your baggage down- which is something to say for hotels in Europe.The location isn't exactly ideal, but it isn't too far away from the center.

<Content>True Blue (how cheesy) Stayed here just one night, as noted in the earlier reviews, the hotel is fairly ugly from the outside but once inside it is a really nice 3 star hotel. There were a few works still going on but they were no problem and did not affect us. The rooms are furnished with what seems quite expensive furniture though not really my taste. It was almost like antique furniture. Staff were nice and the girl who checked us in spoke 4 different languages to different guests all very fluently. I would def recommend BSH it was a bit of a trek out of the city but easy enough. Take the 13 or 14 from centraal sit back and relax. Its not that far.

<Content>Blue Square Hotel, Slotermeer, Amsterdam The hotel was very clean, even though they are currently still building. It's very new!Had a twin room, again very clean had daily room tidy which included fresh towels.The room had 2 beds, a T.V which had plenty of channels to choose from even BBC 1 and BBC2 for us English.The breakfast they had on offer was ok.. nothing special but i think thats just because it wasn't what were used to, had a choice of cereal, bread, scrambled eggs, fried tomatoes, cold cheeses and hams and fruit.There is a supermarket just across the street from the hotel, and another smaller shop which opens very late.. i don't know the exact times of the shop but it was open at 2am one morning so its quite helpful if you arrive or have to leave early.For location the hotel is a bit out of the way of the centre of Amsterdam, but the public transport was brilliant, tram stop just outside the hotel door with a tram to Dam Square every 15 minutes and cost 2.40 a single so is cheap and very easy.Getting there we got a train from the airport to the Central Station and a taxi from there to the hotel.. The taxi cost 20 Euros which was quite expensive but we didn't get there til late so was the easiest and quickest way.Overall i'd suggest this hotel if you don't mind being slightly out of town, but we did walk into the centre, took about an hour (although we did get a bit lost!!) Nothing to complain about, the staff on reception were very helpful with any questions, spoke good English which is very helpful if you don't speak Dutch!!The wireless connection wasn't available but we assumed that was due to how recently they opened their doors and haven't finished building yet.Lovely place to stay, i will be going back next time i go to Amsterdam, i just hope the prices are still as good!! :D

<Content>Scary blue building The first impression of the Blue Square Hotel is: what a horrible blue building. But do not let you scare off by the outside. This brand new building is nice and airy. The rooms are spacious and clean, the breakfast was good and the staff was really very friendly. This hotel gives you definitely value for money
