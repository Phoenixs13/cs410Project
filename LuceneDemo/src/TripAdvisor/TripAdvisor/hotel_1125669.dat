Artistically perched on the edge of a ravine, where below; the sacred Wos river tumbling through its rocky course; a panorama of the high terraced rice paddies. MICHI hopes to provide discerning travelers with Bali's rich culture as well as general wellness of mind and body. This creative, wellness village is a retreat for every creative soul, infused closely with the local, authentic village life. The village people painstakingly labored its 8-year construction and development

<Content>Artistic and Spiritual Paradise in Ubud area Michi is a unique, beautiful, playful retreat center/resort which stands apart from the usual hotel/spa fare in the greater Ubud area.Sitting on a ridge over a river, looking out onto terraced ricefields are its rooms and villas, each with a unique character and style. The entire place is an ongoing work of art for its founder, a retired professor/diplomat/world traveler who has cast each room in the image of a place he has lived around the world (mekong, india, japan, even a throw-back room to the 1950's in the USA!). This place is the meeting of Gaudi and the New Age. It is both beautiful and has a deep sense of humor. There are rooms and platforms overlooking the rushing river for yoga and meditation. The place is as unique as the life of The Professor, its founder. We found Michi Retreat online, thought it was interesting, worth checking out. We found ourselves in an astonishing wonderful place, with special touches, great food, and had the privilege of making a special friendship. Yes, it is not the 4 seasons, and yes there are some rough edges, but what it is cannot be duplicated anywhere in the world. We're accomplished world travelers, on our third trip to Bali in 30 years.....This is a great place for your personal retreat, and is also a great space to go with a group of friends or fellow participants to do inner work,
