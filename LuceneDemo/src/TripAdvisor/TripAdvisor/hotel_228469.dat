<Content>Never try this hotel, 1 mistake is enough I do not think it's a 4 star hotel at all, it's a big lie.I had a terrible experience there:- Room: small, no fridg., empty of everything, tv useless, cannot open windows, noisy, walls like papers, no isolation, can hear your next door easily, internet very slow....etc.- Bathroom badly isolated, could feel the fresh air from outside which was very unpleasant in the early morning)-Windows are single layered on the back side of the hotel.No need to say that I will never go back to this hotel.AVOID CATALONIA ATENAS HOTEL BY ALL MEANS.- F.S.Canada

<Content>Not more than OK Stayed at the hotel with 2 more family members during August.Reception didnt seem to know English very well.The rooms are very basic. The couch in the room was filthy.Bedsheets were fairly clean but the matresses seemed old.The third bed in the room was very uncomfortable and narrow (as if it was for kids).The rooms are not quiet. Everytime someone opened or shut a door , the room shook. You could hear people talking in the next room and you can hear their TV as well.Breakfast was ok, not very diverse.The only good thing I can say about the hotel is it's excellant location. It is literally 1 minute from a Metro station and about 10 minutes from a very nice mall near the Aqbar tower. It is also about a 20 min walk from Sagrada Familia.If you don't mind a low standard hotel this is a good place to stay.

<Content>Not 4 star I had booked this room at Catelonia Atenas because it was cheap for a 4 star...was 4 star for 2 star price. But it was indeed a 2 star.Our room was small, about 1/2 foot from end of bed to table, but was not a problem. However room tends to get/feel very dusty all the time, in spite of daily housekeeping.It was not exactly close to Sagrada Familia as advertised, you would see the distance when at the rooftop pool, but it is just in front of Clot station, which then makes it easy to get around.This was my 2nd choice as the hotels at La Ramblas was fully booked and having little homework of the place, did not settle for any of the surrounding areas (Barri Gothic and Passeig de Gracia - which would be just adjacent to La Rambla - maps make them look far, or Colon Square is fine too). My take is, if you can't get La Rambla, take the other 2, the location saves you time and money commuting on the very efficient metro (credit given), which could go to the round the clock shopping.

<Content>Nice stay but be aware of overbookings ... Was there last August for 3 nights, with my familiy and some friends. Booked 3 rooms on internet and received an email confirmation from the hotel. The hotel seems to have major overbooking problems as a couple of hours before the triple room check in i called the reception to confirm (just in case ...) that everything was ok and they told me that the triple room was not available due to overbooking so they were trying to find an alternative within Catalonia hotels. After a discussion they proposed to replace the triple with a double and a single which was acceptable for us as they charged the same price. Noticed other people at the front desk complaining for the same reason.1) Positive: it isn't in the city centre but still close to main attractions. 10 minutes walking from Sagrada Familia and 30 minute from Old Town. In front of the hotel there's a Train Station and a Bus Stop so it's very easy to get anywhere in Barcelona. Around the hotel you'll find some restaurants, pubs and shopping but better go to Old Town, Old Port or Gracia District. The rooms are standard for a 4 stars hotel with comfortable beds/mattresses, cleaned and a nice decoration thus as the bathroom with a nice look, functional and adequated amenities. At the lobby there is a bar open till midnight with a smoking area. Internet is also available but isn't cheap (try the Internet Cafe in front of the hotel). Breakfast is rich buffet based with lots of cold and hot choices. They also have show cooking which is mainly grilled bacon and eggs. We paid 84,50 鈧?for a double which is a great price for the hotel value, although the breakfast was not cheaper (+- 13 鈧?per adult and half for a child).2) Negative: a 4 stars hotel can't have overbookings, particularly an hotel chain. It's unacceptable! Breakfast is excelent but a bit expensive. Right next to the hotel there is a nice cafeteria where you can take a great breakfast for much less. Also the parking is paid and the price is abusive for hotel guests (19 鈧?/ day) but we didn't have many alternatives around.

<Content>We Felt Invisible A warning to people from Ireland  U.K., if you like drinking tea don't stay at this hotel. This might seem trivial to a lot of people, but these simple services build the foundation of every great hotels success and this hotel lacked a hell of a lot of the basics, making our stay very uncomfortable and we will think again about hotels in general in Barcelona. Apart from the aforementioned tea debacle, the room service was a joke, 2 tea pots in the whole hotel (lets see, thats 9 floors with about 25 rooms a floor, do the math, thats a lot of people with hot water, let alone tea!) The reception ignored you unless you were part of a coach party, which they seem to have a lot of.P.S. The Swimming Pool....I think I could build a bigger one out my back garden and it was freezing cold, whats that about?

<Content>Nice hotel, rooms quite noisey though Very nice hotel, made a very good first impression. Very keen, and friendly talkative staff (although talking the receptionist talking to the people behind us in the queue in preference to answering out questions was a bit too much). The room was quite small but very well appointed with a generous bathroom w/ hairdryer etc. Swimming pool is tiny, but the view from the top is great, plus plenty of seating if you wanted to relax in the sun... would be a nice place to go at night, but unfortunately closed at 2130 when we were there.I'm normally a heavy sleeper but the doors must have been very thin since I was frequently woken by people walking along the corridor or the room cleaners. Didn't appreciate being woken by the cleaning lady at 9 am on Sunday morning dispite displaying the Do Not Disturb Sign. Top tip: the baguetteria next door is very good, and a lot cheaper than the hotel breakfast (didn't try the breakfast so can't comment on comparative quality).If it wasn't for the noise and being woken on Sunday morning (we were there 4 nights, I don't know why Sunday was any different) then this would have been excellent value for money. Unfortunately sleep is the main reason you need a hotel, and so comes out rather average because of that.

<Content>Loved it!!!!!!!! Hotel in ideal location, just round the corner from the Metro station (Clot). Staff really friendly and very helpful. Breakfast was excellent with a wide choice. Hotel was very clean and there was a treat on the roof with a lovely sun deck and swimming pool. The pool is small but much needed after touring the City on a hot day. Would definitely go back - absolutely fantastic!!!!!!

<Content>1.5 thumbs up My wife and I recently stayed in this hotel over the holiday season. I think the hotel had recently been renovated. The rooms were reasonably sized by European standards with a separate bathroom. Overall the room and bathroom were clean and the room was made up every day. Fresh towels were provided each day but the bath was never cleaned. Plenty of hot water and a very good shower in the bath. No real complaints here. The staff were very friendly and cooperative and most spoke good English. Probably the highlight was the breakfast service, which was outstanding with a huge variety of hot and cold breakfast items offered. However, don't eat dinner at the restaurant. The menu it very limited and the food isn't very good. The hotel isn't really situated very close to most of the tourist places, e.g., La Ramble, La Familia, or the beaches, but the metro system is great and close to the hotel (station Clot) and taxis are cheap and numerous. Overall, this probably isn't truly a four-star hotel but quite adaquate and clean.

<Content>Would not return to this hotel I booked a room for 8 nights on recommendation of an event organiser for a forum I was attending in Barcelona.The first room I had was a cubicle and that was quickly changed to a decent sized double-room when I remonstrated.It is close to Clot metro and that makes it easy to get around town, it has a room-top view on the 11th floor with a swimming pool, though it was too cold to use.The housekeeping was bad, at one time the housekeeper literally went in from of me at 19:30 to clean a room I had vacated since 7:30 in the morning.The Do Not Disturb sign seem to mean nothing to the staff, twice my room was walked into and twice also, someone had remove the signs from all our doors on a Sunday morning.If you are not in a group, think of using restaurants in town rather than the hotel. As business traveller, this hotel is more 2* than 4*.I would definitely not return to this hotel or any in the hotel group - it was definitely not home away from home.

<Content>Recommended - good out of city centre location Stayed here for 4 days over Easter 2007 (myself, husband  12 year old son). Rooms functional rather than overly comfortable, but staff friendly  helpful, breakfast plentiful and great location for exploring. Opposite metro station (Clot) and couple of minutes walk to mainline station (El Clot Arago) - we took the train back to the airport which was much more fun (and loads cheaper) than a taxi! Once we had purchased a metro travelcard there was no stopping us, and it was quite good to get away from the centre after a busy day/evening out. Also walkable to Sagrada Familia and we walked back from Arc de Triomf once. Hotel was busy because of Easter (bit chaotic couple of mornings at breakfast) but relatively quiet the rest of the time. Only problem was the weather which was appalling! Suggest you take jeans and jumpers even in April! Would definitely recommend if you want to save some money on city centre hotels, and yes would stay there again.

<Content>Recommended :-) Couldn't fault this hotel or staff. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and the location. Walking distance to Sangrata Familia (?) and right beside metro station. Metro so easy to use and only 5 stops into the centre. There are also shops around the hotel and a good shopping centre about 10 minutes walk away. Breakfast in the hotel was super with lots of choice. Ate in the hotel one night which was lovely. Quiet and lovely staff. Found every member of staff mannerly and helpful - so much so that I wrote to head office and the hotel manager complimenting them. Would definitely go back again.

<Content>A youth hostel masquarading as a 4 star hotel I booked 5 nights at this hotel through Expedia. Reviews were mixed but gave the general feeling that this hotel was decent enough. The deal I got through expedia was quite good, and it included breakfast. So my fianc茅e and I headed to Barcelona, rather excited at the prospect of staying in a 4* hotel, close to the city's centre. Staff were friendly and efficient. Breakfast was good enough, with quite bit to choose from. That's the positive side of things... On the downside, first the hotel was heaving with spotty school teenagers, who would return from clubbing at 4 am, shouting on the top of their voices. It was obvious the hotel was catering for schools, certainly to fill up rooms during the low season. Too make matters worse, the insulation in the rooms was quite appalling. It felt like the guests in neighbouring rooms were actually in the room with us, chatting, snoring and using the toilets! And as the cherry on the cake, the furniture was not even worthy of Ikea. We had a cheap bed that unfortunately gave way on night one, even though we weren't up to any rumpy pumpy naughtiness on that particular occasion... So I wouldn't advise anyone to stay in this hotel unless they came equipped with ear plugs and a toolbox. Save your money and go to a youth hostel instead. You may not get the smiley staff and nice breakfast, but it will be as genuine a staying in Hotel Catalonia Atenas!

<Content>Fab family friendly Stayed with my wife and two year od daughter. Hotel is very clean and staff very friendly. We had not ordered a cot but on checking in the staff were very helpful and within ten minutes a maid came to the room and set up the cot.Room was of a very good standard and was very impressed by the large size, with enough free space for another double bed. The only down side was the single glazing which did let in some of the noise from the street, but it was not that bad.Buffet breakfast was excellent and staff very attentive.The location is ideal for access to the city centre with a metro station accross the road.All in all a very enjoyable stay, would reccomend this hotel highly.

<Content>Enjoyed the Atenas We went to Barcelona as part of a group of 8 and, having read some of the previous reports, I was more than a little concerned about our projected stay. It would appear that the Hotel has made huge improvements since some of those reports were submitted. We found all the staff to be extremely helpful, The check in staff / receptionists all speak excellent English and were very approachable. The bar is small but well stocked and very friendly bar staff help improve the ambience. Our room was excellent, immaculately clean and well stocked. The breakfast costs 10 Euros extra but comes in the shape of a very well stocked hot and cold buffet. The food was excellent. We stayed for 3 nights ( Fri, Sat  Sun) and enjoyed it. They have clearly worked hard to improve from the bad reports they have received in the past. We found the hotel ideaaly placed to explore the entire city and we intend to return to visit. We would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Wonderful stay Three friends and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights over the Whit Bank holiday. The food was wonderful we even stayed in for dinner on a couple of nights - there was so much choice at a very reasonable price. Very close to the Metro and only a short journey to the centre of Barcelona. Our one regret was that the pool was not open but otherwise an enjoyable trip - perhaps the staff could have been a bit more cheerful but they were very helpful. The green light (very necessary) was barely visable and the screens cut out all the traffic noise - we would go again.

<Content>Totally disagree with bad reviews I booked a staff trip for 10 to Catalonia Atenis for a holiday weekend. I didn't read the reviews until after the booking so was dreading it not being up to standard. However we were pleasantly surprised. My room was very clean, no smells and some of the rooms were very spacious. I couldn't believe it when I saw the green light on the smoke alarm that someone in a previous review said kept them awake all night. It is a tiny sensor light (grain of rice) and if flashes approximately every 20 seconds, if you blink you would miss it. In fact I would never have noticed it if I hadn't deliberately looked for it. The breakfast was excellent. In fact I have stayed in many hotels and have not had such a selection to choose from. Something for everyone. The only disappointment was the pool was shut . Would definitely use this hotel again as very handy for the metro also.

<Content>No Sleep Here! The rooms have a green light in the ceiling which flashes all night long. It is a smoke alarm but stops you getting to sleep as it is right above your bed!There are also wooden laminate floors in all of the bedrooms, which means that you can hear every step above, below and to the side of your room, also making it difficult to sleep.I complained about a broken shower/bath attachment on the first day of our stay. When we left five days later it had still not been fixed.The Hotel staff seemed fed up and were unsmiling and unhelpful.I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Noisy, not at the center and old rooms We stayed here 3 nights at January of 2003, and they placed him on the second floor. Was impossible to sleep there because the noise of the street.After we talked with the staff, we get a room in the 8 floor, a little quieter, but the room was very poor. Small and old. For me this is not a 4 * hotel.Avoid this hotel (if you can)

<Content>Avoid the Atenas Hotel In hindsight, although we are aware that the city has limitless sights, we should have made do with a long weekend rather than a week. That being said, we booked the Atenas hotel without much investigation first. They pupport to be a 4 star hotel which as you know, means nothing abroad. It was far from 2 star let alone 4. The main problem is that the front of the building is on one of the main feeder highways into town ( 4 lanes each way ) and it is rarely quiet. The second and most infuriating problem are the early morning chambermaids, who go out of their way to make a lie in impossible. We asked for a room move and were advised with a straight face that there was many bad rooms in the hotel !I rest my case. Avoid like the plague.

<Content>DO NOT STAY at Hotel Atenas in Barcelona I strongly agree what other people said in the review. It is not a 4 stars hotel. None of the picture in their website are real. The lobby is old, staff is unhelpfull. Not to mention the room, it is small and the air condition is not working at all. When I asked to exchange to another room (due to poor air condition), their staff show very annoyance and did it very unwillingly.I strongly suggest not to stay at this hotel. It not even deserve a 1 star.

<Content>Horrid...cancelled on arrival On arrival this hotel is situated on a very busy main road. Having never visited Barcelona before we wasnt expecting this. The hotel made us wait 1.5 hours for our room as it wasnt ready. We waited for 20 mins in the bar/cafe area to be served a drink, but ended up getting 2 cans from the lobby drink machine as the bar/cafe had no staff and we gave up after asking reception twice. The roof terrace was closed even though it was a warm and sunny day. The lobby looks nothing like the website/brochure pics and the staff we did encounter were very unhelpfull. This hotel is by no means the 4 stars it rates itself. We cancelled our room and checked into another hotel. Stay somewhere else!

<Content>This is not a 4 star hotel The outside of the building is grey and uninteresting like a 60s block that should have been refurbished. The twin room was no more than 7 feet wide and 7 feet long. We stayed for 6 nights which meant the 1ft wide walldrobe with 18in storage area was not big enough to store clothes. The windows were filthy and the bed covers was full of tiny burn marks. The door to the corridor was ill fitting and everyone coming and going could be heard. The breakfast was fine - plenty of selection but the juices were actually very week squash. The pool was tiny and cold and the terrace was dirty and tatty. There was a crane that constantly swung over the terrace which was very frightening. The lobby looked like the underground waiting area with vending machines and a row of seats bolted together. There were no smiles from the reception staff just an efficient issuing of keys and invoices. The phone in the room was broken and the towels were clean but very thin. The lifts kept breaking down and as we were on the 8th floor this was very inconvenient. This would not make a 2 star in England. I think the hotel must have awarded itself with 4 stars nobody else would.

<Content>Great view from the rooftop pool I recently stayed at the Catalonia Atenas with my wife  two teenage children [2nd week of august]. The rooms were fairly small, but reasonably well equipped with TV  air con. The buffet breakfast was good, with a wide choice  more importantly, the ability to help yourself . [ The waistline hasn't yet recovered !]. Without a doubt, the best feature of the hotel, was the pool, although it was small, it was a great way to cool off,  the views of the Barcelona skyline  in particular the Sagrada Familia were excellent.

<Content>nothing like the pics the atenas doesnt look like the pictures. in the picture of the lobby there are big leather couches and its all clean and fresh and very luxurios. well this is rubbish, there are horrible grey plastic seats like a subway and its unclean. the bar isnt great and very expensive. the vending machines are pricey too. then the rooms- some are very small and some of the air condioning doesnt work. and i got a tiny room with a tiny dirty window looking out onto wooden scafolding, some of the tv channels are very fuzzy. now for the buffet and breakfast - ok, i give them credit for this , as the food is of good standard and its hot , but its hot inside and theres no fans. on some sites and in the brochure they show you a pic of the swimming pool and the sun terrace. in it, it shows lovely green flooring all neat and tidy with big plants and clean sunloungers and nice white patio furniture. no way. its dirty and it looks out onto horrible dirty bulidings with lots of cranes doing buliding work. and the furniture is crap. and the sunlongers are of poor quality. i recomend that you look around a little more for a hotel. this is definatly not as good as it should be. im dissapointed and appalled. email me if u have any qestions. i will be happy to answer.
