<Content>Very nice It was a very nice hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. As well, the hotel was in a safe neighborhood and there were always lots of people walking around. The hotel was quiet, clean, and very nicely decorated. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>What a Great Place! My daughters and I spent the weekend. We had a great time in Seattle. The hotel was very helpful with directions, coupons and town car service to the airport. The Happy Hour at the Dragonfish was exceptional - great prices, great food, great service. The room was very clean and beautifully decorated. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nice, but several issues The hotel was under exterior renovations, but that worked out for me as I was out of my room for most of the day. The rooms were completely renovated and tastefully done.The biggest issue is that upon going to bed the first night, I noticed an overpowering smell of urine in my bed. Stripping the sheets, I found a fairly fresh urine stain that made me want to vomit. Luckily, I retired the second bed in my room. I notified the front desk to make sure it was cleaned at some point. My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up. Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well. The wireless bill did not get charged to the bill, you had to enter your credit card for it. Never ever seen this in any hotel I have ever stayed at. Very annoying. Also, the restaurant downstairs I assummed is affiliated with the hotel, but the bill gave you no option to bill it to your room.

<Content>1st class noisy If i spend close to $200 per night, I would like to think that I dont have to hear the person in the next room urinating and flushing. that is on top of the street noise, the restaurant noise, the garbage collectors, etc. Despite a sleeping pill and earplugs, I didn't sleep well on either of the first two nights and the third night I was awakened by the dreadfully intimate sounds of someone in the bathroom next door or above.

<Content>Generic Unremarkable Chain Hotel How chosen:The Grand Hyatt was fully booked the week end. This property was not and is directly across.Pros:* Safe and (relatively) quiet neighbourhood. Brisk walk to the Paramount Theatre, Pacific Place and the Public Market: pretty much Tourist Central.* Yellow rubber duckie in the bath tubCons:* At approximately $320 per night, it is not good value for money* Entry is awkward through a side door off Dragonfish, an Asian themed restaurant that is the facade of the hotel. Hotel Signage itself not immediately obvious from a distance.* Unremarkable uninviting lobby (with fire place) that resembles a vestibule* Only one (1) elevator seems to be working/responsive at any time - prolonged waits.* Concierge matter-of-fact rather than someone who will find alternatives or make suggestions to help with your stay. He shares his desk/duties with the Bell Captain.* Check-in staff unpolished and in in-training mode. I am not looking to take tea with them, but some pretense at enthusiasm, courtesy and/or warmth is welcome for the weary traveler.* Rooms are adequate but not roomy with a giant flat screen telly forming the frontispiece. My room had a spectacular view of some rooms in an adjacent office building and large windows of a steak house. Close your blinds if you do not look good naked.* Generic toiletries evoking kitchen scents (which is all the rage).* No exhaust in the toilet.* Small shower stall with no light within - an option would have been to combine the bath tub and shower. Shower head in my room was not adjustable if you were other than four and one half feet in height* No morning newspaper delivery, but there are three (3) copies of the local paper at the front desk, depending on how early you rise.* Limited coffee making supplies, insufficient for two (2) guests. Coffee was thankfully generic and not Starbucks.* No leaflets directing you to various local tourist sites, just matchbooks for local dining options.* Insufficient power outlets in the room* Sheets were unironed * Insufficient storage space (for given price point and considering this is not a boutique hotel in Europe)

<Content>Room 315 HORRIBLE!!! I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms ! Also, huge light is right outside window and shines very bright into the room. Otherwise, the Hotel is in a good location for sightseeing and shopping..

<Content>Excellent staff and nice rooms I was booked into this hotel for business. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The hotel was recently renovated and is really nice. The rooms were clean and I forgot an item and was able to get it back from the front desk staff.DragonFish, the restaurant downstairs was good too.I highly recommend it if staying downtown in Seattle.

<Content>Great place to stay This is our third stay at this hotel. We live in the Seattle suburbs, but love to stay here when we spend the night in the city. Yes, there is alot of construction in this area, but the noise level is LOW and is not even noticable until about 8:30AM and stops about 5PM. This would be the only reason I can not give it an Excellent rating at this time. This hotel has a homey, elegant lobby and the decor in the rooms are quite nice.... cherry wood, flat screen TV, granite tops, and comfy bed. Parking is $25. a night and we have never had problems with the valet parking. The attendants are quick and courteous. There is a restaurant attached (The Dragonfish) which is very good and has a great late night Happy Hour. We love the location. Just a block away is the Pacific Place Mall with lots of eateries and higher end shops. West Lake Mall is just a couple more blocks down the road. The Paramount Theater is across the street and there are always wonderful plays and music  comedy shows to see. There are two closeby movie theaters, many restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, Ruths Chris Steakhouse...), many places to have a drink (Von's is a favorite), all within walking distance. Pike Place is about 7 blocks and makes for a nice walk. We will be back!!!

<Content>Fine If You Don't Pay Too Much A friend and I shared a room for one night in late Dec. 07. There was an online special of $129/night, which included valet parking. The room was plain and average-szed, but clean and comfortable. The location is very good, in the thick of shopping and restaurants, halfway between Pike St. Market and Capitol Hill. A nice touch- there's complimentary internet computers off the lobby and the hotel's restaurant, Dragonfish has good sushi/pan-Asian food if you don't want to go outside in the rain.There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine. And don't pay more than $129/night for a room, there are better deals out there in the higher price range. For the price I paid, I was perfectly content and I'm surprised about all the bellyaching in previous reviews - maybe they paid too much.

<Content>Started good...ended terrible My wife, one year-old son and I stayed at the Paramount for two nights over a weekend to attend a family wedding at the Hyatt across the street. The location is great (ten minute walk from Pike Place Market) but construction in and around the area means you're forced to use valet parking ($25/night). Our first day and night at the hotel were great. Room is decent and clean. The cleaning staff is very friendly; the frontdesk staff and valets are OK. The in-house restaurant is mediocre but not too pricey. Things started to go terribly wrong on our second night. Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom. A cleaning staff person caming to our room and plunged the toilet, but the toilet plugged up again the next morning. This time a real maintenance person came and fixed it, but noone came to clean the floor like we requested. The manager knocked off $50 for that incident. We then called down to have our car retrieved from the valet upon checking out. They could not find our car for about an hour! We nearly thought our car was stolen! Still not sure why our car could not be found for that time. Meanwhile our son was tearing up the lobby. Needless to say we left the hotel very frustrated and upset. We found out afterwards that the manager took off the second night room charge and parking from the bill, but the damage has been done. Even though rates are half that of the Hyatt, maybe go to a better hotel with better service.

<Content>Yup, it's bad... Ok, it is bad. The room is shabby, the shower made a horrible noise whenever the water was running. Sounded like a jackhammer. Valet parking was terrible. Did not want to leave our car there. Tons of construction in the neighborhood which starts at 6:30 am. Staff was rude and impatient. The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me. A long walk back up hill from Pike Place Market to the hotel. And the price was too high for the quality of hotel and service. Live and learn.Booked our hotel before reading reviews on Trip Advisor.

<Content>Much worse than expected This is the first time I have written a review of a hotel, although have used this website multiple times to make hotel selections. My work made the reservations and the website made the hotel look very attractive, so I did not question it. Bottom line, I do not recommend this hotel.The hotel is in a great location to shopping, restaurants, etc. That is the most I can say for it. As previously stated, the hotel hallways smell like cleaning supplies. The hotel room was very dark (even with all the lamps on), bedding and draperies were old and dingy, the carpet was filthy and spotted, and the entire room just smelled musty. The size of the bathroom was similar to what you would find in a lower priced motel but I found hairs in the basket where the washclothes and shampoo were located. The clock did not work on the radio so had to call maintenance to replace the clock radio. Spend your money elsewhere and have a better visit to Seattle than I did.

<Content>Convenient location, not a great hotel I did not enjoy my stay here. If you are on a budget and the other hotels are too pricy - Fairmont, etc - then this will work for you. But I thought the staff were unprofessional and I was uncomfortable with the men at the desk. I was put in a room that just didn't have the feeling be being fresh and clean. It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window. The only food available is from a Chinese restaurant that is in the hotel. I didn't try it, but it doesn't look appetizing. Based on my overall experience I could not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Was hoping for more We've always enjoyed our stay at the Paramount Hotel in Portland, OR. So when family members were visiting us last month, we thought we'd spend a weekend with them at the Paramount in Seattle. The location was excellent (near downtown shopping as other reviewers have mentioned). Staff was very courteous and helpful. Compared to the Portland location, the Seattle Paramount needs some sprucing up. The elevator was marked and scuffed. The hallway to our room smelled of cleaning or toiletry products (we couldn't tell which). There appeared to be some water damage in our bathroom. However, our room was clean and quiet. It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.

<Content>Nice Hotel I was in town for business and booked the hotel through my corporate travel agency. My rate was $142 a night which I found to be a great value. It was a great location and within walking distance to a lot of the tourist attractions and businesses. My room was clean. The front desk was very helpful, I had a 6:00 AM flight and they arranged for transport to the airport. The hotel restuarant, Dragonfish, was good. They had a happy hour every day with good drink and food prices. I would stay there again. Given the location and price, I would rate my stay as above average.

<Content>Weekend tradeshow in Seattle I stayed at the Paramount June 1-3 in conjunction with a trade show at the convention center. Great location for conventions and an easy walk into the heart of downtown. The room was OK, typical hotel room with queen bed, desk, TV, clock radio, coffee maker. My room was warm and I discovered the fan was on, but the A/C was not. The thermostat was worn so you could not tell which setting was A/C and which was heat. It was sunny and 85 degree temps; needed the a/c after hauling materials to/from the show. They use energy saving compact flourescent bulbs so the room was not very bright for reading. Definitely needed the curtains open by day. I found the front desk staff to be very helpful, though the bellman gave me incorrect info when I asked where I could find a DHL office. Ate dinner at Dragonfish, the restaurant that shares space with the hotel. They seemed to draw a local crowd as well as some hotel guests. Food and service were very good. I did not use room service. If you have a car, parking is $25 night. The trade show arranged a negotiated rate so I did not compare rates with other hotels in advance. My two night stay with parking and taxes was $389. Overall a good value for a downtown hotel in high season. Not fancy, but offered exactly what I needed.

<Content>Disappointed With Paramount My boyfriend and I ended a Northwest vacation with two nights at the Paramount. While the location is ideal (we walked to a concert at the Showbox), the hotel was not. I expect more for $200+ a night for a standard room.Room and bathroom were small, especially the bathroom. Everything was clean, I'll give it that, but there was something impersonal about the place. The website's pictures make it seem nicer than it is.We had a friend stay with us the first night there. No extra charge, which was nice. But, the staff left the rollaway in the hallway instead of actually bringing it into the room, leaving us to our own devices.Again, the best thing about the place is location (walking distance to Nordstrom Rack, tons of other shopping, etc.). If you walk away from downtown a bit, past the highway, you hit a really cute neighborhood filled with bars and restaurants. Can't remember what it's called.

<Content>Nice hotel for conferences This was a repeat stay for us, this time to attend a conference (previously on vacation). It is only a block from the convention center and not too far to walk to the Public Market as well. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. USAirways had delayed our luggage and the front desk staff were able to provide assistance (and sympathy). The upgrade to a corner room is worth it for the additional view and light, especially if it is a typical overcast Seattle day. The rooms were well appointed (shower and jaquzzi tub) and had wireless Internet for a fee.The Dragonfish restaurant downstairs had good food and okay service.

<Content>Clean, comfy, great price ... exactly what we hoped for. It was easy to find street parking (so we didn't need to pay the hotel parking rate). 3 of us stayed in a room with 2 queen beds very comfortably. The only thing was that there was construction going on right across the street that woke us up before 9am on a Monday morning.

<Content>average rooms; below average room-service I just returned from a three night stay at the paramount. The location was pretty good, we could walk to almost all the downtown sites we wanted to see. The bed was very comfortable and the lobby staff friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, room service wasn't as good. One morning, it took us 45 minutes to get silverware to go with our breakfast. By the time someone came back up with it, the food was cold. We were told that the restaurant manager would call us but no one ever did. Upon checkout, we had to ask, for the third time, to have the breakfast charges removed. One tip: if you want english breakfast or earl grey tea, don't order it from room service. It'll cost you $3.50, they don't bring sugar or cream, and you can get the same bag of tea in the little coffee maker kit in the bathroom for free.

<Content>Good Location, Room OK, Staff Clueless! This hotel is probably one of the best in terms of location for shopping and restaurant etc. but the staff are a bit clueless. Every time I called down to the Front Desk with questions it felt like I was putting them out. Their tone of voice was no better than a 13 year old with a bad attitude! Not to mention when I checked in they yelled my room number out to me, not a good idea as a female travelling alone... The back breaker was when I called the concierge asking what time the mariners game started that day as I had tickets, he told me 7pm. When I got there at 7pm the game had been on for one hour as it started at 6:05!! Pretty basic information for a concierge to screw up on! When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30. I called down to the front desk to find out what time housekeeping would be coming by as I wanted to have a nap before I went to the game. Their answer was they can come now or not at all as they leave at 5pm, how that was my problem I am not sure as they had all day to clean it... The restaurant was great, the service alright... The food was awesome and the prices are pretty good. Over all I would probably only stay here again based on location alone, it would have to be a good deal as well or I would stay at the Vintage Park or Pacific Plaza hotel.

<Content>Both good and bad I was more than pleased with my room, which was called a king suite I think. It had a marvelous bath (jacuzzi) tub and shower, nice bath products, comfortable bed and wonderful windows that opened all the way. It was also extremely clean. Really it was a great room and pretty reasonably priced for what I was getting. The TV was good, there was an interesting, decently priced minibar and a free paper, a good gym that was open 24 hours a day (which I love, I hate limited hours on recreation facilities, what if you can't sleep?) I kept thinking the whole time I was there that I was getting so much more that the guests at the Grand Hyatt for a much better price. They are across the street from each other.I had room service for dinner and for breakfast, both provided by the adjoining Dragonfish restaurant (Asian Fusion). Dinner was terrific, huge and hot. I think I ordered some chicken dish with noodles and vegetables (I don't remember what it was called) and it came with a salad. I also had a fancy cocktail which was tasty. I'd been there (to the Dragonfish) before, it's a really fun place for drinks. The breakfast wasn't good at all, undercooked french toast and missing strawberries, would not order breakfast again. I found the food to be quite fairly priced for room service and it arrived quickly both times.The lobby is very attractive also.What I didn't like about this hotel is the staff. They are clueless and not that nice. The person checking me in (may have been his first night) was alright but not that friendly. The person checking me out made disparaging comments about the person that checked me in and kept answering the phone and helping other people when she wasn't done helping me. She was supposedly more experienced than the other front desk employees but seemed incabable of issuing me a credit for missing items (from room service). It must have taken me twenty+ minutes to check out and I was pretty much the only person needing assistance. There was another person there, he was much nicer but seemed to not be that savvy with the computers. There was also a dispute with the woman at the front desk about a complimentary bottle of champagne (it states in their in-room about hotel information book that it's included in the price when you get that particular room), she said that it was only for people getting a certain package but that isn't what their book says. I didn't really need the champagne but I really didn't like her attitude, like I was making it up or something. She is definitely not an assett for this hotel. The main issue was getting my Coast rewards points for my stay, nobody seemed to know when they were to be awarded and the front desk lady didn't want to help me at all, she wanted me to call the 1-800 #, I think the other gentleman finally said that they would take care of it for me but I just checked and it wasn't done. I stayed there May 20th and it's now June 11th. So I did call their main Coast rewards # and that person said it should be fixed within 48 hours but she wasn't very nice either, making me not to keen to stay at a Coast hotel again. The server who brought my dinner was extremely nice and enhanced my positive experience but I think she worked for the restaurant.

<Content>Awful At midnight the attendant could not find my reservation, even though I provided a confirmation number. He had me wait for an hour while he assisted other guests. He was very rude and would not let me use the phone to call other hotels for vacancies. Later the manager offered me a night in one of their associated hotels; another wild goose chase with unreturned calls and false promises. PLEASE don't give this awful chain your business!

<Content>Completely unsatisfied at the Paramont I booked an executive king room for the night of 10/29/04 through Expedia. With this request it was advertised that I would receive a room with a jetted tub, separate shower, city view/corner room, bath salts, etc. Instead I received an ordinary traditional room with none of the above mentioned amenities. For all this I pre-paid $209.97 (taxes and service fees included) which was the price for the executive king and was never refunded the difference from a standard room. In addition I found the man working at the front desk to be unprofessional. When we arrived he was giggling uncontrollably and did not actually give me a map of the city when he himself offered one. I found the whole experience disappointing. I stayed at this hotel to be close to the Paramont theater. I will never stay here again. If you are looking for the same location and great service and value stay at the Grand Hyatt across the street.

<Content>food was great, rooms comfortable We have stayed here a couple of times and have enjoyed it. The best place to stay if you are going to the Paramount Theatre! The Dragonfish has great food, and they have a LATE happy hour for the food and select drinks that can't be beat!

<Content>Pretty Good, But... For my first visit to Seattle I wanted to explore the downtown a bit and so I booked a couple of nights at the Paramount, based in part on reviews here. I was not particularly disappointed, nor was I blown away. It is on the edge of downtown, with parking lots and demolition going on across the street on one side and the Hyatt on the other. Still, the location isn't bad. My room was nice enough, but faced the Hyatt and so was a little dark with little natural light. The staff were helpful and friendly, and the services fine, although I was disappointed they have no gift shop to buy a magazine or other small items. Dragonfish restaurant attached is not run by the hotel but lets you sign charges to your room, and is a very good place, if a bit pricey. All in all I would probably stay somewhere else next time, but wouldn't discourage anyone from selecting this place either.

<Content>Good location, Good value Great location. Near the action, but not on top of it. Rooms are average size. Beds were comfortable. Sink area is a bit tight, but so it goes. Nice lobby. Coffee in the morning. Easy access to everything. Thought it was a good value.

<Content>great location for the convention center After staying in Seattle at least six times and walking at least ten minutes from my hotel (even those attached to the convention center), this hotel was a blessing in disguise. I know other reviewers refer to it as vintage and older, but you could never tell that from the decor. I found it be be very above average and charming. Only 200 or so rooms, so never crowded. The rooms were larger than most, woth the exception of a small closet. The bed was comfy and had plenty of pillows. I had a corner room and the view was exceptional. My only complaint is that the ice machines are on every other floor.Only two blocks to the front door of the convention center (under the canopy) and right in the heart of everything you need - Pacific Place Mall is two blocks, there are three - count 'em - three Starbucks within two blocks and a Barnes and Noble bookstore. Dragonfish restaurant is attached and has great seafood and sushi. Von's is one block away and the Cheesecake Factory is two blocks, as is The Oceanaire. Go downhill two blocks to get a great view of the space needle. Be warned - you can walk to Pike Place Market from here, but the trip back to the hotel has a vicious hill - wear good shoes or be prepared to take a cab.

<Content>Great for a night at the theater The best thing about the Paramount Hotel is it's location and price compared to other downtown hotels. It's perfect if you have tickets to the nearby Paramount Theater and want to spend the night in Seattle. It's a Coast Hotel and the service standards are higher than most hotels. Designwise, it could be any hotel in any city. The corner rooms are the nicest and have nice city views.

<Content>Good hotel at a good price Stayed here for 4 nights in August 2003. Very helpful and friendly staff. Hotel room was clean and comfortable. Location was excellent. Short walk to Pike Street Market. Monorail is only 2 blocks away to take you to the Space Needle, etc. Nothing fancy, but a good hotel for a good price. Will stay again.

<Content>Stayed Here Repeatedly! I have stayed at the Paramount several times, and plan on staying there with every visit to Seattle. The location is excellent (especially if you like to shop!) and the value is outstanding. The rooms are clean and neat, and the staff is friendly. I especially like the Dragonfish Cafe restaurant - it is one of my favorite restaurants for Asian Fusion.

<Content>Vintage Hotel My companion and I stayed at this hotel because it was one of the most affordable on the day we went. We also like the location of the hotel. It was within walking distance to shopping and entertainment in Capitol Hill. The rooms were pretty large with average furnishings. The furnishings were pretty old. The view was very nice. Nothing fancy about this hotel, but the location and the price were its main attraction. I would stay here again if the price was cheaper than other hotels in the area.
