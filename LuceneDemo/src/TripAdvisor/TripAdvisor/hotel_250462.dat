<Content>COLD! I was there for 2 last days of December. I was quite disappointed with this post-Soviet hotel where heating was not working: after 1 full day(!) they fixed it (a receptionist did it) ... I had an impression that they knew exactly what the problem was but they just wanted to save money on heating!The only good thing is the location (very close to S-Bahn station Adlershof, just between central/east Berlin and Schonefeld airport).

<Content>Value for money Just returned from a three night stay at Berolina airport hotel Berlin. Met German friends who also stayed at this hotel. We all agree that if you are looking for a budget clean bed, hot shower and good continental breakfast in a basic hotel without any frills (or even evening meals being offered!) this hotel is fine. Very much a case of you get what you pay for If you want luxury, high level of comfort and service, pay more and stay somewhere posher!! We found Susies Bistro next door to this hotel served very good evening meals at very good prices with good service. Many people in hotel did the same. We cannot complain with value for money. Hope this helps!

<Content>Simple hotel I stayed here with two of my friends during the Loveparade. It was a complete trip (bus plus hotel) so I don't know how much the hotel itself costs. The rooms were very simple, nothing to comment on it. Not large, but clean. Metrostation is just across the street, about 150 meters as far as I can remember.Breakfast was quite tasteless, even unpleasant, but maybe the hotel didn't bother since it was packed with Loveparade guests. Cheap dried out bread, tasteless cheese and salami, watery orange juice and german tea (tea tastes very sweet, like hot lemonade.) The hotel is quite far away from the centre of Berlin.So, it depends on what you're looking for: a cheap stay and nothing else (I recommend having your breakfast somewhere else), then you should be fine in this hotel.
