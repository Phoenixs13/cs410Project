<Content>You do not sleep well The hotel looks nice, but the most important thing is outright bad: You do not sleep well. Due to inexpensive, synthetic materials of mattress and linen, you spend the night soaking wet, tossing and turning.It's a pity, because everything else is really nice. The location is good, very central, close to Friedrichstra脽e and to the U-Bahn station Stadtmitte. The rooms are beautifully decorated. The bathrooms are good and feature an excellent selection of toiletries, including comb, razor and toothbrush.But when it comes to sleeping, it won't help you. I was soaking wet, woke up every half an hour to turn my blanket. I felt like a figure in Tom Sharpe's novel who had accidentally landed in a bed with latex sheets. And the room was cool and I was perfectly healthy. I am never sweating at night - expect in the NH hotel (and, yes, once in another hotel with a synthetic mattress).

<Content>Functional but dull NH Berlin Mitte is a pretty soul-less business hotel which is functional and central, with moderately comfortable rooms and par-for-the-course service, but which has few other pluses. My one memory of staying at this hotel was the pathetically weak power shower. Fine for business if the Mandala or other hotels are full (as in my case); otherwise, avoid.

<Content>Good Central Location The hotel was booked for business purposes and although this meant spending considerable time in taxis to get to our destination we decided to stop at the NH Berlin Mitte because of its good central location, handy for all the sites and the Christmas markets, for which Berlin is famed at this time of year.The hotel is a standard big-Euro fare hotel, but non the worse for that. The rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable and the reception staff speak embarrasingly good English!The only negative was that they were rennovating the dining room and bar area, so I suppose once completed, visitors will have sparkling new facilities, but it meant we were a bit cramped, particularly at breakfast, which, had I been paying for myself, I wouldn't have bothered with at 18 Euros each.

<Content>Nice breakfast. Clean rooms, nothing special, but very good beds. The hotel is a little business-like. Just like you are walking in an office-building. Rooms are not that big, but comfortable. The breakfast is very nice, but busy. Very nice priced!

<Content>Moderately comfortable stay The NH Berlin Mitte is a big concrete block on a busy road in central Berlin. It is in a convenient location to some places of interest, but a bit of a walk to the main museums and most sights. The hotel rooms look a bit sad and most windows open to gray inner courtyards. There is a small gym with decent sauna and steambath. At present, there is construction in the hotel and as a result only temporary restaurant and business centre facilities are available. Smoking seems obligatory in the public areas of the hotel. Overall, the hotel is comfortable and efficient, but rather bland. I would try and find something nicer next time.

<Content>A great stay in NH Berlin Mitte We returned yesterday from a weekend in Berlin and i was so impressed by this hotel i felt i had to leave feedback. The hotel is ideally located and is very clean and welcoming. The rooms are of a good size, very modern, clean and airy. Our room was located at the back of the hotel and was very quiet. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of going to Berlin and I'll definitely stay there again when i visit Berlin.

<Content>Nice and practical hotel We stayed in this hotel in march and were upgraded as the options we requested were not available. The room was very functional although I would have liked to see the lower class rooms as ours wasnt fantastic. The good thing about NH is that you always know what you are getting, with slight adaptations to the local habits. The great thing about this hotel is it's location: 300 yards from Checkpoint Charlie and in walking distance of the Brandenburg Gate, the museums and Alexander platz and al lot of shops! Very convienent for Schonefeld airport, too!I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A great find A large group of us stayed in this hotel over the New Year Bank Holiday Weekend. The communal areas were swanky and welcoming and without exception the staff were very friendly, booking taxis to the airport and giving helpful tips thoughout our stay etcIt was the little touches that really made my impression of the hotel. We were due to check out on New Year's Day and were allowed to keep our rooms until 3pm without additional charge. In addition the brunch on our last day was extended until 2pm to allow for a lie in after the inevitable big night out before. They even let us put the english footie on in the bar until we went to the airport.The breakfast was plentiful and varied. The rooms were amazingly clean, comfy and well stocked (lots of storage space, hangers, hairdryer, sat TV, free safe, lots of mirrors, freebie toiletries)The location was perfect, we got one tube during the entire trip and walked everywhere else. I would certainly stay again and would recommend to friends and family.

<Content>good quality but no charme This is a 1st class business hotel in the very heart of trendy Berlin-Mitte, just a around the corner to the high-level-shopping-district of Friedrichstrasse and only a few steps to Gendarmenmarkt, Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag. Like other NH-Hotels I know, it offers high quality but lacks individuality. If you appreciate staying in a good hotel that could be in any big city on Earth, then this is your place. If you prefer hotels with a certain personality or special flair, I would recommend other hotels in Berlin, e.g. the Savoy.

<Content>Clean, Comfortable and central I stayed at the NH Berlin Mitte for a weekend break to Berlin with a friend. The hotel was clean and above the usual travel inn, ibis hotels i usually stay in for city breaks... the hotel is only 200m from the underground station and as with lots of european cities it was very easy to navigate our way around. The hotel is very close to checkpoint charlie and a 5-10 minute walk from other major sites. I would say most people staying at the hotel are there on business however we found all the staff to be more than helpful to a couple of 30 somethings visiting the sights and the nightlife. Not sure what the food was like, but the restaurant looked busy - if you have a choice and arent a huge breakfast person - avoid it as within 100m of hotel near underground stop are the usual starbucks, and german cafes for kaffe and kuchen, or coffee and cake... much cheaper and just as tasty as the hotel (i imagine) also just along past the underground is a mini market selling all the nibbles you need - if you want to avoid the expensive mini bar costs. As for the hotel itself, it was spotless, quiet (although on a busy street), air con, rooms tidied daily with the extra toiletry samples missing in the more budget hotel options. I would stay again if visiting Berlin.

<Content>Excellent choice for stay in Berlin We stayed at Nh Berlin-Mitte Hotel for two nights in late August, 2006. The hotel is modern and located in what was formerly East Berlin, so the surrounding area still bears some of the effects of many years of communist control. In the past few years, however, the area has undergone extensive development in certain areas. The hotel is convenient to the Friedrichstrasse shopping district and some other Berlin sites, such as Checkpoint Charlie. The hotel itself is attractive, the rooms are of ample size, clean, modern and comfortable. The restaurant offers good food. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely return if in Berlin.

<Content>A superb stay The NH Berlin Mitte is outstanding. This four star superior hotel has everything you need in a city hotel. My room was very spacious, stylishly, decorated and very quiet. There was a comfortable leather chair to relax in and plenty of cupboard space. Breakfast was rather expensive, but there is a Starbucks and a bakery less than 5 minutes away.

<Content>Solid choice Many good things about the NH Mitte. First- GREAT LOCATION. The hotel is around the corner from the Stadmitte U-Bahn stop, which makes it easy to get around the city. It is also near Checkpoint Charlie, the old Luftwaffe headquarters and the Holocaust Memorial and within walking distance (30-40 minutes) to the Reichstag nad Brandenberug Gate.The rooms are clean, modern and hotel is in a quite part of town, however the bed was a bit thin and lumpy. However after walking all day long, it didn't take much for me to fall asleep. Breakfast is also expensive, and I did not find a nearby restaurant to get breakfast.All in all, a solid choice, allbeit a bit expensive.

<Content>Has A/C but don't make collect calls! My wife and I stayed several nights at this hotel based solely on reviews from this site. We were pleased. The hotel is located near several points of interest and you can just walk there. These include Checkpoint Charlie, Sony Center and the Bradenburg Gate. I don't recommend renting a car here. The trains and buses are excellent and by far the best and cheapest way to get around. Unlike USA, the public transportation system is efficient, clean and mostly crime free. This goes for most of Europe. The hotel had A/C which was nice since we were there during a heat wave. Unfortunately no pool though :-( We were surprised to learn that our room did not come with breakfast included and we would have to pay 12 euro to eat there. We went elsewhere. The location of this hotel is probably its best assest, next to the nice cold A/C of course. Rarely did we have to take a cab anywhere. Most of the time we just walked or took the u-bahn or bus. There is a u-bahn stop litterly around the corner from the hotel. While at the hotel, I made three calls to the USA. I was floored to learn later that each call was over $40 US cash! Do NOT make any calls using the phone in your room.

<Content>Most comfortable hotel room bed ever Stayed at this hotel for two nights when in Berlin for the Love Parade. Fantastic location, very friendly staff, but most notable of all it had the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in in a hotel.....Rooms were a good size, and very clean. Didn't have breakfast, it seemed a bit overpriced at 16 euros, especially considering the number of great cafes in the area.The only negative thing I could say about this hotel was the lack of tea/coffee making factlities in the room....what can I say, I'm British.Other than that,Berlin is a brilliant city. We will certainly return, to both Berlin and this hotel.

<Content>perfect! The hotel is situated right in the city centre. There is an underground station nearby and it's just a couple of minutes' walk to a lot of sights such as Checkpoint Charlie, Potsdamer Platz, Deutscher Dom, Brandenburger Tor etc. Breakfast was great and the rooms are spacious and very clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. If we go to Berlin again we will definitly stay at this hotel again!

<Content>Great location, nice rooms, good quality for money I choose this hotel for a 4 night stay with me wife in Berlin after reading the good reviews here. And it was a good decision.The Hotel is perfectly located close to the Subwaystation Stadtmitte that takes you to several places like the Potsdamer Platz, Friedrichstrasse or Hackesche H枚fe in a matter of minutes. And you can even just walk to the Potsdamer Platz in 10 - 15 min. Great!The rooms are very nice, especially if you have a room facing the courtyard and not the street. The service is good.One downside we were watching is the bar. There was only one lady that had some skills in making drinks the right way, but two others also tried to do that and made some very big mistakes mixing a drink. That's why we can't recommend going to the bar if you want to have a mixed drink. But for a beer, .. its wonderfull and looks great!We'd stay there again!

<Content>Fantastico! I am just back from a 5 days trip in Berlin. This hotel is simply perfect! With an underground station just around the corner (Stadmitte, with 2 lines), it is close to everything. About 400 mtrs from Checkpoint Charlie, 200 mtrs from Gendanmermarkt and Bebelplatz, just around the corner from Friedrichstrasse, you are a nice 20 minutes walk from Unter den Linden and Brandeburg Tor, 500 mtrs from Potsdamer Platz. Rooms are spotless and confortable, the staff is very helpful. I didn't try the breakfast (too expensive for me, 16 euros per person), but the area is full of cafes (try the wonderful blueberry muffins at the Balzac Coff猫e, just around the corner). After a long day of sightseeing, at the 8th floor you find a great fitness and wellness area, with sauna, steam bath, heated stone chairs, towels,water and green apples, all free of charge. Spero di tornare presto a Berlino, nell'NH Berlin Mitte! Have a nice trip, buon viaggio!
