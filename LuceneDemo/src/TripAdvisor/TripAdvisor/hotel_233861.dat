<Content>Christmas Market Getaway Hotel easily accessible from the airport and tram with a tramstop almost outside the hotel.Room were very clean and comfortable but the view from the window was rather disappointing as it was just overgrown wasteland awaiting development.Breakfast was excellent with something to suit everone's taste.The only negative comment I could make would relate to the lack of frendliness and helpfulness shown by the staff. Although check in went very smoothly staff didn't seem to go out of their way to make you feel particularly welcome.

<Content>An Above Average Stay The check-in was efficient, although I must say that the counter personnels could do with a more friendly smile and motivation to serve - especially foreign guests coming out from an almost 24 hour-flight journey.Food selection was good. Drinks were so-so. I loved the German beers on the tap and the loose tea bags that were actually tea leaves. Internet rates were defintely not at a nominal price as we were led to believe. But if one thinks that paying 80 Euros for unlimited access is nominal, then I suppose it is all a matter of personal opinion.Rooms were clean though the room sizes were not something you'd talk about.Generally, if you need a place to stay for business or social networking, then this would be it.

<Content>Not Bad at All We stayed here for the first part of our honeymoon and were pleasantly surprised. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was well equipped and clean. The mini bar was quite impressive too and not too expensive.The first night we were there, we used their restaurant. It was pretty quiet but very plush. The main theme is Spanish food and was one of the most expensive meals we had, but nice all the same.The hotel is a bit out of the way but we managed on the trams, U-bahn and S-bahn quite easily and we felt safe in Berlin (not like Vienna that we went to later!). You can buy day tickets for the hotel for about 6 Euros which we would definitely recommend doing. All in all would definitely recommend but if you want a slightly more central hotel in this chain, there is a NH Freidrichstrasse which is near the main shopping area.

<Content>Nice hotel and pleasant staying I was in Berlin for a Conference which was held in the NH Berlin Alexanderplatz. I also reserved a room in the same hotel for four nights. The hotel is located in the eastern zone of Berlin about 30 mins far from Alexanderplatz by walking . The surrounding zone is quiet and there is a tram station just in front of the hotel connecting it with the Alexanderplatz S-Bahn station. Unfortunately, during my sojourn there was a big public trasport strike so as I could not use any tram, bus or underground. The hotel is good and smart. Rooms are sufficiently large and well furnished. It is pleseant staying in the hotel hall and bar for a drink. Restaurant food is good.A good choice and a convenient quality/price ratio if you find discounted rates through the hotel website.Just two remarks; once arrived, I found a small welcome snack in the room consisiting of a shrimp and a strawberry...They were not really fresh!!Secondly, the very high rates to have an internet connection in the room: ten euros per hour.

<Content>Perfectly Good We have stayed in several NH hotels and have found them to be generally quite good. This one too is perfectly good. Have stayed there twice and each time had a quiet room on the back side. Very clean. Good service. Note that it is a bit further from Alexander Platz than you might at first guess, but taking the tram is easy. Note too that breakfast can be 15 euro in NH hotels.

<Content>Good hotel Stayed here for one night, the location is a little out of the main area of Berlin but it provides good value considering it has been refurbished.The rooms are large and clean breakfast is great!

<Content>Good location, standard hotel Part of the NH Hotel chain it is a quality standard hotel with great staff  service, clean rooms  bathrooms. Nothing particularly interesting / special about the hotel itself. The location is fantastic, central to East Berlin a short walk to Hackescher Markt Tram line stops right near the front of the hotel and buses just around the corner. Short tram ride (5 mins) to central Mitte  Prenzlauer Berg.

<Content>Incredible Reception Staff We went on Easter. We was 4 families with our children. The hotel is good, but undoubtly, the staff at the reception when we arrive on 14th at 4.pm, was incredibly helpful. They gave us all the information, cooperation, and amability that we have never received at any hotel. (And I promise I have travelled a lot in my life). I have problems with my portatil wireless connection, and they connect me. Thank you again. We will come back to this hotel due to their incredible staff.

<Content>New year break This hotel is convenient to the main sites of East Berlin with an excellent tram service to Hakecher Hof and Alexanderplatz. This was a good choice for new year which we enjoyed at the Brandenburg Gate. Tram service operated all night. Rooms were of high standard, breakfasts good and the buffet we had on New Years Eve was good value for money

<Content>Style but little substance If you are after a hotel that has no character but is clean and relatively inexpensive, though by no means cheap, then this is the hotel for you. The location is ok but you have to get the ubahn to get anywhere. The nearest station is about a 5-10 minute walk away. There is not one thing that is individual about this hotel. The rooms are relatively large, the bathroom was good but the room had nothing to distinguish it. The walls are very thin which can be an interesting experience. The bar was ok but small and again had no character. The staff were attentive and friendly enough. Did not have food in the hotel as it was not included in our deal, though it seemed expensive in comparison to a number of good restaurants nearby. It seemed like a hotel favoured by business types. If location is all you are after then go for this hotel, but for character, food and a more memorable experience I intend to stay somewhere different when next visiting Berlin. Probably in Prenzlauberg (or however you spell it!) If you stay in the hotel, or indeed in Berlin visit the famous Italian restuarant (it begins with Quo..)just off from the Alexanderplatz - it is truly fantastic and not that expensive.

<Content>Pretty good We stayed in the NH Berlin Alexanderplatz for three nights over the August Bank holiday weekend and had paid 拢46 per night with Expedia.We arrived late on the Friday night and I am not sure if we were upgraded but we were on the 5th floor and our room was a very good size. It had the usual European bed with two single mattresses, a TV unit, a large desk and chair and a arm chair with foot stool. The bathroom was compact with the shower over the bath but was functional. I had some problems with the temperature of the shower going from very hot to very cold however my partner did not have the same trouble.The hotel was in a reasonable location, we walked into the city both days and it took around 20 minutes to get to Alexanderplatz, you could go on one of two trams in 5 minutes but we preferred the exercise.We did not eat in the hotel as breakfast was not included in our room price so cannot advice on that front however they do have a nice wee bar by the reception.The staff were very courteous and happy to help, their english was excellent.All in all a great hotel for the money however some may wish to pay a bit more to get closer to the city, the NH Hotel in Mitte had a fantastic location for those who do not wish to walk or use public transport.

<Content>A good value, nice hotel This is a great little hotel in a great location of a fantastic city. Its location in the old East Berlin was definitely a plus, with its recent history all around.We stayed here for 4 nights in a party of 8, spread over 5 rooms and there were no compaints from anyone. Two of the rooms were upgraded, but all rooms were of a good size, beds and bathrooms were good. The staff were excellent and always helpful.It is a one minute walk to the Hackescher Markt eateries and train station and a 5 minute walk to the Berlin Dom, which is one of the nicest churches I have seen outside Rome.We did two great tours. One, a walking tour of the Third Reich and the other a bike tour of Potsdam.I would love to return to Berlin, and I would definitely stay at the Alexander Platz Hotel.
