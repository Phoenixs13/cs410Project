<Content>Just What We Were Looking For! We chose this hotel on a recommendation from the bride and groom of the wedding we were in town for. They picked a central location to the rehearsal site, wedding, and the reception. We have never stayed at an Embassy Suites. We loved it!We were immediately greeted by energetic staff. Before we even took our bags upstairs we were told about the Manager's 'Happy Hour.' Free appetizers, wine, liquor and beer every day from 5:30pm - 7:30pm! It was a nice treat to grab a drink before heading to our room or out to dinner.Complimentary, cooked-to-order breakfast every morning too! Omelets, pancakes, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns, pastries, cereal, coffee, tea, etc. They even had a fountain drink machine...I've never had complimentary breakfast that served me my Diet Coke!!!Large open atrium in the center of the hotel with the rooms circling around. I didn't think it was noisy like other reviews stated. Maybe you could request a higher level room. They have a 24 hours store in the lobby that sells snacks and toiletries. There is also a 24 CVS pharmacy practically in the same parking lot, which was very convenient. A few other notes: Courtesy shuttle will take you where you need to go; The Galleria is obviously very close; The lobby has a kiosk that allows you to check-in/check-out at the hotel and check-in for your flight; Rooms were spacious and clean; Room Service is available.Everyone in our group really enjoyed our stay!

<Content>Embassy Suites in Dallas - Typical Stay I only stayed 1 night at the Embassy Suites in Dallas (near the Galleria) for a business trip.Memorable items:* The suite was VERY spacious, large, and clean (two tvs which I didn't watch either). The King size bed was VERY comfortable.* Loved the happy hour with FREE snacks and FREE adult beverages while socializing with my colleagues.* Loved the FREE HOT breakfast the following morning with made to order omlet * The Steak Burger and fries that I ordered from the on-site resturant was AWESOME and affordable when compared to other hotel foodThe only complaints are the following.* High speed internet cost $10 (when most other hotels give this to you for free) * There were very small little ants in running around in my bathroom. This did not prevent me from using it but my wife would have demanded another room * I didn't care for the Swans in the hotel. They should be in a park vs. a hotel.

<Content>Very Comfortable for our Purpose We stayed at this Embassy Suites for business and it was great for us. When we checked in they did not have the double bed room that we reserved but the front desk manager quickly put us in 2 adjoining rooms and comped the extra room. This actually worked out better for us so we were pleased. Del Frisco's is right across the street with fantastic steaks and the front desk also called and checked their hours of operation and made us a reservation. Our rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Breakfast buffet was a little slim but okay. The furniture was a little old and worn out but overall I thought it was worth what we paid to stay there.

<Content>Great location and service but Dirty rooms I am a Hilton Honors member and this Embassy is definitely not up to Hilton standards. The service was very good, we used the hotel shuttle a few times and the front desk manager and shuttle driver were very nice and polite. Once we arrived at the Galleria, we tried to tip the driver and he declined saying he was a manager. I called when we were done and they arrived to pick us up within just a few minutes.The inside of the hotel is nice, swans are beautiful and setting is park-like.Our room was icky. The shower had mildew on the walls and some of it looked like it was even covered up by caulk. Brewed coffee was left in the pot. When we got ready to go to bed, we pulled back the sheets and they had spots and stains. (looked like blood!) We called the front desk and told them our sheets were dirty and they sent someone right up to change them. We have always been happy with Embassy but this location needs some new management in Housekeeping. Ick!

<Content>Before i even got to stay here...... Before i even got to stay at his hotel, i've already experience the worst customer service. I was planning to stay for 7days due to a business trip but i had to cancell because of my trip . I did cancell before the 24hrs. and recieved my cancellation#. A week later the hotel charged my credit card! I called the hotel, spoke to the office manager (G.R.) who was an unpleasant individual and approached me with rudeness and unconcerned treatment. With my cancellation confirmatio#, they still refuse to credit me back the charges due to invalid confirmation. Luckly, i have documents from continetal.com (who'm i made reservations through) about my cancellation number, date, time..etc.etc. My issue is still not resolved, instead my bank is helping me resolve the problem.For personal and business trips, i stay within the Hilton family hotels for my HHonors points. After this poor experience, i will never book a hotel stay at the Embassy Suites-Galleria. VERY POOR CUSTOMER RELATIONS!!!

<Content>Worst Embassy Suites We recently took 45 clients to Dallas and stayed at this hotel because of its location and the standard amenities offered by Embassy Suites. It was a disaster, and wish we had chosen a different hotel. We found the staff extremely difficult to work with in setting up arrangements for meals and the meetings. In our opinion, customer service and satisfaction are not in the staff's vocabulary. I was particularly embarrassed because the staff was rude to our clients, and I had booked the reservations personally.

<Content>My review of the Embassy Reservation was made through my corporate travel website. I arrived late in the evening and it was nice to know my room was guaranteed. Had a room on the 6th floor (sign says floor reserved for Hilon Honors members), dunno if thats entirely true or not since I am a HH member. Walked into the room and there was a letter addressed to my name welcoming me to my room and thanking me for being a guest, etc. Thought that was a neat lil gesture. Overall I was pretty happy with the service from the front desk and housekeeping. The bartender during their evening cocktails and service staff during the breakfast were kind of dry though. I really liked the separate suite and living room arrangement. As others have mentioned, furnishings are kind of bland and certain things are showing their age. The free parking was nice and the location was great within walking distance to Del Frisco's steakhouse, a block or two from The Galleria, and a short drive to beltline.

<Content>Poor public relations I made reservations to this hotel on 7/15/07 for a four night stay starting November 16th, 2007. (confirmation Number 83470977)After finalizing my travel plans and buying airlione tickets I called the hotel directly to change my check in date to November 17th, 2007. This was done in September 2007. I also advised the staff that I would be a late arrival since our flight did not get into Dallas until 11:30 pm and by the time I got my luggage and rental car it would probably be between 12:00am and 1:00am. I was assured that the late arrival would not be a problem and that the non-smoking room with two doubles would be available. On the morning of my flight I again called the hotel to remind the staff of my late arrival. I was again told that my room would be available. My family of five arrived at the hotel at 1:00 am. I was told by the night manager that they only had one room available and that it was a smoking room. Since my 7 year old has allergies and is sensitive to smoke I asked the manager if anything could be done to get a different room. He said that the smoking room was the only one available. Because it was already late I decided to check the room to see if it was at least clean enough to stay for the night until another room would be availabe the following day. When I was shown the room, it reeked of cigarette smoke. The room was dark and dingy and felt like a cave. The furnishings were old and soiled. I told the manager that the room was not acceptable. He said that he was sorry but that was the best that he could do. I asked if I could use the hotel phone to look for another hotel. He told me that I had to use the pay phone. When I went to the pay phone, there was no phone book. I asked the manger for a phone book and he said that he did not have one. I remembered passing a Hyatt Place one block away. I called the hotel and they had a room available for less than what I was paying at the Embassy Suites. This is where we ended up staying for the trip. It was a newly remodeled hotel with oversized rooms and a 42 inch flat panel TV. I was dissapointed with the Embassy Suies managment for not even attempting to find me a room with another Hilton family hotel for my stay and did not seem to care that they had over booked their rooms. I returned the next two days to talk Carol Chandler, the general manager but each time I was told that she was not in. I also left my cell phone number for her to call and she never did. If you are looking for a hotel near the Galleria in Dallas Texas I highly recommend the Hyatt Place which is a two minute walk to the Galleria, and not the Embassy Suites on Noel Road.

<Content>Great location, but... This Embassy Suites location is in dire need of a renovation. The room I had was clean, but very worn. The TV's are at least 15 years old and there is no in room mini-bar.One of my biggest problems was that this is the first 'business' oriented hotel that I have stayed at with such a restrictive firewall policy that I could not use my VPN or my Webmail. Now this might seem like a nit to some, but for someone whose business lives and dies by email, this is no little thing.Other info: --the king bed was on the soft side--there were plenty of pillows but not enough blankets (it was in the thirties when I stayed)--it is very quiet--the indoor pool looked nice (I didn't use it)

<Content>No frills, clean and comfortable My wife and I stayed at the Embassy during Thanksgiving weekend. Our stay was everything you come to expect for an Embassy Suites. Clean, comfortable and affordable.The room was clean and everything worked Ok. The complimentary breakfast is a nice addition to the room rate. Alos, the complimentary parking may save you a few bucks compared to other hotels in the area. The hotel is within walking distance to the Galleria Mall and other restaurants and shops. The only negative comment is that rooms are starting to show their age. The management shall begin a renovation program before the wear and tear becomes unbearable.

<Content>Nice rooms, but noisy and kids running everywhere My husband and I stayed here for our 1st anniversary. We thought it would be a nice place at a great price. Well, the room was nice.. but later that night when we wanted to go to sleep, there were kids running up and down in the halls and also teenagers standing around having screaming matches with each other. I don't know where their parents were, but the way this hotel is laid out, you can hear it ALL. Also the breakfast was just average, but at least it was free. I don't know if I would stay here again.

<Content>Location, Swans, with Kids - A+ Standard easy Embassy Suites stay, but this one had perqs that put it over the top. For the price especially, I'd love to stay here in any city. First, everything looked recently updated. Clean lobby, clean rooms, clean dining area.Second, the swans in the lobby were so graceful and fun to watch. They were totally well behaved.Breakfast buffet was better than most, with hot eggs cooked to order. Fabulous omlettes. Good fresh fruit. Also, a happy hour we never attended, but it looked well attended.Pool overlooked by gym area, so we could work out and swim and all look at each other. Both were uncrowded.

<Content>TOP NOTCH!! My hubby and I stayed @ the Embassy Suites this past weekend to celebrate our anniversary. And boy...were we surprised at the absolute, genuine hospitality of the whole staff. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! SO VERY CLEAN! The rooms were just the right size for us. Everyone there was so helpful. It is located so very close to restaraunts, shopping, etc. Lina (the front desk agent) is the BEST!!! We will surely stay here again. The comp breakfast was great! It was all great! NO KIDDING! Eugene (the shuttle driver) was just wonderful. My hubby and I enjoyed his conversation. Just all around great people and hotel!

<Content>nice stay- good location Stayed here for 2 nights in April 2007 for business. The hotel is a typical embassy suites layout-courtyard inside, rooms outside. The happy hour and free breakfast were pretty good as usual. The rooms were nice although the desk could have been a little bigger and the lighting a little stronger. But overall, nice location- I walked to the Galleria mall from the Embassy Suites and nice perks.

<Content>Nice, clean and comfortable. I stayed at the Embassy Suites in January for a church retreat. This hotel surprised me to be a three star when in some aspects it was better than some 4 stars that I have stayed in. The Happy Hour bar had decent wine. The swans were great for my toddler. She enjoyed watching them. The morning breakfast buffet was pretty good - on par with an IHOP as in quality. No sodas were availble though just some juices and milk. The conference room was a decent size and the staff seemed happy to try to help. It's close to the Galleria for some shopping and some nice restaurants. The room was nicely sized. There were four of us and we were quite comfortable.I definitely will return to an Embassy Suites espeically when I consider needing to stay in a hotel with my toddler.

<Content>Home away from Home I can't tell you how much I love this hotel! Large suites, Clean and comfortable, great location, and the SWANS in the lobby are just magnificent! I have stayed there now 3 times and continue to love it even more. The free breakfast is the absolute best. The beds are nice. I just love it. I hesitate to write this review because I don't want the hotel to be booked up when I need to stay here!Selfish, but the thought did occur to me.

<Content>Nice hotel pay attention to bill The hotel was real nice they send up your check out letter for $131.10 to your room and when they charged it to my card was $150.77 and I didn't use room service or drink the rooms water. I didn't use anything that wasn't suppose to come with the room. The place is lovely but watch your bill.

<Content>Great Stay Stayed at the Embassy Suites near the Galleria November 12 - 14, 2004. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, we had no problems what so ever. The food in the restaurant was great, including the cooked-to-order breakfast. Complimentary transportation to Galleria and Valley View malls was priceless! Keep up the good work.
