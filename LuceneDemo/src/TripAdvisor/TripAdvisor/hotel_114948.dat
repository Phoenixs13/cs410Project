<Content>Great Hotel, Great Service I recently stayed at the Stoneleigh on a quick business trip and it was a great hotel...they did a great job with the renovation. The room was large, nicely decorated and appointed with a large walk-in closet, flat screen TV, and nicely stocked mini-fridge/bar (extra cost of course). The bathroom was also very nice with granite tops and a large tub that would be great for soaking if that's your thing. When I arrived (really late) and walked into my room, the bed was turned down with a robe laid on the bed, flat screen TV turned on and the bathroom light on ready for my use. This was also done for me on the next night when I returned from dinner.The Staff was also very accomodating and helpful. One of the Concierges, Anthony, was great, giving me recommendations on good restaurants in the area. Also, since I had not rented a car and was taking cabs, he personally offered to drive me to the restaurant and pick me up in the house car, a late model Mercedes. I wanted to check out the spa but I could not get a same-day appointment in the evening (as I was working during the day), so I would recommend booking services early. However, the fitness center was nice and appropriate for a hotel of the Stoneleigh's size. To wrap up, it was a great stay, I would definitely recommend it to friends, family, and colleagues!

<Content>Fantastic Spa!!! Great hotel! I booked the premier king room for $132/night on expedia but read reviews on tripadvisor.com. Noticed that I should join Preferred hotels to get an upgrade if it was available and I did. We got a double upgrade to a studio that is normally $400/night because it was available! Awesome room for the price we paid! The price of the food at the hotel is high, but there aren't any good restaurants real close by. We stayed at the hotel most of the time. Bring a coffeemaker, so you don't have to spend $14 for a pot of coffee! I make hot coffee and tea and iced tea. Cokes at this place were $4! So we just drank coffee and tea that I made. Spent 2 days at the spa. Awesome! This is THE hotel to choose, hands down!We had tix to see Tina Turner, and the American Airline Center was only 1 mile away. We went to the JFK Museum which was good--about a 2 hour trip to venture through but had to wait about 1 hour to get in there in the first place.

<Content>Great Surprise I travel to Dallas often to see my son who attends SMU and usually stay elsewhere but my regular hotel was booked and they actually told me about The Stoneleigh. It was a pleasant surprise. Great hotel, great service, very clean and upscale decor. Rooms were very comfortable, loved the spa too. I would highly recommend this one to my friends!

<Content>The Top TA Rated Hotel in Dallas?? Booked this hotel based upon prior TA user reviews which ranked this hotel as the top hotel in Dallas. I am rarely disappointed by recommendations from TA users, but am in this case. Just returned from a weekend stay with my wife and on one hand the decor and ambience of the hotel is very good. However, there were a number of service gaffes that I would not expect from a top ranked hotel. On the positive side, the lobby and bar area are well done. We had a smaller room with a king bed and the decor was very attractive and new. So physically, the interior of the hotel is beautiful. However, I had higher expectations of service where the hotel really dropped the ball. Arrived Friday afternoon and room was not ready. OK, and they did call later in the afternoon to let me know when my room was ready. Asked to have our bags which were left with the bellman delivered to the room. Returned to the hotel later to get the room key and found my bags were not in the room. Called the front desk to tell them and was told the bellman would deliver them. They did not arrive. Called again and was told the bellman was unavailable and they would have someone else deliver our bags. Got another call to the room as they then could not find our bags. By this time we were going to be late for our event that evening. Finally the front desk employee brought the bags himself to the room. Went back down to get our car from the valet and we were running late. All parking is done by the valet for a $20 daily fee. There were three valet parkers and one went to get our car and then came back and asked what our name was as he could not locate our car. Another 15 minutes and we are even later for our evening plans. We did not try the spa this trip, but I got such a poor first impression on service and stayed in other midtown hotel properties where I did not experience these service problems that I more than likely will not stay at this hotel again. There is condo construction right next door associated with the Stoneleigh and although we were on the 7th floor, there was sufficient noise even during the evening from surrounding establishments heard from our room. Last comment, while the room was nice. I did not enjoy the placement of the AC vents which oddly enough were across the room from the king size bed but blew directly in our faces while in bed and the vents were not adjustable. Not a huge disappointment, but not deserving of the top ranking of Dallas hotels in my opinion.

<Content>Top Notch Very nice and comfortable. i would give it excellent but the parking was under construction. the valet was nice but not much room to drive.that was the only inconvenience. great rate for specials. large plasma tv and the rooms were big and comfortable. breakfast was pricy but good. nice lounge. friendly and helpful staff. we did not have time to use the spa though. location was good, north of downtown. if you can make it through the dallas construction then it is well worth the stay. a great romantic weekend getaway for a couple. i did not see any children. did not walk anywhere. north of the hotel is kinda seedy but south looks nice. will definitely stay again.

<Content>Great pedicure! I stayed here for two nights and loved it! The decor was great. Very roomy bathroom. The service was good. The best part was my pedicure. The spa downstairs is just wonderful. Very soothing. The food was delicous, although some of the portions were a bit small.

<Content>My new favorite Hotel in Dallas! People please give this place a chance you will not be disappointed! What makes this place so great? Is it the totally new interior? The awesome restaurant? The cool bar? NO. Although all or these things where perfect, it was the service that blew me away! I have stayed at many 5 star hotels, in the US  in Mexico, is right up there in my top 3! That says A LOT! Special thanks goes to Anthony, Sucba,  Cliff. I cant wait to go back! Great job Stoneleigh! See you soon!

<Content>The Stoneleigh is Back! Before it closed for a full remodel, the once-proud Stoneleigh had sunk about as low as you can get. We're talking big rodents, bad rooms and scary people in the lobby, folks. So it was a bit angst-inducing for me to book a night at the new version of this hotel. But I'm glad I did. The rooms are excellent; basically double the size of the past version and nicely furnished. Excellent facvilities, nice bar and very good restaurant as well. I'd like to give special mention to the consigere, Kat, who let me use the shower downsdtairs after I had gone running even though I had checked out earlier in the day. I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat!

<Content>great hotel, not as convenient as staying downtown I'm spending 4 weeks working in downtown Dallas and staying at 4 different hotels. The Stoneleigh is definitely the nicest - the rooms are a step up from the Adolphus, but it was somewhat inconvenient for getting downtown. Its a quick drive, but considering the overnight parking at the Stoneleigh is $21.65 and then daily parking downtown is $15-20, it makes more sense to leave the car at the hotel. That means either cabbing it, taking the bus, or the trolley. The walk involved with the trolley was too far in business clothes and the trolley is not air conditioned (not good in the summer.) You can catch the bus right outside the Stoneleigh and it dropped me off a block from the building, but its a jolting, bumpy ride and you have to have exact change, in cash.IMO, there's a big difference between this hotel and the Adolphus - everything about the Stoneleigh was updated, pristinely clean, and top notch. They did turn down service with chocolates, had these great robes, and flat screen TVs. They actually provided starch with the iron. I really enjoyed the comfortable seating on the front deck. Its also a quick walk down to the Katy Trail and the park on Turtle Creek.Most of the restaurants within walking distance are pretty expensive. We had pizza and salad at Coal Vines for $25/each. It was good, but ouch! Mattitos was good and more reasonable.One issue I had was the design of my room put the bed right next to the door and the room was very close to the elevators, which made for a noise problem. I was also woken up at 4am by a hotel employee using a 2 way radio right outside my door. Check Expedia for prices - it was $130/night for the week I was there.

<Content>Great hotel - Renovated I just finished a 3 night stay at the Stoneleigh Hotel  Spa in Dallas. I booked the hotel from their website and booked a Studio Suite. I had to come into town for a meeting and also to do some shopping before heading to New York.I was flying from Buenos Aires and the flight got in very early at 7 AM. I emailed ahead of time and asked if I could check-in early and one of the managers, Anita, confirmed it would be fine. The hotel is in a great area conveniently located in the Uptown Area. It鈥檚 very close to downtown and also you have quick access to the Tollway and also Highway 75. It鈥檚 also close to Highland Park where my friend lives so it was convenient.The hotel has recently been renovated and the hotel got a nice write up in the Wall Street Journal last week. They just finished a $36 million renovation. The lobby isn鈥檛 anything over the top but nice. I never stayed at the hotel before the renovation so I can鈥檛 compare it to before but it鈥檚 nice.My room was very big with 4 large windows, a king size bed, a big 46鈥?high definition TV, nice bathroom and a walk in closet with plenty of room. The bed was very comfortable as well.  My air conditioning wasn鈥檛 working right the first day and I complained and they sent up a maintenance worker right away and he confirmed it was just blowing air and fixed it. The staff was always very friendly. My only complaint/problem was the first day I called down to ask for some razors to shave (I forgot to pack them). The front desk confirmed they would send someone up with some. They never did even after 3 calls down to the desk. They kept saying, 鈥渟omeone is on their way up鈥?but they never came. I would have just preferred them saying they didn鈥檛 have any if they didn鈥檛. Also, the biggest problem is the valet parking area. It鈥檚 extremely small and not well organized. Most people coming in town will probably have a rental car as taxis aren鈥檛 too common in Dallas compared to other large cities. They charge u$s 21 per day for parking which is common in hotels in this area. The problem is that people come to the hotel for dinner to eat or to have drinks in the bar so that parking area is a total zoo. The guys seem to try but they had some problems. I called down to have my car ready and sometimes they didn鈥檛 have it ready and one night I had to wait almost 20 minutes for my car. 1 time they couldn鈥檛 find my keys. Also, the night that it was really hectic was a Friday and I went out and drove to nearby Highland Park to pick up a friend for dinner and I noticed the valet guys left someone else鈥檚 car keys in my front seat! Fortunately I was going to dinner at Craft which was close by so I stopped by the hotel to drop off the keys. I can鈥檛 imagine if I didn鈥檛 notice them and bring them back what the hotel would have done for this guest/customer if they wanted to leave. I found this a bit troubling.Really the only complaint I had was the valet parking situation but the hotel was great. One thing to note is they are building a building next door to the hotel so there is a bit of noise in the morning and throughout the day. If you want to sleep in and are a light sleeper, keep this in mind.All in all a great hotel with friendly staff and comfortable rooms.

<Content>Great staff - wonderful room. I just returned from a business trip to Dallas. I stayed in room 602 which was a studio suite -- as a member of the I Prefer club I was upgraded to a larger room for a rate of 216 a night. The room was terrific. There is a nice sitting area with couch and chair. The bedroom and living room are separated by a large dresser with drawers on both sides. The Flat screen TV swivels so you can have it face the bed or the living room. The bathroom was by far the best part of the room. Rich colors, and a really nice large standing shower. A very luxurious feel. My only complaint was the bed - the mattress was OK. Linens are great - just the mattress. Perhaps they didn't replace them in the remodel?The lobby is breathtaking. Very bold colors and fun chandeliers.All in all I would stay here again - the price was a true bargain too. Check out the I Prefer program, its free to join.

<Content>WOW - Stunning Hotel - Great Rates! We were in Dallas to see the Stars play, and wanted something within a reasonable distance from American Airlines Center. The W and the Ritz (along with a number of other Boutique hotels) were close by and charging $350-450 for the night. The Stoneleigh was at $210 - so we opted it for it because it was newly renovated. What a beautiful hotel. They aren't exaggerating when they say a 40 million makeover.We had to wait for our room, and decided to have a cocktail. When paying our tab, the manager came over to tell us that the hotel was picking it up due to the wait. NICE! The rooms are HUGE. The room has a king bed on one side, a sofa area on the other - it's divided by a credenza with a flat screen tv that turns between the room. There is a huge walk in closet and a nice big bathroom.When leaving for the hockey game we went to get a cab - instead the house car (nice NEW Mercedes) pulled up and offered us a complimentary ride to the center. No charge - but we did tip $10 for the ride.The only negative is the amount of construction in that area - I'm never bothered by noise - I always have my earplugs with me. Just a heads up to anyone who books anywhere in downtown Dallas. Oh - and the rooms don't have coffee makers - just pop down to the bar where they have a complimentary coffee bar set up.Lastly, I checked prices on all the internet companies, and then booked directly with the hotel - who matched their price (their on-line rate was a bit higher). They were very accomodating!

<Content>Nice Location Stayed here last week. Nice hotel. Health Club is pretty small. Restaurant is beautiful. The dinner menu is really rich but had a great selection. Breakfast was delicous. My server must have been in theater because he was very dramatic for 7am in the morning.Negative-My bathroom had lots of little black hairs which grossed me out.

<Content>Lovely Valentine's After reading the other reviews on the website, my girlfriend and I were a little hesitant to spend Valentine's Day at the hotel, but because we had heard that it had just undergone a massive renovation, we decided to take a chance. We were not disappointed in the least. We could really tell that a lot of money and time had gone into revamping the hotel, and the details were impeccible. As people who are accustomed to first class service, all of our expectations were met. We will definitely return on our next trip to Dallas.

<Content>wow! The new Stoneleigh Hotel  Spa is utterly stunning! (I had stayed at the hotel prior for a family reunion in 2004 and was met with a historic hotel in desperate need of renovation). The new Stoneleigh is a different story--- my girlfriends and I enjoyed awesome spa treatments (Luxe Parafin Mani/Pedi) and cocktails on their huge patio overlooking Uptown Dallas. The rooms are gorgeous and HUGE!
