<Content>nice, comfortable, clean and good location Very nice hotel, next to the new main train station in Berlin. Close to U-Bahn. There is wathed Parking lot for 3 EUR a day!The Hotel is very clean and you can have good breakfest for additional 5,00 EUR. The room I had (409) is quite large with nice loggia on street side. The bathroom was big enaough and clean. There was flat TV but no refrigerator and no AC. The beds are comfortable.The price/quality ratio is very good!I can advise this hotel.There was no free internet access.
