<Content>Decent, affordable stay for family In a grouping of average hotels, we found this Inn to have the only room to affordably and most comfortably accommodate our family of 5 (3 girls + parents) in one room for 3 nights (2 Q + sofabed). Water pressure was excellent; we had to request more towels but that was no problem. Beds were feather toppers on old mattress, so that's a personal opinion - mixed reviews among our family, but we did all sleep. The breakfast was better than expected, with a good variety of choices (same choices each day, but many options). The pool and hot tub area were nice and never really busy. All the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. The area across the highway loop is not such a great area, but food, fuel  shopping is pretty easily accessible past that small spot or even back the other way from the loop. In general, this hotel could use a little TLC, but it seems like wear-and-tear cosmetic stuff. We'd probably stay there again.

<Content>Perfectly fine for the price The rate here was almost half what I was seeing at most other properties in Dallas, so my expectations weren't too high. Even after arriving, I wasn't completely sure about it, just because the area is kind of blah. Not bad, really. Just blah.But check-in was easy as could be and they put me in a queen bed suite. The good thing about that was there was a sitting room of sorts that separated the bedroom from the hallway. If noise was an issue, I didn't notice it. Room also had a fridge, two televisions (one in the bedroom, one in the sitting room).The AC was kind of loud, but I personally like to have a slight bit of room noise. Everything in the room worked fine.Only two minor complaints- the fitness center is in big need of a remodel. They just need to replace everything in there. And the breakfast buffet could use some work.But for $80, there's not much else to quibble about. It was better than I expected.

<Content>Great place to stay near Love Field I admit that I didn't spend a whole lot of time at the hotel, but the time I did spend there was above expectations.I flew in to Love Field since I had to do some work up in McKinney. i wanted a place that was close to the airport for my only night in town, so I didn't have to mess with traffic in the morning on the way to the airport. This hotel is extremely clean, friendly, and the room I stayed in was great. 2 separate rooms, one with a king bed and TV, the other has a sleeper sofa and TV. Great setup, I'm not sure what room type it was, so I don't know if they're all like that. It was only me, so it was a waste of space, but I appreciated not feeling crammed. Also, bathroom was nice and spacious. I can't rate the room service since I only stayed one night, but when I got there it was very clean.I saw a lot of other hotel complaints about airplane noise and planes flying directly overhead. I didn't notice this at all at this hotel, even though it was close to the airport....I had a very quiet night's rest.Anyway, typical La Quinta continental breakfast: Waffle maker, fruits, breads, cereal, juices. That was just fine for me.If you don't have to fly to DFW, and want a place close to the airport to avoid the hassles, stay here...I don't think you'll regret it at all.It didn't seem like there was much to do around there though, so at least get yourself some transportation.

<Content>Great Place To Stay With Great Prices Me  my husband stayed here for one night as kind of a getaway from the kids because it was our 5 year anniversary.... we didn't have much money otherwise we would have stayed WAY longer! We picked this hotel because it has an indoor swimming pool and hot tub - that was our main reason for picking it and the fact that we usually stay in La Quintas. It was everything we expected and more. For $100 a night we got the indoor pool and hot tub which was really nice - we got a VERY spacious room with TWO tvs which would be great for people traveling with children. It was very clean, had a fridge, microwave, a fold out couch bed, a desk, a kitchen sink, and it had two sets of french doors seperating the two rooms... the room with the king size bed, and the room with the couch. It had everything we wanted, the people were friendly, we had no problem with getting the room we had asked for... king/smoking... and the free breakfast was pretty good. They had eggs and sausage... the sausage was really good and so was teh orange juice. It's a kind of small hotel so we there weren't many people, and therefore we had the pool and hot tub to ourselves! And the pool and hot tub hours are 6AM to 12 midnight which was REALLY nice!! They also had an exercise room. We were very suprised by the size of our room. And of course like most La Quintas they had the regular movies you could rent and adult movies also on the TV. It was better than expected. Oh, and the king bed had a down mattress pad on it... which helped with the comfort. Not sure what kind of feathers were in it, but it was nice. The air conditioner (which we didn't use because it was November) but the air conditioner had a piece of curved plastic on it that I'm guessing is suppose to help manuever the air flow towards you instead of up into the air which I thought was pretty cool. And the shower/bath tub had a curved shower curtain which I love! Anyway, it was a wonderful place to stay for the price - we were VERY pleased, and we had a very nice, pleasent stay. Great place, would highly recommend!! Would have added some photos, but I didn't take any! Sorry!

<Content>Nice Hotel a little confusing location I was here just about 2 weeks ago for business. We stay at LaQuinta's all the time. I was in room 101. It had a couch, refrigerator, desk, and a separate room where the bed was. It had the usual hair dryer, iron  ironing board. I felt like the maid didn't do that great of a job so I only let her clean once. I always bring my own lysol or clorox wet wipes and wipe every thing down so I didn't see the need for her to come back. The pillows and the bed were very nice. It also had a ceiling fan in the living room. The staff was friendly enough. I say confusing location only because you can only take a right out of the hotel unless you go to the hotel next door and drive along a fence, etc... to make a right. The hotel is close to the highway. There was plenty to eat around there. I was alone and felt safe by myself. I would stay here again in a minute.

<Content>Spacious Rooms We stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to Love Field and offer of a complimentary airport shuttle. The rooms were clean, attractively decorated, spacious and stocked with all the amenities that you would need. Although located near several major highways and the airport, it was quite and peaceful. Breakfast was included. This hotel is an excellent value for the price.
