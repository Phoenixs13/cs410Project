<Content>Consider the H10 Hotel Before This One I am writing this review having just checked in AND out in a matter of 2 hours. I made a reservation based on reviews on this website and was underwhelmed, especially after shopping around other budget hotels on the Rambla. We reserved based on 60E a night for a double and the hotel description included a common area for people to share. I couldn麓t remember if they said they had wifi but I figured we could try to find a signal around. Well, the common area was now 篓private and there was not an electrical outlet in sight to even keep a laptop plugged in to find a signal. The common area and rooms are dated with fluorescent lighting but the place IS very clean. Clean, but in a communist era building feeling kind of way. You need to return the key to the receptionist which is common in this area but the people are usually not at the desk so you have to knock on the kitchen door which is a bit of a bother. My husband was worried about the security of the single doornob lock (the kind you have in a bathroom) and we we needed wifi access/an electrical plug (!) so we started looking for another hotel. We ended up walking down La Ramblas to Hotel Lloret and their doubles were 68E a night, slightly better amenities and updates with a pleasant common area and free wifi. The Camper Hotel started at 245E a night which was too much. We ended up at H10 Hotel a block south of Hotel Ginebra and was blown away at what we were getting for the same 60E a night. H10 is modernly updated, with keycard access, free terminals and wifi, new/nice restaurant/bar area with free refreshments, and at least three outlet plugs and a small desk area for a laptop. The H10 and Ginebra are worlds apart for the same 60E a total no brainer. Ginebra should only be charging 40E at most for the quality of rooms offered. I highly recommend staying elsewhere, esp. after having compared these places myself. BTW we were charged 40% of our 3 night stay which was supposed to be 180E, so we gladly paid 72E to get out of there. Know this before reserving.

<Content>Very Average We stayed for 5 nights in October this year. The room was really tiny and reasonably clean, but very tired decor. Great location, but at 87 Euro without breakfast, it was the most expensive room in our 3 week long trip through Spain, and I have to say, my least favourite.Nice and quiet from the street noise.The Cortes Inglese (not sure of the spelling!) department store on the other side of the square has great food for a picnic lunch, and bottles of water for 37 Euro cents

<Content>Perfect for a short getaway! We chose this hotel thanks to the previous reviews we read here.Infact when we arrived there all was exactly as said: central location, easy access from/to the Airport, etc.It鈥檚 also very safe because it鈥檚 on the third floor of a building so people must go thru a doormen at the entrance, and then thru the hotel receptionist who鈥檚 always there 24h day.Also friendly staff (they don鈥檛 speak English though); we had a late night departure flight, and they kept custody of our bags all day long.So I just want to add a couple of tips:Noise 鈥?yes鈥?but from the inside! Outside traffic noise is well stopped by the windows, while inside walls and doors are very thin, so people arriving and talking late at night can be disturbing. Anyway there are only few rooms, so there isn鈥檛 much back  forth.But if you want to avoid an irritating night awakening, ear plugs are definitely suggested.Beds 鈥?definitely not the best bed I have ever slept in鈥? if you are a couple you may want to chose separate beds, because they are REALLY small and two persons can barely spin!Eventually considering the room rates, it鈥檚 the best solution you can find in Barcelona, and if yours is a short getaway that is the best solution.Plus it鈥檚 definitely very clean, and that was the most important thing for us.

<Content>Great Value, Great Location I was a little nervous about staying here since it is a budget hotel but it was GREAT deal and I would encourage anyone looking for a good location at a reasonable cost to check it out. You are located right off the Plaza de Catalunya only a few minutes walk to Las ramblas and the Gaudi houses.You enter a beautiful lobby and take a tiny elevator up to the 3rd floor. The hotel is more like a hostel in that it has bedrooms, a shared living area and kitchen that you can use. The nice thing is that it has a 24 hour reception desk and private bathrooms for many of the rooms. Our room was a good size and so was the bathroom. It was very clean and was safe and secure. Our room even had a view of the plaza and was not too noisy. They have metal gates that you can rolll down for even more noise protection but since we are fron Manhattan- this was quiet to us. Though they have soap in the bathroom, you do need to bring all your other toiletries. The water pressure is a bit weak but not too bad.The only negative is that you must be buzzed in at night. On one night, our receptionist seemed to have fallen asleep and we had to buzz in for at least 10 minutes. Though the staff apologized over and over, you may want to take the phone number just in case.

<Content>Too small and noisy I stayed at this hotel for one night. Room is extremely small (I mean really small - I hardly remember staying in a smaller room, and I'm used to european and not US standards). No conditioning, which is important in Spain even in Sep. Room was blocked with scaffolding. Because it was really hot, I was almost swimming in my bedsheet. Advantages: cheap, right in the center. So, in cool season it might be option to consider. Next time I just rented an appartment, I think it's a much better option in Barcelona if you stay for more than 3-4 days. Toilet bowl contains smth like shredder, which produces loud noise and you can here it from other rooms as well. Noisy. Smell isn't good. A girl which showed room to me, asked me to wait, ran before me and deodorazied it. I didn't help. Furniture seems old, and in bad condition.

<Content>Only for Littlies Great location, but not for the larger family. Our room was tiny, and the en-suite was for shorter persons only. If you share a room, it better be with a very close friend! Unfortunately due to exterior refurbishment, the whole building was covered in a tarpaulin, so we got all the noise, none of the view. But the staff were very helpful and friendly, and the beds were clean. What more could you expect for the price!

<Content>I stay here every year! I have stayed here every year for the past ten years or so. Before that the family who own it ran another hotel and I stayed with them too. It is centrally located and very reasonably priced. Although the walls of the rooms are thin, this is a minor problem compared to the convenience of having train, bus and subway within a few steps of the hotel. The view from some of the rooms is wonderful; watching one policeman control the traffic in Pla莽a de Catalunya during rush hour is a sight not to be missed. The family are as helpful as any I have encountered in my fifty five years of travelling around the globe. I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.

<Content>Great location and price! Nice people too I stayed at the Hotel Ginebra for seven nights in Sept. 2004 and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I found it fairly quiet as I had a single room that faced inward and did not share a wall with another room. The room was clean and housekeeping kept it that way.The hotel has a prime location and the price met my budget. As a first time visitor to Barcelona and Europe I found the staff to be friendly and enjoyed the intamacy of only 12 rooms. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Inexpensive hotel with excellent location My sister and I stayed in Hotel Ginebra for five nights during a vacation in June 2004. The location was excellent, just off Placa Catalunya. The room was clean and the towels were changed every day. Another review on the site said the room was small and the hotel noisy. Our room was big enough - we were out all day shopping or sightseeing and just needed a place to shower and sleep. For this there was plenty of space. When the people in the room next door spoke we did hear them quite well, but we were not at all bothered by noise. We paid 75 Euros per night. Considering the location and the prices of other hotels with available rooms, this was inexpensive. All in all we were very happy with our choice of accomodation!

<Content>tiny and loud, but great location I booked a room here after reading a review in the Time Out guide book and stayed for 3 nights in 3/04. It's a great location; the family that owns it is super nice, but the rooms are tiny and noisy. I could hear entire conversations from the people staying in the adjacent room. I can't say that I'd stay here again, but if the noise and lack of space don't bother you, it's a great location and not too expensive.
