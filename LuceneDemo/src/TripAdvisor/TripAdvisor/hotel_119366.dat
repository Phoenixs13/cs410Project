<Content>Drug infested My own experience! My toliet over flowed at 11:00 pm, front desk stated she did not cause the problem had me fix it. I had to check out the plunnger with my ID. NO Maintance for the problem!!!! I had drug dealers in front of every room I turned. Kids screaming outside my room during the weekend days and early morning. When I nedded security to walk me to my room after I needed a plunger he just sat in the main office hanging out drinking coffee. If you have any class don't consider unless you are in dire straights!

<Content>Not my cup of tea!! This place actually could be very nice. It's got a great room layout, the pool is very nice and the location is wonderful. During the daytime there would be kids running around the place without parents and people fixing their cars in the parking lots. In the night time is when it became very obvious it was not a good location to be. I stayed in this place for a week and 3 of the 7 nights there were police helicopters shining their lights into the complex. I dont know if anything was actually going on, I'm just reporting that it made me feel a bit uneasy that the police seemed to feel the need to monitor this property in this sort of manner.

<Content>You get what you pay for! From the outside this hotel looks nice. Everything is well kept. But once you get inside the room it's another story. The room we stayed in had stains on the floor and couch and the walls and doors were all patched up. It was quite loud at night which made it hard to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you want a cheap place to stay. The staff was really nice though and helped with any question we had.

<Content>Good, affordable and clean Have stayed at both the Indian School Road and Yorkshire Drive Suites and both give excellent value for money.The Yorkshire Drive premises is within walking distance of a a large strip mall with shops, eateries and cinemas. The bus also stops right outside the gate and it's not a very long trip to other malls.The Indian School premises is similar in design and layout. When you come out of the gate turn right and head for Central where you can catch a 15 min max ride into downtown. Caution in that Indian School to the right looks a little questionable, especilly at night, but the ocmplex is certainly safe.I have recorded my experiences in phoenix and arizona at ---------------If anyone would like any advice drop me a line, mark@totalphoenix.com
