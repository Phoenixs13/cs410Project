<Content>Great More than a hotel, is a very large house. From the moment we arrived and were received by the general manager, Mr. Ramirez, as I felt in my own home. The attentions were excessive. In no other place had felt the warmth of people in the service and treatment. They explained at the outset most interesting places of the country and its history. It was really wonderful. The hotel is an old mansion County with Spanish influences converted into a bed and breakfast inn. The rooms are very clean. The bathroom is comfortable, air, TV and phone. I recommend especially for people interested in independent and learn about other cultures and customsJesus M and FamilyTampa, FL.

<Content>Don't believe Lonely Planet guidebook!!!!! We made an unexpected stay in San Juan with short notice. As we were traveling I had no real access to a computer so trusted in my guidebook Puerto Rico which is published by Lonely Planet and which I just bought at the airport bookstore. They gave this hotel a very good review. I have never felt more betrayed by the guidebook in my life! It was awful, one of the worst places we have ever stayed in worldwide in 40+ years of traveling. The place looked like maybe 10-15 years ago it MIGHT have been nice but it has been neglected for a long, long time. It was sooooooooo depressing and grim. Not the sort of thing you want on a vacation, to be somewhere that you can't stand to spend one waking moment in the room. I would not say it was very dirty but it is extremely shabby. Torn curtains that are half hanging off rod and can't open or close (those were dirty as was bedspread but floor and bathroom was pretty clean if you overlook someone else's hairs on walls in shower etc). Torn and battered lamp. Room phones don't work. Very noisy old air conditioning unit. No water for shower or sink or to flush toilet for most of one day. Upstairs terrace has no water in the fountain and weeds in the planters, looked like no one had been up there for a long time. People that worked there seemed nice and friendly but the place itself is so darn unpleasant I would never recommend it to anyone!Also the neighborhood didn't feel very safe with bars on all the windows and broken sidewalks.

<Content>Disgusting! I had booked three nights at this hotel, but after one, had to cancel, and the nice hotel manager would only refund one of the two nights I didn't use. It was dirty: wet towel around the toilet, sink scum, and even burn marks on the water pitcher. For $110 (!) a night, you can do much better!

<Content>Bad even though I did not stay there I cancelled my reservation at the Hotel Iberia in San Juan, PR, immediately after reading about it on your site. Was really glad that I had done so when friends who stayed there confirmed that it was a dive. When I got home from my trip, I found that Cristobal, the manager, still had tried to stick me with a bill for two nights because he had not known of the cancellation. When I told him that I had spoken personally with him when I cancelled, he hung up on me. So, I had to cancel my creditcard to avoid further abuse.

<Content>Don't Even think About It ! I had to overnight in San Juan on Jan 20 and didn't know that on Jan 19-22 San Juan celebrates a big fiesta named la feria de la calle de San Sebastian. All the hotels were solid booked and the hotel Mgr who helped me found one room left at this Iberia Hotel.The outside looks pretty attractive with his spanish casa style and its little garden. The only room left was a 2 queen bedroom and the Manager (from Spain)priced it $132 because it was supposed to fit 4 people...Since my only other option to sleep in San Juan that night was the airport lounge...I paid and could see that the credit card receipt was untitled  garden supplies  ! So first thought = there is something strange about this hotel !!Room 307 has indeed 2 queen beds but of a terrible quality and then I found that there was no phone next to the phone directory !! + no shower head in the shower meaning that you cannot use it (great way to save water !) + no soap, no shampoo, no tooth cups, no washclothes...I could find one maid who brought 2 tiny soap bars and 2 plastic cups but that was it..The most unbeleivable is that there are metallic shades and a piece of vinyl as a window meaning that you are like sleeping outside and you get all the noise from the street, the parking lot and the building near the hotel. Of course I could not sleep more than a few hours and when I made my comments to the Mgr the next morning, he said that there were 150 guests in the hotel and that I was the only one to be complaining ...that to get a shower, we just need water and soap (his words !) + the phone line was down but no big deal etc...etc...I requested a partial refund but he said that even if I would have left the hotel the night before, he would have charged me because cancellation must be made 48hrs in advance !!!! Well, I don't think that I need to add anything to make the readers understand that you should NEVER pick up this hotel in San Juan even in the worse situations ! I would have accepted some conditions if I would have paid $50 but for $132 I felt totally exploited. So my recommendation is to stay away from this hotel and hopefully the Manager could know about all those bad feedbacks found in Tripadvisor. ODILE

<Content>Your reviews were right! This place is NOT worth the gamble. I just got back from San Juan Puerto Rico. My stay in San Juan was from Wednesday, March 24 through Monday, March 28, 2005. I stayed the first three nights at: Hotel Iberia I arrived at Hotel Iberia, on Wednesday, March 23rd at about 1:30 pm. I was shown to my room #206 by Israel. Later that day at about 3:30 pm I discovered that room #206 shower was only a 鈥渢rickle鈥?of water. There wasn鈥檛 enough water to shower. I contacted Israel and he came to the room #206 to inspect and observe the trickle of water coming out of the showerhead. I requested a room change. Israel said all rooms were occupied. I requested any means of showering possible. He said he didn鈥檛 have any alternatives. I requested to speak to the manager/ owner. He said there wasn鈥檛 any way of contacting him. He said Christopher the manager / owner will be here tomorrow (Thursday) and I could speak to him tomorrow evening. Israel also stated that tomorrow morning he would look into a room change. The next morning (Thursday, March 24th) at approximately 11:00 am I moved from room #206 to room #204. Room #204 shower barely had an adequate water pressure to shower. Late that evening at about 7:00 pm I spoke to Christopher the manager/owner of Hotel Iberia. (Israel had already made Christopher aware that I wanted to speak to him and the nature of the appointment to speak to him). I requested Christopher credit my account $80.00 for the first night because there wasn鈥檛 adequate water pressure to bathe. He said no credit would be issued and that he was aware of the nature of each room. Evidently Israel was also aware of the nature of room #206 shower not having enough shower water pressure to bathe. Israel and Christopher deliberately rented out room #206 that does not have adequate water pressure to shower. This place is NOT worth the gamble!

<Content>Not that bad for the price I stood at the hotel for 3 nights. I will see I have seen better but I have also stayed at much worse. I found the front desk to be polite and helpful. The rooms are very small but are kept pretty clean. I mean for the price, you can't ask for that much. The maid was very good at cleaning and organizing the rooms. Our airconditioner was fine the only thing that I found uncomfortable was the bathroom shower which I though could have been bigger.

<Content>Decent budget hotel---great location For a small, budget hotel, Hotel Iberia is certainly adequate. My room was very small and basic, but for $75 a night, it was worth it. The room and hotel was kept clean. The person at the front desk was helpful in recommending restaurants and was very willing to call a cab. The location is great--easy walking distance to the beaches, restaurants, and bars of Condado, and not far from Ocean Park, Isla Verde, and Santurce. It's a relatively short distance by cab to Old San Juan (it cost $10-$12).

<Content>Disappointed This weekend we reserved a room at this hotel for March 20th because we had a very important wedding to attend, our son's! We made the reservation by phone and considered ourselves very fortunate because of the long weekend involved. Our home is 3 hours away from the San Juan area so we were looking forward to our stay in the Condado area. You can imagine our outrage and disbelief when upon arriving we found that the hotel had rented our room to someone else! when I made the reservation, I indicated that I would be at my son's wedding in Isla Verde and that we would check in in the evening. Not only were the employees indifferent to our predicament, but they did not offer any consolation or solution to our situation. I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone. They obviously do not honor reservations nor do they care what happens to guests who have counted on fair practices. My weekend was ruined. Do not reserve.

<Content>Stay Away Where do I start. Booked 3 nights but stayed only 2 b/c I could only cancel  get a full refund for 1 night- and for that I had to endure the arrogance  mysoginism of the front desk Mgr. The lame un-helpful clerk for the 2 nights completed the experience. Early that night the elec. went out-there were no flashlights to pass around the only response from the clerk was a blank,don't care stare. This is a subpar place that misrepresents itself as a hotel. Their exterior small reception area is charming very Old World Spanish-this MUST be their bait. The Mgr pointed out that their customers are mostly traveling students-ie, the strapped for cash w/ no hostels nearby crowd. Room was dark w/very worn furniture,had an acrid smell that would not go away even though I left the pane windows open w/the a/c running, vynil shower curtains were coated w/soap scum,  a tiny awkward bathroom u had to step up to to get into (per Mgr all bathrooms were like this). It had an armoire instead of a closet  b/c of the lack of space TV was propped on a ceiling corner. I asked to see a larger room-it was worse- w/ the bedspreads threadbare.There is no elevator. It was $79 per night  this was NOT a good value as there ARE much better places for that price range-for example, the EL PRADO INN- so please check around. Anything good?: the maid kept the room dustfree.

<Content>beautiful hotel My husband and I needed a place to stay when our plane when our flight was cancelled. We found the owner to be extremely polite and helpful. The room was small but the decor was fablous. We stood on the rooftop cafe into the early morning listening to the sounds of Puerto Rico. The hotel is very well maintained with a beautiful garden outdoors. I highly recommed this hotel for those who like to travel off the beaten path.

<Content>Great for budget travelers I would definitely return to this hotel for another budget trip to San Juan. The room we had was small and the air conditioner a little loud, but the hotel is very clean and we felt safe walking back at night (2 men in our 30's). The staff is very friendly, the location is good (with a big 24-hour supermarket next door!!) and you can't beat the price at $88/night. The restaurant was being renovated during our stay, but there were plenty of places to get someting to eat and bring back to the room.
