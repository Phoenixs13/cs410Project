<Content>Expected more Stayed at the NTT house in December 2008 - in a so called suite with my family. It was 1600 HKD per night, that is around 160 EURO, not too cheap for university dorm. The suite was rather nice, but the kitchen was very worn-down and under-equipped (just three plates and four different cups... thats all!!!), only with fridge and microwave... not too useful... What are reasons for my (low) grade, are two things: firstly, they have very strict rules about house rules, but no one seem to enforce this rules, as the noise in other rooms and in the hallways is untorelable especially during late night hours (and no one reacts if you make a complaint); secondly, if you are not Chinese, you have problems communicating with staff, as their English is basic at best, and thirdly, TV programs are almost all in Chinese, expect of two programs that are part-English and several non-interesting international programms (Bloomberg, Deutsche Welle, RAI). They could do a lot better offering more English based TV chanells. Not everybody is Chinese!!
