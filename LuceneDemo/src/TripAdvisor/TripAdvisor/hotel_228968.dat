<Content>Definately a good choice I stayed in this hotel in November 2008 and before booking I was a little unsure about it because of some of the reviews I saw. First of all I will start by saying that as I travel to Florence often I always like to stay in a hotel that is close to SMN (Santa Maria Novella) so it is easy getting to and from Pisa airport. When arriving at this hotel the first thing I noticed was that this is the closest hotel to SMN station. I must admit there was some roadwork鈥檚 and I did read that this was a problem when getting to the hotel but you can simply avoid the roadworks by taking a shortcut by going down some stairs.When I arrived at the hotel I found the staff to be very welcoming and helpful. The rooms were very comfortable and fortunately for us we were given a free room upgrade with a Jacuzzi and really nice view of the town and a balcony. The room was not as large as some hotels that I鈥檝e stayed in but I must admit it was very homely and it鈥檚 rare that I have ever stayed in a hotel that makes me feel like I鈥檓 at home. The room service was very good and you can even order cocktails to your room with no extra service charge.The deco in the hotel rooms and throughout the hotel was extremely nice and had a typical Italian feel to it. We also visited the hotel bar on one or two nights and had a few cocktails, I must say the bar staff where very warm, welcoming and down to earth. The only downside to this hotel was that the breakfast stated hot American breakfast and the only hot food that was available was boiled or scrambled eggs. There were two breakfast rooms however the larger one straight ahead was too busy, where as the smaller room to the right was much nicer and not at busy. Apart from the issue with the hotel breakfast everything else about this hotel was perfect and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Not a 4-star establishment I must be in the Twilight Zone. The picture of the hotel is nothing like the one we stayed in. We were only there for one night on a tour, and it was undeniably the worst one night stay. Although clean, the hotel is shabby and worn. Because of the streets being ripped up, we had to lug our luggage from the tour bus and then lug it up the stairs because the elevator didn't work. The hotel is in what appears to be the worst neighborhood in Florence, next to the train station where you can hear people and trains coming and going all night. Why? Because there is no air conditioning so we had to leave our window open. We were told by our tour guide that they said it was off because of government regulations. I don't appreciate the deception.I wouldn't allow anyone I love to walk anywhere to or from this hotel at night as it is located to some sort of flophouse that also had folks coming and going all night. I have no idea what that was about, but it didn't feel safe. I am not a person who is hard to please.

<Content>Good location but breakfast can be chaotic Stayed here 3 nights for sight seeing in Florence. Good location right opposite the railway station. Room was clean, but breakfast let the hotel down badly. We were in a group of 16 tourists and as such was given a half hour slot for breakfast. We had to eat in an overflow room which was cluttered with too many plastic tables and chairs. Many tables were uncleared, and one had to fight your way to a table. What food there was, was very basic. Not even a toaster ! Coffee was awful. Next morning we dined individually in the main breakfast room which proved a little better as the tables had table cloths and were spaced out better. There was even a toaster here! Food wasn't much better though.I think this is a good hotel to stay on a room only basis, but the staff were indifferent and breakfast not worthwhile.

<Content>Good location, but that's all. A great location, beside the road from train station and walking distances from Florence tourist attractions.The hotel is old little neglected and the rooms are small. The price is excellent but you get what you pay.

<Content>Ambasciatori (City Residence) Hotel On arrival at the hotel we were told that we'd been upgraded, and directed to the newly renovated part of the hotel called the City Residence. We'd booked a luxury junior suite with jacuzzi. The new part of the hotel has a very tasteful entrance lobby, and we were directed to a room on the first floor. The room was at the front of the hotel facing the duomo, which could be seen in the distance. The room was very nicely decorated although a small. The jacuzzi was tiny, but tastefully decorated bathroom. There were doors that openned out onto a balcony, but where as in the past they must of had dividers between the balcony and the one next door, they no longer did, instead large holes in the concrete where these must have once been. So the balcony was rather communal. However the room was very comfortable, and with the balcony doors shut you couldn't hear the traffic.Breakfast the next day was rather an experience as the dinning room was obviously in process of being renovated. It felt like being in an army mess. Chaos really, tables uncleared, everyone milling around trying to get breakfast. Only the milk was off, the rolls had run out and there weren't any cereal bowls. We weren't impressed.However on the other days of our stay we were directed to a different dining room, lots of space, a TV and a breakfast room full of food, other people were being directed to the mess area !The hotel was very central and easy to walk to all the areas from, it was an enjoyable stay and I would go there again, so long as I had a similar room and the nice breakfast room.If you travel to Florence from Pisa airport, forget the train, the journey is horrible, it takes an hour, your lucky if you get a set, and it's heaving with school kids. It takes an hour to complete the journey and it's awful.We returned to the airport via the teravision coach, which only takes 10mins longer, and is a very relaxing experience. You can book a ticket in the bar next to the hotel. Make sure you book otherwise you may not get on.

<Content>Great Location, Great Service I stayed at this hotel in Sept '07 and have to say for me the location was fantastic. It's right across from the train station and pretty centrally located for the tour buses, and most attractions. The staff were very helpful and my room was very clean. The hotel has a very nice breakfast with lots of choices and is surrounded by some very good restaurants and cafes. My only problem was with the shower, which is totally open, I'm assuming that's a European style. But, it made showering an art in itself to keep from flooding the bathroom floor. When I return to Florence, I have every intention of using the Ambasciatori Hotel again.

<Content>Not as bad as what others are saying After reading so many mixed reviews about this hotel with such comments about noise, burglary and unhelpful staff. I was naturally concerened. But as I had already booked the holiday, there was no going back so we were prepared for the worse!After arriving at Pisa airport, getting into Florence was very straight forward. You arrive at Florence train station and once your outside, the Ambasciatori is litrally just on the door step. Yes its a very busy area- with lots of cars and buses whizzing round, but what do you expect from a hotel thats centrally located.Inside the hotel, you can block out the comotion going on outside. The rooms are clean and spacious. The bathroom had a recently been refurbished. We stayed in the back part of the hotel, overlooking the bus garage - these rooms tend to let in less noise apparently. So for the 4 days there, we heard no noise coming in from the outside. The only annoying noise was the slamming of doors, due to inconsiderate guests and the maids who thought having long chats outside our room every morning of our stay was part of thier job description. The breakfast provided was very good. The staff were very friendly and helpful. So all in all, for a budget get away, we highly recommend it.

<Content>Don't recommend this hotel. The hotel is much older than the pictures on their website. Our room is facing to a construction site. The worst thing is that the construction site started to have someone hammering at 8 or 9am so I had to wake up by 8 or 9 am. The sound insulation was not good. The only thing that i like is the location. very convenient.

<Content>Good comfortable hotel in central location Hotel is opposite main railway station  easy to find (leave railway station, turn right (towards bus station)  it's opposite. Checking in was easy with good English spoken. Great city advice given, free city maps, tour brochure etc. Tip: I recommend the tour company promoted by the hotel, CAF Tour  Travel but the hotel will take only cash not cards for payment of the tours. If, like me, you prefer to pay by card go to the tour company office (location down a lane near by  shown in the brochure)  pay by card there. Room  bathroom were clean  well decorated. Bed comfortable. I upgraded on the web when booking to get a double room for single use  it was worthwhile. There was a private balcony that overlooked the bus station (but not too noisy but I knew it was there) but it was cold when I was there  hardly used it. Breakfast was varied but no restaurant for evening meal or lunch. There were several nice restaurants around the hotel (try La Grotto Di Leo behind the hotel for a steak  atmosphere) so not a problem. I would stay there again.

<Content>Bed Bugs And Creepy Incident... But Great Location GREAT LOCATION, IF YOU DON'T MIND THE BUGS! ALSO BE VERY CAREFUL if you do decide to stay here...We had a very STRANGE incident occur during our stay at this hotel, which combined with the bed bug bites was enough for us to never want to stay at this hotel again. On the last day of our stay, a young man dressed in hotel uniform knocked on our door at around 9 am and asked me if he could check the refrigerator - to see if we'd consumed any of the beverages. I told him we had not, and he insisted on checking - I must check. Reluctantly I let him in, and was quite annoyed because he'd awakened me, and my mother was still asleep on the other bed. He proceeded to open the fridge, look around in it and then stare me up and down as if I was a piece of meat at the market (I was wearing a short sleep shirt) and giving me the creeps before he thanked me and left. He came back a second time, thirty minutes later, and asked if he could count the drinks again, which was really getting annoying and raising my suspicion levels to high alert, He kept staring at me the entire time. When he finally left - thank god!, I got dressed and went downstairs to the concierge demanding to know why this guy was in our room -TWICE! checking if we'd consumed any beverages when I'd already told him we had not! The hotel manager - a lady in her early 30's came down, along with the guy and proceeded to ask him in Italian (which I understand) if he'd asked for permission to enter the room before entering. He said I gave him permission. I told her there's ABSOLUTELY NO REASON for him to come in, especially when he's told there's a person sleeping in the room, just to count the drinks in the fridge, while making me feel VERY UNSAFE - TWICE!! I told them I don't want anyone entering our room, and informed them that most hotels count the drinks AFTER you check out, not while you're still sleeping at 9 am!! And once was certainly MORE THAN ENOUGH!! Besides, check-out was at 12pm! Be careful and ALWAYS FOLLOW YOUR GUT FEELING - DON'T LET THEM INTIMIDATE YOU IF YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH SOMETHING - YOU ARE PAYING THEM!!NOW, FOR THE LOCATION.....The location was great, right across the street from the train station. We stayed three nights and had no reservations upon arrival. We just walked in, because it's the first hotel directly across from the train station, and got the only available room -with no A/C for 100 euro, which the concierge said normally runs 150 euro. Whatever.. We didn't mind the A/C problem, although it was quite hot (July). The room had a huge walk-out balcony and faced the bus station, but we loved the price, which was amazing for peak season in Florence! As for the BUGS - I am sure they were bed bugs, because I was covered in bites and got more bites each night, and these weren't mosquito bites! They lasted for days, maybe 10-12 days. You can't beat the location however - just a 8-10 mins walk to the Duomo and the center of it all. AS FOR THE FOOD -- There's a great buffet inside the train station as well as a McDonald's - which I'd never consider as an option back home, however the McDonald's in Europe seem to offer different items on their menu, and their Deluxe Chicken Sandwich was exquisite! It's not available in the U.S. - I was bummed find out upon returning. It's grilled, delicious, filling and a total bargain! Actually even their basic burgers tasted so much better - like real beef! And their ice cream on a cone (cheap!) was a welcome treat in the Tuscan summer heat. The buffet at the train station had an AMAZING VARIETY of food, from fresh healthy salads to a HUGE variety of hot courses, pastries, rolls, croissants, gelatto, you name it! Yum! Very decently priced too - as you know meals can ruin your budget if you're careless. So we were quite thrilled to be seeing Florence for less than 120 euro per day including food! There's also a small grocery store right across the street from the Hotel, to the left of the station where you can grab fruit, veggies, chesse, bread, yogurt, etc. and make your own meal in a hurry. But they are closed on Sundays and close early on Saturday. The buffet place and McDonald's are open till 10 - 11 pm daily if I remember correctly, which is really amazing considering that most European markets close very early. I'd give this place five stars if it wasn't for those damn BUG BITES and that CREEPY, SUSPICIOUS MALE EMPLOYEE INCIDENT.

<Content>The Best Hotel in Florence, Probably We had 3 nights to be spent in Florence. Actually, we booked the BH Club Hotel but when we got there, they told us that we could get the room in BH Ambasciatori Hotel. An upgrade from 3 to 4 stars.The lobby was nice with very good service. The location was very good as well because is located right at the opposite of the Santa Maria Novella train station, only to cross the street and voila.The room was OK, not too small and not too big but the most important thing was that it provided a clean and nice private bathroom with toilet. Breakfast was OK although it provided the same food every morning. Everything was fine except for one moment when we just arrived and having our quality time together, suddenly one senior staff of the hotel came in to our room without knocking. We are very sure that we had closed and locked the door at that time and only can be opened by electronic key. However, she said sorry and left us. Maybe it's a good experience for the hotel to improve their staffs in order to check the occupancy before they want to come in to the rooms.Overall, I highly recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to go to Florence. Staffs were very nice and informative as well.

<Content>Well located good hotel We were a little apprehensive booking this hotel because of some negative reviews. We selected it because of its convenient location and price. Wewere pleasantly surprised. The room was clean and decent. The staff was very friendly and accomidating. The location is perfect if you arrive by train and all attractions are easily reachable by foot. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short stay in the city.

<Content>Pleasant Stay in Fabulous Florence My Husband and I arrived with our tour group in September of 2004. The first evening we spent overlooking a bus station, on what I assume was the backside of the hotel. There was an issue with the television and we were graciously relocated to another room overlooking the train station and center. We found the hotel to be clean and well appointed. It was fascinating to sit in the window of our room and watch all of the busy people buzzing about beneath us. There was a lovely view from our vantage point, of the duomo and surrounding area. There were not balconies on this hotel at the time of our stay. At least not in either of the rooms we were in. The second evening we made the decision not to join the tour group for dinner and ventured out on or own. The front desk kindly recommended a small trattoria a few blocks away. We made our way there easily, drinking in all of the sights and sounds along the way. The restaurant was fabulously quaint and friendly. They provided us with the most memorable meal of our entire stay in Italy, which spanned the entire country from North to South. The only down side to note, minor though it may be, was a bit of a surprise at checkout with the bill for our minibar. I'll never quite figure out how a few bottles of soda, a snack or two and a cocktail a piece came to ninety six euro. Oh My! From that experience we learned to use the in room bar as little as possible while staying in our other accomodations. Overall, our experience in this hotel and in Florence was wonderful an will always be one of our most memorable and pleasant experiences while on holiday in Italy.

<Content>Great Location and Comfortable Room Checking in took ages. The receptionist was incompetent. He attempted to check our party of 5 in as well as another party of 2 at the same time. When we asked him to deal with us before moving onto someone else, a reasonable request I thought, he hollered at us instead. We had to actually ask him to calm down!. The room was perfect though. It was big, clean, comfortable with excellent air con. The ensuite bathroom was big and the shower was excellent. The views of the Tuscan hills were lovely too.The breakfast however left a lot to be desired. We skipped breakfast for the rest of our stay as it was really below standard. The hotel's location was ideal. If you are staying here, don't waste your money on the breakfast, just eat out. All in all though it was a pretty good place to stay if you're booking last minute. If you've got time on your hands though, you could do better.

<Content>Safety/security seems to be a problem... As far as location and convenience, this hotel is hard to beat. Coming off of the train platforms at SM Novela Station, exit to the right and it is directly across the street. The rooms are relatively clean and if your requirement is for a basic room to shower and rest your head at night, the price is right.I liked the proximity of the central station- for catching buses, taking those hop-on, hop-off tour buses, getting a bite to eat at MacDonalds/McCafe when not wanting to sit down in a restaurant, etc. Getting out of town is also a breeze from here. The Duomo is a 15 min stroll away and nice to do in the evening.Consistent with what other guests have reported for this hotel, the attitude of the front desk staff leaves much to be desired- especially when it is busy. Tours seem to book here so you may find the front lobby packed with tourists who are gathering to either check-in, check-out or assemble for a guided tour. Something that I found to be disturbing/discouraging was to see upset guests, at different times of the morning, filling out forms because they were burglarized (while in their rooms!). I wonder if we were OK only because it was screaming hot in Milan in late July when we stayed here and we had the air-conditoner going full blast through the night while the windows and doors were locked tight.Any hotel should be very concerned about the safety and security of their guests. People appear to get robbed here, so that is something to keep in mind when you book a room here. The location is great and just make sure you lock all of the doors and windows when you sleep.

<Content>Hotel Diplomat/Ambaciatore We booked a reservation with the Hotel Diplomat through Expedia but when we checked in they sent us next door to its sister hotel, Hotel Ambaciatore (if im spelling it right). we stayed on the fourth floor. are you ready for this...... we were ROBBED in the middle of the night WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING!! yes i said we were in the room ---two females sleeping. Someone scaled the pole to the fourth floor and came in through our balcony window leading to the bathroom and took our bags and the chair that was in the room back outsided and proceeded to go through them outside on the balcony. took our money, camera, and blackberry. but kindly left our belongings on the balcony lined up nicely to scale back down the pole to the ground floor. We were sleep through all of this (I guess we were that tired or they were professionals) thank goodness we didnt wake up in the middle of the thiefs escapade! we reported it to the front desk and manager the next morning and their response was yeah it happens often unfortunately.... so if you like being violated in the middle of the night..then stay here!!

<Content>STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL This hotel has the most uncaring staff I've ever witnessed. Our hotel room was burglarized while we slept in our beds. No one was injured thankfully, but the hotel displayed a no-care attitude. They never sent a staff person up to the room when we called down to report the intrusion. They made us wait while they checked people in and out before giving us the insurance forms to fill out and made us wait once again while they copied the forms for us. They never apologized and basically treated us like we didn't exist. Stay away from this one - there's plenty of hotels in Florence.

<Content>clean hotel, good amenities We stayed here one night~ very close to SMN Florence station, so very convenient. Not on the greatest looking street~ doesnt do much justice to Florence. Staff were OK; not very helpful, nor friendly. The rooms are spacious and clean and the bathroom was good. No shower grip or curtain so beware of a flooded bathroom, powerful shower though. Duomo and all other attractions very nearby, 10min walk. So location wise its good. we paid around 鈧?0 for the night with continental breakfast (it was so so). The a/c is more like a heater than a cooler so that needs to be a caution during peak seasons. I would go back again. Rooms are clean, spacious and bathroom is modern and the location is convenient. Just dont expect friendly service with a smile!

<Content>Great value for money place to stay in Florence I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights after booking via last minute.com. After reading some of the reviews on here I was quite worried about staying here. However I'd like to pass on that our stay was fantastic. The staff were friendly and helpful and all spoke good English. The room was spacious, clean, well equipped and had a very modern bathroom. Even the mini bar was reasonably priced! The hotel has car parking - very helpful if you hire a car.The area is pretty noisy however I felt it was quite nice to be in the hustle and bustle of the City. If you want quiet go on a weekend break to the countryside! We did see a few beggars around the hotel, however no more than you would find in comparable areas of London. All the main sights are within 10 mins walk. There is no evening restaurant - so what. There is an amazing choice of reasonably priced Trattoria's in Florence.For the price we paid this place is a bargain!

<Content>value for money My husband and I spent 3 nights here in Feb 2007. I was a bit worried after reading some of these reviews so went with fairly low expectations.The hotel is directly opposite the main railway station which was very handy and meant we could settle in quickly and start our sight seeing. The staff were ok but not over friendly. The room was clean and comforable. The shower room excelent, well stocked, clean and newly refurbished. Breakfast was continental and plenty of it, loved the pastries but the fruit was tinned.The only drawback was the noise from the busy street below. We lowered the outside blind at night which helped a bit but still found it hard to get a good nights sleep. The bed was really comfortable though.All in all we had a great time in Florence and got such a great deal with last minute - it even included free box of chocolates in our room and great BA flights. You can walk to all the attractions from this hotel and see the Duomo dome from the hotel bedroom window.

<Content>Noisy and unfriendly I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my boyfriend and from walking out of the SM Novella train station we were immediately taken back by the traffic surrounding the hotel, the beggars and vagrants on the street, the noise and the smell!We tried to keep an open mind, but on the first night realised that the noise would be a problem because the windows were so thin! Every hour an emergency vehicle would drive past sirens blazing...it was SO loud! The other noise that kept us awake was the bubbling of the toilet, sink and bath during the early hours of the morning! It was very worrying as we thought they would start to bring things back from beyond!! :-(Not that I want to put everyone in the same basket, but I always thought that Italian's would be so friendly and welcoming, but I have to say that I was shocked by some of the rudest people I've ever met. They were abrupt, they wouldn't look at you to serve you, they served other people (who happened to be Italian) before you even though you were cleary at the front of the queue.We booked the trip through Lastminute and when we got to Stanstead we had to pay an extra 拢7 each to check in our luggage...surely when you're flying this should be included in the price, but apparently Lastminute don't include it. Then in Pisa Airport we had to pay 11 Euros each to check them in again! Lastminute also said that the hotel served an American breakfast, so we went thinking there would be pancakes, waffles etc...but it was more like a continental breakfast - but not even that really!The only advantage to staying at this hotel in Florence was that everything was in walking distance for sightseeing. Many of the sights were very grand and amazing to see.

<Content>So noisy I stayed with my husband in this hotel for four nights. I consider myself a fairly seasoned traveller, which is why I wasn't too bothered by the area around the train station being seedy and why i wasn't expecting the hotel to be like 4 star hotels in the UK or the US. However 2 main problems1) The noise - it was dreadful. The hotel is near to a police training school and there were sirens all night, not to mention the buses, the street cleaning vehicles and the homeless people shouting.2) The bar - they advertise your first drink is free. This is a bit of a con and they try to add it on your bill when you check out - so stand firm!It is good to be close to the station but Florence is so small everywhere is in walking distance anyway.

<Content>Take it -- if the price is right I had actually booked a room at the Diplomat Hotel next door (same management), but for unexplained reasons I was upgraded to the Ambasciatori. As others have pointed out, the hotel is on a busy street just opposite the W side of Florence's main train station (Santa Maria Novella), and early buses/garbage trucks are likely to wake you up early (well, they certainly woke ME up, and I am a very heavy sleeper!). Probably the problem could be resolved if you can get a room facing on the back street.My room was more than adequate as a single (but the queen size bed could be a problem for a large couple). The bathroom was new and actually larger than the room itself.The buffet breakfast was abundant, varied, and excellent.All in all, and in spite of the noise, If you can get a room at the same price I paid via one of the many hotel booking websites (48 euro incl. breakfast) it's a no-brainer!

<Content>Location has its drawbacks When I see the description of this place as being modern, yet built in 1930, I must remember that Florence is filled with ancient buildings so this one is considered modern. The hotel is a little rundown but certainly is adequate. The best (and also the worst) part is the location, on a very busy thoroughfare right across from the train station. The noise was terrible, although we were lucky to be on an upper floor which kept the noise down somewhat. The area of town around the hotel is so-so. However, we walked day and night and always felt safe. The pizza and pasta restaurant two doors down from the hotel was our salvation. The menu was perfect for American taste and the waitstaff very accommodating. We ate there every night because the hotel does not serve dinner. We had no problems with our room. The bathroom had been remodeled very nicely but was quite small. Again I emphasize that the location was great. We walked to everything because all the attractions were nearby.

<Content>Not a 4-star hotel. We stayed here as part of a group tour through northern Italy. Of the 21 rooms occupied by our group, at least 7 rooms had problems such as foul odors and non-functioning air-conditioning and the occupannts requested a room change. The first room we were given was tiny  the a/c didn't work. The room they gave us next was handicap-accessible and was much larger, with a huge bathroom. The bathroom, however, had no put-down space at all  we had to move a small table from the bedroom into it. The neighborhood is very seedy and we were uncomfortable walking around there at night. There are better choices in beautiful Florence.

<Content>Disappointed with noise and service My family stayed in two rooms for three nights in Rooms 112 and 115. The accommodations were fine. Unfortunately though, we were on the first floor of the hotel and when the windows were open for fresh air, the noise from the train station was horrible. At 8 AM on April 18, there was major construction going on in the hotel. They were using jackhammers on concrete and doing regular hammering. We, of course, hadn't been warned of this. It was just a few doors down from us. If you are booking there soon, check on that construction.I asked for two days for the clerks at the desk to check on our airline flights (because that is what we were told to do). They gave excuse after excuse and never checked. When we arrived in Pisa for our flight, we found that it had been cancelled.

<Content>Don't be afraid! Boy after reading some of the reviews on here I was more than a little scared of what I was going to find at the Hotel Ambasciatori. Well I am pleased to say that my experience was a good one. My room was spotless. The location was fine. I travelled alone and I did not feel unsafe even once. Florence is small so you can pretty much walk from one end of the city to the other (if you are adventurous). The staff was terrific. The made dinner reservations for me, called taxis...whatever I needed. Only thing is there is no restaurant in the hotel so you have to go outside for meals (except for breakfast). I had a really good time. Remember the San Lorenzo market and the Academia Museum are closed on Mondays (at least in the off season) so plan accordingly. CIAO!

<Content>awful I checked into Ambasciatori for a week long business trip only to find the internet connections I was assured they had in every room were TELEPHONE LINES, and they did NOT provide a dial up number (my company is completely broadband). Additionally, there was no air conditioning in the rooms and no fewer than 50 mosquitoes shared my room the first evening. After finding a hotel that offered not only high speed but wireless (and a/c!) in every room, I attenpted to check out to be told that I would have to pay for 4 nights stay. I asked to see the cancellation policy, was told that could not be provided to me. This hotel is not to be recommended for TOURISTS AND DEFINITELY NOT serious business traveler. So, they stole over 500 euroes from me to let me leave the hotel. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!

<Content>Living like an aristocrat As we arrived from Venice via ic train, the hotel was directly across from the station. One would think this would bring you a somewhat dingy or low-priced hotel, but upon entering through the doors, it was like being in a castle. Our room included a bidet, shower, jacuzzi and of course the mini-bar which is standard in most European hotels these days. Breakfasts were wonderful with fresh yogurts, cheeses, breads and meats, staff polite and very helpful, rooms beautiful and spacious.Red bus for sightseeing proved to be a real bargain. Bus A and B for same amount, 20 Euros/ea took one to both the city sights and Tuscany. Very wise investment. A block down on the left from the hotel sits the Tratorria where you will find a nice mix of cultures eating some of the most wonderful Italian meals you'll ever have. Well worth the walk. Seeing David was out of the question. We asked upon arrival at hotel and were told he was booked for the next week. Reserve your time prior to leaving the states or you may not get to see him either. We were able to view the other David during one of our tour rides. We found Florence to be a bustling city with many, many sights, but were a little disappointed since we were expecting a small romantic, quiet wine sort of town.

<Content>rattly windows The location of the hotel was good for us as we arrived by train. We were initially given a room with a walk in shower suitable for a disabled person but quickly found that when you took a shower the water flooded the bathroom and the bedroom! We complained and were offered a change of room immediately (they obviously knew there was a problem). Our second room had a bath but the water/drainage problems were still evident. If we didn't keep the plug in the bath when the next room used their shower water came up through our plug hole! One major problem we had was rattly windows - each morning at 6 o'clock when the buses started to run they caused the glass in our windows to rattle. Many previous guests had tried to stop this by putting pieces of paper in place of the missing putty but it didn't work! The room itself was nicely decorated and furnished and we found breakfast to be adequate but not brilliant. We found staff to be friendly and helpful. The local area was typical of the area around most city railway stations not the best area of town! However we didn't have any problems.There was a useful store opposite the hotel for water and picnic food (and wine) and a launderette in the road behind the hotel. Alongside the hotel there was a cheap restaurant Pastarito(part of a chain) which served huge portions of pasta and great salads and was good value. On the whole we have stayed in worse places but if we went back to Florence we would stay elsewhere

<Content>Great location, terrible breakfast Having spent 3 nights here last week...Pros:- great location: at Santa Maria Novella Station, face the platforms and look left. You can see the hotel sign through the station exit doors.- big rooms  clean too, with sheets changed every day- pretty good value at 拢60 per twin room per night, though I wouldn't pay more to stay hereCons:- we were on the 5th floor, which is the top floor. The air conditioning in one of our 2 rooms was way below par and just not cold enough. We asked for a change the following morning and were obliged immediately.- water problems: the entire 5th floor (and possibly 4th and 3rd floors) had no water for a day. That day was a public holiday in Italy so the receptionist - having had to deal with complaints from many guests - said that it had been very difficult to get someone to come and fix the problem because of the holiday. Anyway, we were immediately offered a change of rooms to the 2nd floor, where water pressure was ok. Also on the 2nd floor, the rooms we had had independent A/C units (which were very good), as opposed to the integrated-into-the-wall vents on the 5th floor, which weren't very good at all.- finally, the drinks at breakfast were a real let-down. On the one hand, we are in Italy and the best an allegedly 4* place can manage is vending machine coffee?!! Similarly they didn't even have fresh fruit juice, or indeed juice that resembled any kind of fruit. Again, it was juice from a vending machine, which - at a guess - basically mixes some kind of nasty orange powder with water, to give you a glassful of something that you could probably disinfect something with.- However, the bread/pastries/etc were fine.- As the last review mentioned, there did always seem to be someone at reception with a grievance to be sorted out.

<Content>It's clean, but that's about it... Stayed at the Ambasciatori for two nights as part of our Globus Tour. The picture shown taken at a distance makes the outside look nicer than it is. When we pulled up, I immediately thought Eeww!, as it's located in a busy metro kind of area. My husband and I walked around the neighborhood in the early evening when we noticed a man do an immediate 180 and follow us. He wasn't even subtle about it. My husband looked him right in the face, gave him a mean glare and he backed off. Kind of creepy. The staff isn't the friendliest as others have noted, but I didn't find them to be nasty either. The breakfast was simply awful. The second day we were there we had no water at all. When we did have water, it literally dribbled out of the showerhead, and still somehow managed to create a minor flood on the floor. The only good I can say is that the room was clean and decorated decently, but that's about it.

<Content>Very average rather than excellent I have just returned from 5 wonderful days in Florence where I stayed for 4 nights in the Ambasciatori Hotel.The hotel is situated directly next to the main Santa Maria Novella train station where almost all visitors arrive. All I had to do was walk down in steps and enter directly into the hotel. For me it really was a great location and I felt safe at all times.I arrived at 12 noon, 2 hours before the official check-in but was allowed to book straight in and given my room immediately. Although the staff were unhelpful I let it slide as I wanted to get straight to my room and was grateful of the early check in. The hotel staff are all unfriendly and offer very little help if they can get away with it. The staff for me were the worst part of the stay, but more on that later.On first sight the room was absolutely marvellous. A double all to myself with lots of space, clean and tidy throughout and a nice large bathroom. The view from my balcony was spectacular and it was amazing to sit and view the sun rise over the mountains with the Duomo, Bell Tower and Baptistery directly in view.So that is all the good things to say and onto the bad. Firstly, everytime I asked at reception for some kind of help it was given begrudgingly and really none of the staff seem to want to be working at the hotel. Not one of them seems happy in there job. When I enquired how to pre-book tickets for the Uffizi gallery the response was to just go and wait in line. This was obviously not the answer I was looking for and when I explained that if you pre-booked you didn't have to queue, I just got a blank response. I can quite categorically say the hotel staff were the most unhelpful I have every come across in any country. I could go on and on with more examples but I am sure you get the picture. It is also worth noting that everytime you pass the reception it seems someone is complaining about something or other, even when it is empty and has few guests.Now back to the room. After my initial positive reaction on closer inspection there were faults. The mini bar was stocked full of over priced goods but was not switched on. The air conditioning was working but it does not switch anywhere near cool enough and seems to be regulated by the front desk, even if you set it on the lowest. My toilet continued to leak noisily after flushing for hours on end. My shower was not very powerful and problems with the water system meant it flooded with water that did not go down the plug hole. Although the problems were reported, nothing was done for my entire stay.The breakfast was really very sub standard. The coffee machine was out of milk 2 of the 4 days. It uses powdered milk and has to be the worst coffee in Florence. The fruit juice machine over watered and it tasted disgusting. The rest of the continental breakfast was enjoyable and the restaurant staff did there best.The bar was closed every single night of my stay, no doubt due to the lack of people staying at the hotel. However, I would have thought this was a basic service that should have still been available.Finally, my hotel safe stopped working on my last day. I didn't worry too much about this as it only held my passport and 60 Euros. However, on my return after another great day of sightseeing I was stunned to find that 20 Euros was missing out of the wallet. I have absolutely no doubt it was taken by the maid or a member of the hotel staff who had access to my room. I was very disappointed and will write to the hotel group direct as the hotel would have done nothing.To finish things off in style I was told I had took a bottle of water from the mini-bar which was absolutely not the case and it was only after a discussion that I was not charged for it.Any UK or USA visitors will be very, very disappointed if you book into this hotel. The service and standards are not what we are used to. A large hotel with very little to offer the 4* rating is really closer to 2 making it vastly overpriced. Florence offers far better 2* and 3* hotels almost everywhere you look and on checking into this on my return I feel I paid way over the odds. Please take the time to look online for somewhere else because you'll be setting yourself up for a big disappointment if you stay at the Ambasciatori Hotel in Florence.

<Content>Some what disappointing It was nice to be close to the train station. When we arrived we had reservations for 2 rooms, traveling with older kids. They only had the reservation for one room. They did get us two rooms but they were not together. We were put on the 5th floor. Unfortunately the air conditoners on the floor were not working. They were getting several complants when we were checking in, the front desk assured me and the people complaining that they would be fixed soon. They were not fixed and they knew they were not going to be fixed soon. I had a conversation in the morning with the front desk and had to make them agree to put me on a floor where the A/C was working if the A/C was not fixed by the time we got back later in the day. Well the A/C was not fixed and we had to move to the 2nd floor. The rooms were Ok, clean. The breakfast was better than average. This place seem to have several tour groups staying there. I believe there are nicer places to stay in Florence than this hotel. But is was not bad.

<Content>Ambasciatori - probably not again The location of this hotel is in a marginal area. In order to get to the hotel from the center of town you have to cross in front of the train station which has a reputation as the drug dealing center of town. I never felt personally threatened but not comfortable enough to let my 2 teenagers go back to the hotel unaccompanied. Our stay started out poorly. First they put us in a room with broken AC (on a 95 degree day) and then acknowledged that they knew about the problem and were informed by maintenance that it could not be fixed. They changed our room but I thought it was an incredibly sleazy move. Rooms were clean. Breakfast was mediocre.

<Content>Wish we had the chance! My wife  I booked in for a long week-end and after a crack of dawn flight from London, a walking tour of Pisa we arrived at the hotel around 3.30pm to check in only to be informed that the hotel had a water problem and that we couldn't stay there! At first we were told we could stay at the Hotel Adler Cavalieri (4*) but then told it would be the Hotel Diplomat which is part of their chain of hotels. As it was a 3* hotel I declined this and was again offered the Adler. I agreed to look it over but was annoyed to be told that it would only be for 1 night and we would have to move back to the Ambasciatori for the remaining 2 nights. I did not intend to spend precious time changing hotels and after much discussion it was agreed that we spend all 3 nights at the Adler which turned out to be a very pleasant hotel and one which I can recommend. It was annoying that the hotel had not e mailed me so that I was aware of their problem, or that they expected us to stay at a 3* or move during my stay. All turned out well in the end but the way in which it was dealt with did not impress me! I suggest that if you are booked at this hotel you confirm availability the day before you arrive!
