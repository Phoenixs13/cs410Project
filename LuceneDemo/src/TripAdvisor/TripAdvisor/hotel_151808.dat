<Content>We liked it!! My friend and I stayed at the Hotel Villa del Sol and we thought it was great. We stayed in room 205 and it was very clean, did not stink, and had no bugs. The air conditioner worked and our water pressure although not very strong, did the job (The water pressure throughout the entire island is not strong so I do not blame the hotel). We thought the hotel was very cute but wished that the pool did not close as early as it does which is 6 pm. The lady at the bar is VERY nice and made me a great pina colada and a delicious burger for my friend. Overall, I have no complaints and plan on going back to the island next year and staying at the Hotel Villa del Sol with my husband.

<Content>Don't do it! We booked this hotel on the recommendation of relatives that live in Puerto Rico. (I'm thinking they picked it just because, not because they'd had any dealings with the hotel) Anyway, the hotel has a lot of charm and is clean (except for the carpet) with a friendly and helpful staff, but that's as much praise as I'll give it. Our room was SMALL and musty smelling. There were those little tiny black ants in the bathroom. The knob on the bathroom sink came off with a lift. The shower handle was a challenge. There wasn't much play to the handle. The first night my husband ended up taking a cold shower because he hadn't figured out the trick to get the handle to turn in order to have hot water. The two other groups of family members staying at the hotel didn't get a shower the first night, because the hotels power went off/surged for a moment, thus rendering the hotel waterless for a couple of hours, apparently a common accurance. Thin pillows like the other review said. Also, amazed that there are no hand towels and only one wash cloth besides the two bath towels and bath mat. The street noise, people walking by talking, etc. are very noticable, as if the window were open when it wasn't. And to finish, we were there for four nights, and on the last night, I discovered the carpet is in desperate need of a shampooing. I put on a pair of socks after a day on the beach and had them on maybe, ten minutes, and had made a few trips around the room, back and forth to the bathroom, etc. then sat down on the bed and caught a look at the bottom of my feet--my white socks were black, YUCK! I'm glad that I hadn't noticed this on the first day, 'cause that would of made the stay that much worse, knowing what I was walking on and going to be walking on for the rest of my vacation. Similar complaints from our other family members staying at the hotel. I'd never stay there again...charm is wonderful, but so are a ton of other things.

<Content>don't go to Villa Del Sol I was very disappointed with this hotel. The towel rack fell on my head and was never fixed! The water pressure was very low. Our room was extremely small  was not cleaned every day.The bar tender was not fluent in English, but was very pushy about ordering food. We were told we couldn't bring snacks to the pool, we had to order off of the menu.Our in-laws room had ants  a bucket under the toilet because it leaked. Some of our family were told they had to pay more for their room when they checked in  they didn't want to give receipts for cash payments!

<Content>Nice  I was a little concerned when I read the reviews from Hotel Villa De Sol, after I had already made my reservations. I read how the staff, was unfriendly, and how the rooms were not in the best of shapes. Although it鈥檚 every one person opinion, the reviews worried and scarred me to possibly canceling and going with a higher priced Hotel in the area. Since this was my first trip to the Island I wanted it to be nice, something I can talk to my friends about. After considering it for a long time, I decided to keep the reservation. To my surprise I was happy that I did not cancel. The hotel was lovely, the front desk staff were very friendly, especially the lady that serves in the bar area. (Loved the coffee she made), the price was great, comparing the surrounding hotels. The room was clean, and the bed made daily. The bathroom was cleaned and had hot water. I have seen worse!! In the time that I was there I did not see any type of bugs in the room, which I was very very happy about. I would have to say that they do not have the best parking arrangement, but since I did not have a car I was not worried about that. I鈥檓 planning my next trip, this time I鈥檓 staying longer, and I will defiantly stay at Hotel Villa Del Sol.

<Content>Bad Service Small bed room, really small bath room. No elevators, and no body help you with your luggage. At the front desk the service is terrible, they say they have free parking (if you are lucky, you get block the car of another customer). No room service, the TV is small. I paid in cash and leaved a deposit wich they told me they will send it back to me, I`m still waiting for it. Not expensive, but there are better places to stay for a little more.

<Author>Frequent-Flyer-Mommy
<Content>Horrible - Stay Elsewhere My family and I stayed here from July 12-15. We had 3 rooms booked. One that slept 6 and the other 2 that were double rooms. The room we originally were given had water stains on the ceiling and a very musky smell. Upon entering the room I went to the bathroom to wash my daughters face and realized there was very little water pressure. By very little I mean a trickle. There was no way someone could bathe (much less 6 people). I immediately went to the desk and explaiend the problem. They seemed aware of it but the gist of our conversation was there was no way it would be fixed before our stay was over. I requested another room and was offered one on the first floor that only had 2 beds in it with the promise of 2 cots. The room was next to the bar and extremely noisy. Under normal circumstances this would not have bothered me but with all the other issues this just added to my displeasure here. I called the owner and complained. She was not in any way apologetic and when I threatened to leave she said they would charge me for the 3 nights. The other two rooms were musky and generally in poor condition. I travel to Puerto Rico about 4-5 times a year and have stayed at many hotels both budget and higher end resorts. I wanted to try this place as the website made it look very decent. Basic accomodations are never a problem for me as long as the hotel is clean and the service is adequate. Here neither is the case.This was, quite possibly, the worst service I have ever received. The front desk staff was rude and unresponsive, the manager was just as bad, and the owner was indifferent. I was embarrassed as I was travelling with people that had never been to the island and they were left with a bad impression of the service provided in hotels.If this is your budget then stay at the Coral Princess in Condado. Same prices and much better service.

<Content>I do not understand the good reviews. Horrible room, uncaring staff, very rude owner. It looked so quant from the photos but the room was an absolute dump and I have stayed in quite a few Motel 6 and similar. The very small room with a great view of the parking lot and trash bins (that were noisily utilized all night) had an uncomfortable old mattress with no mattress pad and no blanket (you use the bed cover I guess). The sheets were so thin I could easily see the mattress print. Towels were thin with rips and holes and the towel rack was hanging from the wall. There was a 1/2 inch gap to the outside around the noisy air conditioner and the shower temperature control was broken. (They stated they wanted to send in an outside handyman into my room to fix the shower and wanted to know if it was okay. Since when does a hotel not take responsibility for who they send in?) The mirror was a medicine cabinet that was not under the light and would not stay closed because the magnet was missing. I had to shave with one had on the mirror holding it closed. The CAT5 phone line was just punched though the wall with a two inch hole and then ran down the outside of the wall. The walls were cracked and paint lifted from mold or water damage or who knows what. I kept expecting a [--] come through the door any minute.Also all the basics you take for granted were missing such as hangers, an iron, a pen and pad, a hook on the back side of the door for your toiletry bag, etc... I guess what was irritating was that 90% of the problems could have been fixed with $50 and an hour of their time.Also note that they require a copy of your driver鈥檚 license and credit card and do not destroy it or give it back when you leave. They keep it on file forever they said. What?!?!?I gave up after one night and headed across the street to Embassy Suites. For $50 more and I got a very nice suite with a TV/wet bar sitting area and separate nice bedroom overlooking the pool. It even included free breakfasts. And best of all it was run like a real hotel by nice caring staff. However, it was even closer to the airport and noisy out by the pool during plane take off. All other decent hotels were at least double the cost though.I usually prefer small BB and private hotels but this one was a major disappointment to put it mildly. Some friends arrived the next day and also had horror stories and left after one night. They were so glad to get out. I鈥檇 avoid it at all costs.

<Content>Enjoyable Experience Spud Island PEI Canada Just came back from a week in Puerto Rico. Stayed at the Villa del Sol 3 nights and rented a car from them to tour the island. I must say that we were very pleased with the service from both the hotel staff and the car rental. When we got there we had unknowingly reserved the smallest room they had but since we were renting a car they upgraded us to a very nice room with a balcony overlooking the pool. The hotel is just up the street from the beach and close to all amenities.Yes the planes do make quite a noise from their engines however they stop around 10:00 and we had no problem sleeping.The beds were very comfortable and the staff were extremely friendly. We would certainly stay here again and would also recommend it to our friends. The only complaint that I have is that there is no elevator which makes carrying bags up to the second floor hard but there were no elevators in the other hotels we stayed in either.

<Content>Good location, nice pool area This hotel has friendly staff, rooms are average, but equipped with TV, and A/C. The pool area is nice, and beach areas are within walking distance. Mattress on the bed was not great, but overall recommend this hotel for a good place to stay for a night or two.

<Content>small, but clean and affordable We just needed a place to stay for the night before we flew out. I prefer staying at smaller quaint places with personality, rather than hotel chains. Going by trip advisor recommendations, I thought I'd give this place a shot. I couldn't believe the price! San Juan prices were all high, and at $90 a night, I was a little nervous about what I was getting in to. But it wasn't bad! Pros are the bar, the pool, the patio upstairs, the cleanliness. The staff was nice, and it was close to the beach. There's a cafe on the corner across the street to get coffee in the morning.Cons: It was difficult getting the luggage up the stairs. Whatever they use to clean the bathrooms smelled way too strong, almost nauseating, so we bought some incense and it made the smell go away. No coffee in the rooms or in the lobby. The air conditioner was a little loud, but it turned out good for drowning out the sounds of the airport. If you don't plan to spend too much time in the room it was sufficient just to sleep. The bathroom was small, but the shower had pretty good pressure and water was hot. All in all, I would stay there again, but I would check out the bigger more expensive rooms if I needed more than one night.

<Content>Pleasant Surprise! This hotel was a beautiful surprise. Its nestled away next to all the big names in Isla Verde, for a fraction of the price. After a short (and terrible) stay at the Howard Johnson, I found this hotel for the remainder of our 5 day stay. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The bartender was especially nice! The hotel is pretty new with a nice pool and location. The rooms were super clean everyday of our stay, no matter how messey we made it. Its close to the beach and airport. (Althought it is close to the airport, the noise is not audible inside the room, only outside. Overall, I loved the place. I'll stay there everytime I go to San Juan. Thank you!

<Content>Had a Hard time Sleeping I book the rm for 3 days and 2 nights but regret it because the bed was not confortable at all. I could'nt sleep at all on that first night, there was no cushing to the bed and it seem that I was sleeping on a Hard Cardboard box. It was a nightmare. As for the second night, I did not sleep there at all but, I did have some friend's come over and had a blast with them.

<Content>I would highly recommend it! I recently stayed at Villa Del Sol for 3 nights and I really enjoyed my stay. It IS NOT a fancy or swank hotel. But it is clean, safe, the employees were extremely friendly, and the location is second to none. It is literally right next door to the El Suan Juan Hotel, which in my opinion, is the nicest hotel in Isla Verde. It is also a quick 3-4 minute walk to the beach. If you are on a budget and want to stay in Isla Verde, this is your place.

<Content>Would not recommend Villa del Sol My husband and I had a reservation to stay here for one night. We checked into our room and lugged our furniture up the stairs (no elevator). The sheets on the bed were thin and rough and there was no mattress pad. My husband went downstairs to ask for a mattress pad and after 10 minutes someone came and threw one in his lap. We then conferred with each other and decided to try and stay somewhere else. When we went to the clerk and told her we would not be staying there for the night she said she would not refund our money because it took us over 10 minutes to let her know we would not be staying. I told her that she had never informed me of the ten-minute rule and asked if there was a manager on duty. She said no. I asked if there was a manager she could call that I could talk to. She called someone, supposedly the manager, and spoke in Spanish to this person, but would not let me get on the phone. She told me they were still going to charge us for the night because it had taken us 20 minutes to let her know. We immediately called our credit card company and filed a complaint. They assured us we would not have to pay the charge. Bad, bad experience. We went to the Embassy Suites across the street and paid $200 more, but it was worth it.

<Content>Okay For A Night Or 2 We were traveling in a group of 14 and stayed one night before a cruise. We picked this hotel because it was not expensive, had a bar  a pool for the kids... The bar was great, the beer is really cold!BUT the pool closes at 6:00 so the kids really didn't get to use it when we arrived - there was a pool table that they used for the better part of the evening. The rooms were clean but the beds were very noisy  floors seemed damp. This hotel is right in the path of the airport run ways so you do hear planes taking off... but not so much to prevent you from sleeping.. Overall it is a decent clean hotel for a night but wouldn't have stayed any longer especially in this area of San Juan - Stay here if you're really tight on budjet but you get what you pay for.... I recommend paying a little more  staying in Old San Juan or Condado the areas which are much nicer  closer to the peir.

<Content>Decent small hotel for first few nights in town Pros:- Rooms were recently remodeled and clean- Staff was nice and helpful (although you often had to wait for them to finish a phone call first)- 5 minute drive from airport and 5 minute walk to beachCons:- Just next to flight path for incoming jets. Noise was not unbearable due to dual-pane windows, but still noticeable. Could also hear people in neighboring room.- Pool closed after 6pm- Our room had some broken light fixtures which weren't fixed during our stay.

<Content>It's a wonderful place My boyfriend and I loved our stay (5 nights) at Hotel Villa Del Sol. We didn't have a prior reservation, but they managed to accommodate us and give us excellent rates. When I walked in, I asked one of the employees regarding their amenities; she included the employees as one. At the time, I was a bit skeptical due to our interaction with other hotel employees, but she was absolutely right. We were treated wonderfully. Don鈥檛 forget to try Annette鈥檚 margaritas and Carmen鈥檚 Pina Colladas (?). Villa Del Sol is cute, clean and affordable. This place has a lot of character. You will definitely enjoy your stay. FYI, the car rental guy, Carlos (he is not one of their employees), was the only unpleasant person we dealt with at the hotel. You might want to stay away from him.

<Content>Loved Villa del Sol Me and my best friends stayed at Hotel Villa del Sol for five days and, we had a great time!! Before booking the hotel I had read the reviews in this site, and I was terrified to go there, but this was a very affordable hotel and we booked it in spite of all the bad reviews. I must admit I was pleasantly surprise! This hotel, first of all, is small, but beautiful. The hotel staff was always courteous. The bar had all the drinks we wanted at a very low price. The pool was small but always warm and clean. The room was spaceous, and clean. The beach is very close. We all had a great time!!

<Content>Just Fine for a Night or Two We stayed at this hotel for one day/night for a stop over going to St. Martin. Coming from Las Vegas it is a LONG day flying to the Caribbean, so we decided to chop up the flight down and stay here before flying out the next morning for a week in St. Martin. For a night or two I would say it is perfect, cost was around $110/nt at the end of April and was about 5 minutes to/from the airport. It is only 1 or 2 blocks from the beach and there were several restaurants/bars right there at the beach that we enjoyed. Rooms are very basic, but with the other hotel rooms going for almost $200/nt for not much better (from what I have read) this place is perfect for a short stay - any longer I would pay more and stay elsewhere.

<Content>Horrible, Horrible Reservations were made by my future sister-inlaw, as our whole family traveled to PR for a family wedding OCT '03. She was never told that hotel was to be under construction. Lobby was constantly drapped in big plastic tarps. Constant flooding occured in lobby at the foot of the stairs After traveling to PR for many hours we were informed that the bar /restaurant would not be open for food or refreshments. Our group of 19 decided to have food and drinks brought in. This bar'restaurant was rarely open in the 5 days we were there. The following day a sign was posted throughout the hotel stating that no food or beverages could be brought in from the outside. Moldy puddles of long standing water surrounded part of the pool area. Terrible part of town, sounds of people being beaten up at night. Furniture throughtout hotel in state of disrepair. Hotel staff never put themselves out to assist with any problems. Ruined what was a long anticipated trip!! SHOULD BE CLOSED DOWN!!!

<Content>Villa del Sol in San Juan - Never Again ! Theese guys spoiled our entire vacation ! We made a reservation with Villa Del Sol 4 months ago. We were supposed to be staying with them during Christmass/New Year time. We also called back twice during theese 4 months to confirm our reservation, and were told that all's fine. 2 days prior to our departure for San Juan we've received a call from a hotel manager stating that they don't have a room for us !!! They gave no appologies, nor did they offered any compensation. The explanation they offered was that we were supposed to be in the room that was under construction, but wasn't finished in time - and they found out about it 2 days before our scheduled departure ?! Needless to say that during Christmass/New Years time in PR all hotels in San Juan area are fully booked, and rooms that are left are going for over $500.00 per night or more. We were forced to stay at the hotel in the south of puerto rico, hours and hours away from any major attraction or decent beach, and we spent most of our precious vacation time driving ! We came back from this vacation aggrevated and even more tired ! We've traveled all over the world, but have never encountered such unprofessionalism and ignorence on the part of any travel service provider. Never again will we even consider this hotel, or even coming back to Puerto Rico for that matter, they took away all that any vacation is about - fun and relaxation. It's ok, we'll find it somewhere else !

<Content>Nightmare from hell!!! Our experience with Hotel Villa del Sol was absolutely a nightmare from hell. The first night we found out that my pillowcase had blood stains. Then our toilet flooded the following day. We did not receive new towels 2 nights in a row...despite many visits to the front desk to ask for towels. Our fourth night the toilet flooded again. We reported it, once again, to the front desk and they just dried the floor and left. No apologies!! No nothing! And of course, our sixth and last night the toilet flooded one more time. But this time with more impetus and got some of our clothes wet. We once again visited the front desk. But since the incident happened after hours we had to wait until someone could come in and clean it. The manager came in and they just cleaned the floor. I demanded a new room!!! The manager gave us a room on the 3rd floor (no elevator!!) and didn't even bother to help us with our luggage or even apologize for the great inconvenience that this caused. Oh! Before I forget, I asked for an extra bed at the front desk and after paying for it, they told they'd bring it in. Two hours later I had not received my extra bed. I went to the front desk and the worker asked me to go and pick it up myself from the storage room. Lastly, they charged a service fee when we checked out, I assume because of the toilet!! Anyway, this may all seem unbelievable, but it's true! Please don't make the mistake of staying at this hotel. For $92 a night you could find something better. Don't do it!!!!
