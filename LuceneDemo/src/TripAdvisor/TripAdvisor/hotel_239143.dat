<Content>terrible service I booked the hotel for one night durig a buissness stay. When I wanted to chck in, I could neither pay by credit card nor by my bank card due to a technical problem of the hotel's machine. When I asked to pay cash next morning, the receptionist refused and made me go to a ATM although it was raining. That sucks.Morovere, the room was in front of the hotel terrace, so there were people directely in front of my room all the time.Finally, next morning, I was called in my room by the receptionist. He told me I should leave immedeately because it was check out time. Very rude!

<Content>Worst stay ever! We booked quite late but having read the reviews on this website we were pleased to be able to get a reservation. It was my fiancee's birthday weekend and this sounded like an ideal place to stay. However, on arrival we were allocated a room right opposite the reception. We could hear everything going on there despite the receptionist's promise that that wouldn't be the case. Every few minutes the front doorbell would ring and then the ensuing conversation in reception could be clearly heard. Of course we complained and reqested a change of room. This request was refused and we were given the option of finding an alternative hotel yet still having to pay the bill. We did in fact try this as I wanted to rescue what was supposed to be a romantic weekend break. Amsterdam does get pretty well booked up so we resigned ourselves to staying a night in the Bridge Hotel. By this time another receptionist had started their shift and also refused to change our room and gave a different answer as to the whereabouts of the manager. This receptionist rudely told us to go away.In the morning, a third receptionist was on duty and gave a third differing story as to the whereabouts of the hotel manager. We never did find out where the manager was. However, we were now given the option of changing rooms - two options were given - both rooms had been empty the night before and the receptionist could not understand why we were not offered these rooms on our arrival. The new room was better but you could still hear the breakfast staff getting everything prepared in the morning.Service therefore gets zero out of 10.The location is not too bad - only a little further from the main attractions than we had imagined but that's probably a good thing as some of the streets can be very noisy.Breakfast was good (but had to request a new tray of meat and cheese to be brought out) but bread rolls and croissants would have been a nice addition. We will not be staying here again. We didn't even get a goodbye on our departure.

<Content>A wonderful hotel! We stayed for three nights at this very comfortable and well located hotel. The staff were welcoming and accommodating - not that we needed any assistance from them. I requested a modern room over looking the Amstel river which was spacious and clean and the view was really beautiful. The breakfast was fine, plenty of cereal, fruit and bread to choose from, however if you're after a full cooked breakfast (which we weren't) I'd look elsewhere. It took about 20 mins to walk to the centre, Dam Square, and 5 mins by tram, so it's location is ideal - especially if you're looking for a quieter hotel, away from the hustle and bustle... but yet... not too far!

<Content>Great location and views We stayed there for 3 nights. The room was very spacious. We booked one of the rooms with Amstel view. Therefore great views especially at night time. I can comment on the cheaper rooms to the back. The rooms were very clean, but equipped very basic. All looks like coming from IKEA - and it prob does. In relation to overall prices and standards in Amsterdam, it is good value for money. I don't think it is easy to find such big rooms so close to the city centre.

<Content>Clean, refreshing hotels with persona touch and easy access If you are in Amsterdam for a few days and appreciate a personal touch to your hotel stay then you should try and get a few nights here. This is a clean compact and very well decorated hotel. My room was quite large -spotlessly clean - and with a large bathroom. My favorite point was the decor. It doesn't make or break the stay but having a room with refreshing design makes it stand out from the other chain hotels that are the same the world over. Bathroom was large with big walking shower. Impeccably designed and maintained.Room view was not much but who cares it was very bright and airy due to big opening windows. Bed was very comfy.Large steel, dressing room style locker may not be to everyones taste but was useful and secure for storing baggage (bring a lock) and added to the decor.Breakfast is usual buffet style, but of top notch quality. Bread, meats, cheeses, jams, all of v high quality. Staff welcoming and always with a smile even at 4 in the morning.Cost of room is well worth it, plus you are in walking distance of trams and metro and with an effort you can walk right into centre.One negative point to watch out for (not 100% due to hotel) was the taxi ordered for a trip to airport. I asked specifically for taxi who took credit card. They don't order a taxi, more a limo service, which can cost up to 60 euro and they (taxi people) make a REALLY big deal over paying with credit card...was pretty stressful at 4 in the morning.

<Content>excellent hotel . great views of the river. very clean we have just had two nights at the bridge hotel.after searching on the internet and reading reviews, we decided to book the hotel. the occassion was for my sisters 40th birthday.we were a group of 10 px, we had three amstel view rooms and two on the first floor(212,211) and we all where not dissapointed.the hotel is ideally situated for peace and quite at night, but also near enough to walk into the many bar areas.the breakfast room was very clean and more than enough to eat.the bedrooms are very clean and modern and have an excellent shower cubicle.the staff are very helpful and let us leave our cases in reception on our departure day .we got a train from the airport , then a tram to the hotel. very good transport system.we had two great nights out in the city, plenty for everyones taste!!!!. also plenty of places to eat .will definately be back to amsterdam, and certainly will stay at the bridge hotel again.

<Content>Good value for your money in Amsterdam terms The rooms are simple, the location is quite central (when we stayed, the queen had her birthday party literally next door, in the Carr茅 theatre), the breakfast was okay and the staff was very friendly. We read that others had had trouble with noise due to thin walls but we didn't experience any of it. We would be happy to go back.

<Content>Okay, but noisy Good location, rooms OK, but the walls are so thin that it is almost possible to follow a conversation in the room next door.In a city with many tourists enjoying the nightlife and coming back very late, it can be unpleasant.

<Content>Like living in the dorms This hotel was recommended to me for its rooms offering charming views of the Amstel river. I stayed for one week at the Bridge Hotel and had a room with a view for 2 nights, but this did not make up for the overall experience. The hotel reminds me of the dorm in which I spent my junior year abroad in Europe. The decor is very worn, the floors are dirty and the bathroom utilitarian at best. But, mostly, the staff acts as though they are housesitting, or filling in for someone else. Once, I rang the front bell to be let in (it was below freezing outside) and waited more than 10 minutes while the person who managed the front desk was fixing a plumbing problem. There are simply no staff around. On another day when I returned in the evening to my room and realized that the cleaning staff had not provided any soap, the front desk could not offer any solutions. When I asked for hotel services, I was told that the office equipment like copy machine was broken. I had to walk to a copy place. Finally, when asked to switch my room with a view to another one, I was told to check out all my things at 11 a.m., put my suitcases behind the front desk, and wait until 3 p.m. before I could have my new room (I wasn't leaving the hotel, merely switching rooms). I was insulted since my stay was a week long, and I protested; it took over an hour to convince the only staff member that this procedure was unacceptable. There is simply no professional person working there, much like my college dorm experience. This is a bare-bones place. The view is nice. The location is fine. I am ranking one notch above terrible because the location was close to metro and trolleys.

<Content>Great for the price The location is pretty good; central to a lot of different things that are walking distance, close to a lot of tram spots and quiet. The rooms were really clean and beds comfy. I appreciated the large bathrooms. Breakfast was great and convenient to start the day. For more of a scene i would tell people to stay somwhere in the Jordaan, but for the $$, value and cleanliness, I would stay here again.

<Content>great balcony and view Great room, very comfortable bed, excellent breakfast (fresh salami, mozzarella, fruit, breads, cereal, eggs). They will hold your luggage if you arrive too early to check in which is a huge bonus. Great balcony - there were fireworks outside of our room the night we stayed which was really neat. Hard to find the first time so I suggest taking a cab from the airport or train station.

<Content>Perfect Mid-Range The Bridge Hotel was completely what I was looking for: clean, wonderful location, some amenities (shower in room, TV, breakfast), good price. It's in a lovely, laid-back part of town. My room was plain but very clean, and overlooked the Amstel River (so was a bit chilly in grey October). The staff was generally helpful and quite friendly. The only negative was some sort of party or concert was going on VERY nearby on my first night (maybe at the Theater Carre, which is next door), and so it was pretty noisy up until around 1:30 a.m. The rest of my 3-night stay was perfectly silent, though, so it may have been the exception rather than the norm. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Great Place to Stay in Amsterdam The Bridge Hotel is a great place to stay in Amsterdam. Quiet location, yet close to underground and trams. The decor of the room is not my style, as it is modern with chrome, black and white, and lockers that would not fit my luggage, but the room is large and comfortable. The walk-in shower is large and modern. No shower curtain; the water runs into a drain, which I had to get used to. With the very ample breakfast, The Bridge was quite affordable for Amsterdam. The staff at the front desk helped us find our way around town and were very nice. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Our home in Amsterdam We LOVED The Bridge Hotel, and stayed there a total of eleven nights. We booked rather late, thinking that at this time of year there would be no trouble getting a room. Oops! The first part of our stay was for eight nights, and because they were so booked, we needed to change rooms three times, so we had quite a tour of the place. Our first room was really lovely, with a very modern bath and a balcony overlooking the Amstel River. The second room was quite small, with two small skylights but no windows. Very adequate, but we had been spoiled by the first room. The third room was in an older section of the hotel, not as modern, but comfortable none the less. Then we went to Begium for a week, and returned to Amsterdam for the last three days of our visit to the Netherlands. We had another great room, much like the first one, but with a huge private terrace. All rooms were spotlessly clean. The breakfast buffet, included in the room rate, was outstanding. And the reception staff was absolutely terrific: they were helpful, accomodating, friendly, and very welcoming.The location of the hotel is also ideal. The views along the Amstel River are amazing, and the hotel is a short block from the picturesque Magere Bridge. It is only a 5-7 minute walk across that bridge to lots of great restaurants along the Utrecht Straat or in nearby Rembrandt Square. It's two blocks to the Metro, five minutes walking to the Opera House and to the Hermitage Museum, and right next door to the Carre Theatre. We would absolutely stay there again (and again), and will enthusiastically recommend this hotel to our friends.

<Content>a great home away from home! I have just returned from a stay of 5 nights at the Bridge Hotel. The location was fantastic. I walked from there to all the major sights of Amsterdam. The people who work at the hotel were so helpful and positive. The room ( a double/twin) was a decent size with wood floors  pine furniture which added to its warmth. The bathroom was ample with a good shower. The entire hotel is kept very clean. The breakfast offered a variety of breads, cheeses, meat, cereals and was nicely arranged. There is a lounge with a computer for the use of the guests, with newspapers and books to read, where you can purchase hot and cold beverages.A 5 minute walk over the Skinny Bridge and you are on Ultrechstraat, with a variety of restaurants and shops. The metro and/or tram stops are all within a 5-8 minute walk. The hotel looks onto the Amstel River and some rooms have a view. My room was at the back of the hotel where it was very quiet.I would highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Nice and Quiet Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in September. The location of the hotel is about a 10 minute tram ride from Centraal Station, then about a 3 minute walk from the tram stop. The hotel is located on the Amstel River away from a lot of the hustle and bustle of other parts of Amsterdam. Our room was quite large with minimalistic furntiure, clean and cozy. There was a large shower, but no bath tub. The staff could have been a little nicer. Breakfast was typical contental style. Overall we thought this hotel was nice and we were happy with our experience. We would recommend this property again.

<Content>Great location Having just reread the reviews on this hotel I feel like I stayed at a different hotel! We were in the new wing with a lovely, big , bright room and a bathroom with a huge shower. There were lots of shampoo/conditioner/bath gel in a basket. We even had a little view of the canal from our windows. The staff were friendly and very helpful. It is located right on a canal in a peaceful  quiet area that is within walking distance of almost everthing. If you want to be in the middle of all the tourist areas and the action, this is not. If you want a peaceful and quiet sleep after seeing everything, this is a good place to do it. Breakfast, which included more than most, is included and is served until 10:30 for those who don't get up early.

<Content>not for me! I'd have to echo the sentiments of the New Yorker. I just checked out this morning after a stay here and left similarly unimpressed! Nothing specifically wrong with it but nothing particularly right about it either. The location is nice, for sure, but it is a good walk to some of the main areas. The room itself was without doubt one of the most depressing places I've ever spent time. Fine if you don't want to spend any time in it but i needed to. Everything felt a bit cheap, a bit dated and just a bit below standard for the rate being charged. Breakfast was ok,nothing to write home about though and other food and drink facilities were very limited (vending machine and drinks from the lounge). I have stayed in a few other Amsterdam hotels so I know whats out there, but this place kind of ruined my trip this time. As said no real facilities so if you're expecting a bit of luxury, this is not the place. In Bratislava now and what I have got for the same money puts The Bridge Hotel into context for me. The level of service, facilities and accommodation was poor at The Bridge and I couldnt see myself ever going back. Sorry!

<Content>Rooms are questionable! One of the first things we did when we returned to New York was to look at the reviews again for this hotel on Trip Advisor to see if we missed anything. Because having read glowing reviews and ratings of 4-5 we were really surprised at what we found.Granted, the location is excellent, the rooms are large for European standards, the breakfast is fine and included in the price and the staff is helpful and friendly......we found the rooms to be very COLD...and not very comfortable at all! Yes, they had good heating but they were just very, very low budget with linoleum floors, old style drop ceilings, no amenties to speak of, thread bare towels, a couple of tubes of shampoo and shower jel and that's basically it....oh, and fake potted plants!The rooms (we had two different ones) are clean but stark! They try to go the modern, minimalist look but the exposed bulbs in the drop ceilings, the faux steel, cheap black tables, metal lockers, etc. made my dorm room in college seem like a spa!Really, not to bad mouth the hotel because they probably do try very hard but the rooms are simply no better than Days Inn or Motel 66 in the USA...but without even carpeting. Plus the shower stall was incredibly small even for my wife who is fairly small and I the sink is just tiny! The lighting in the rooms were horrible and while the walls are newly painted it appeared...they were as thin as could be!Having traveled for business and pleasure to over 60 countries in the past 25 years, I've become pretty tolerant to hotels and basically consider them places to sleep at night but at 160 euros, or app $225 per night, one should and could do better.We had friends staying at the Eden Rembrandt a few blocks away at Rembrandt Square...a bit more hectic location but the room was $35 less (no breakfast), a smaller more typical size room for Europe but OH SO MUCH COMFORTABLE, great bathroom, great towels, linens, toiletries, lamps, muted colors, quiet, better EVERYTHING basically. We expected the opposite to be true when we chose a smaller hotel just a few blocks away from the crowds but were simply disappointed with The Bridge. They could at least put down a couple of area rugs in the room and add light fixtures, not naked bulbs that someone thinks is really cool.....cause its not!But if you like large rooms and breakfast included in the price The Bridge may be for you...but if you like at least a small bit of luxury, comfort, warmth and convenience for your $225 than we would definitely not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Pleasant quiet hotel Our stay at The Bridge Hotel was very pleasant. The location is very convenient and peaceful. The breakfast was fresh and ample to give one a good start to the day. We also found all of the staff to be friendly and helpful. Our room seemed good size by European standards, the bed comfortable, and a nice view of a side canal. Would stay here again.

<Content>Take me to the Bridge. August 10th,Just back from 3 days in Amsterdam,stayed at this lovely Hotel, very clean and a great location.Room was huge,6m by 7m(room 101) had a view out of room right onto the Amstel canal and we could see the magere bridge. First class location easy walking distance to alllocations,plenty pubs/restuarants within 5 mins,in fact a pub is below hotel and one at the magere bridge. Quiet location ,good breakfast choice. Directions/advice from woman on reception to use metro 54 from Weesperplien(just a block away) to Duivendrecht station and we got the train from there to Schipol airport much easier than using Centraal station as this is quite manic. Well impressed and if in Amsterdam again will definitely stay here.

<Content>Location, Location, Location Just come back from a 3 night stay at the Bridge and it was excellent.We went with another couple and were allocated Rooms 120 and 121 which were on the bottom floor but were in a little annexe all of their own so it was just the 2 of us with no noise from other rooms. The rooms themselves were large and very clean with lovely views over the canal. The breakfast was the normal cold selection but it was plentiful and nice, we spent ages trying to boil the perfect egg as the water wasn't quite boiling you you couldn't use the normal length of time !The staff were a mixed bag, some very friendly but one particular woman seemed to think it a complete imposition if you asked her a question as she was busy on the internet.The best part though is the location, we never used the Tram as we could walk everywhere. The hotel is in a lovely quiet area so you don't feel intimidated walking around at night and it was only 5 minutes from Remrandt Square and 20 minutes from the red light district. The furthest we walked was about 40 minutes to Anne Frank but this was a really pleasant walk so it didn't feel that long. Really recommend booking Anne Frank on-line as it means you go straight in rather than queuing behind the hundreds of people and the Rancho Restaurant of Rembrandt Square was excellent as they did a tourist menu of Steak (beautiful) chips and salad for 10 Euros.

<Content>Great choice We loved The Bridge Hotel. As it's aptly named, it's located one block away from Magere Bridge. Its location is very convenient - it's close to all major attractions. One time we timed how long it would take us to walk to the Central station (didn't want to wait for the tram) - the result was 25 minutes of brisk walk. The room was clean, the bathroom was spacious, and the breakfast was excellent. I would definitely come back to this hotel when I make it back to the beautiful Amsterdam.

<Content>Good Location Good Location by the Amstel canal, clean and tastefully decorated rooms, ok breakfast (could have been better). 10 min walk to the city center. Recommend to take the Metro from the Central station to Weesperplein, takes about 5-6 min. Costs 鈧?,60. Then its just a 5 min walk to the hotell. Taxi from the Central station to the hotels costs 鈧?6....and takes about 15 minutes in rush hour.

<Content>Great boutique hotel! We stayed at the Bridge Hotel for 2 nights in April 2007. We had two rooms, 1 triple on the ground floor, and 1 double on the 2nd floor. The rooms were very different in terms of decor; the double room was very modernly furnished, in an Ikea sort or way (stainless steel furniture and flat-screen TV) and the triple room was more traditional (wood furniture and no flat screen TV). The bathrooms in both were great!The only challenge was that there was no elevator and the staircases are narrow, steep and spiral, making it difficult to transport larger and heavier suitcases. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast was good, although, I don't know if we would have paid for it if it was not included. The location was central, along the canal. Very close to the Kalverstraat shopping area, the flower market, flea market, etc.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Have just returned from a very pleasant stay at the Bridge Hotel (4 nights) Attractive room, plenty of space, very clean, nice toiletries. Breakfasts were very good, plenty of choice, clean  airy room. Staff were very helpful. Exactly as described in their website. Nice and close to everything, only a short walk by the river to get to everything. Nice part of the city to be in. Would definately recommend!

<Content>A Good Experience and Impression My husband and I enjoyed staying here. The staff was very friendly and accomodating, the room clean, and the breakfast generous. We paid more than what we normally do per night but considering the location, cleanliness, neighbourhood, and how secure we felt, it was worth it. The location is fantastic - very quiet at night and within a short walking distance to subway, tramline, restaurants, bridges, and shopping. The only negatives I can think of are that the furnishings were a bit old fashioned in our room but the bed was surprisingly comfortable and this is the first hotel I've ever stayed in that the curtains were not lined which was a concern in case the sun came shining through waking us up but it wasn't that big of an issue in the end. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>A fab hotel My mother and I just returned from a stay at the bridge - it was lovely. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and not too small. We loved the breakfast that comes with the price of a room. And the location is good too, away from the throngs of the old centre but walking distance from the southern canal belt with great shops and restaurants. I couldn't recommend it enough!

<Content>loved the bridge hotel Have just come back from staying at this hotel for New Year, we had a wonderful time. Hotel situated just within walking distance of all atractions, in a very quite neighbourhood.Our room was very modern and very clean. The receptionists were very helpful to us, nothing was too much trouble for them, even down to translating a menu for us, which was very helpful, as we can highly recommend the restaurant De Carrekelder, situated next door to the Carre Theatre, just a few hundred yards from the hotel. All in all we had a really good time, and would not hesitate in recommending to any friends and family.Thanking you all for a good time.

<Content>Second time just as great as the first time! I stayed back in Sept. of 2004 and again in Sept. 2006 and it was another wonderful stay at The Bridge. We even got the same room we stayed in last time. The room is huge compared to Europe standards. Perfect place to start your Amsterdam adventure. Bathroom is a good size. The only thing that they can improve on in the bathroom is a shower curtain. The floor got wet when we tooks showers. Other than that I loved the room. It even had a view of the small canel. All of A'dams attractions are a short distance away. A'dam is very small which is why everything is so close. There is even a couple of nice coffee houses blocks away. (if you are in to that) The breakfast is a standard Euro breakfast. Cold cuts, cheeses, hard and soft boiled eggs, toast, cereal, granola, yogurt and juices. More then enough to get your day started right. The cold cuts were my favorite. But with all the night time activities that A'dam as to offer, I didn't make it to breakfast as much as i wished. It is really easy to get to from the train station to the Hotel. You just have to figure out the Metro and your golden. (only one line there. not very hard. i think the third stop.) I have found the place to stay in every time that I am in the wonderful city.

<Content>Maybe my standards are high, but... My husband and I stayed at the Bridge Hotel in Amsterdam for three nights. Some background information: We're from Finland, mid-thirties. We had some problems with our room throughout our stay: they gave us a twin-room instead of the double we had booked. After a battle they gave us a double, but we had to wait overnight. Our bathrooms were crappy, cold (no heating system what so ever!!) and totally out of date. The rooms were furnished in a weird rustic manner, with wall-to-wall carpeting, which always is a minus in our book. Our friends were staying at the same hotel and to us their room seemed like from a different universe!!! Modern, comfortable, nice bathroom..... And we payed the same price!! Definite big plus is the place where the hotel is situated: close to everything.

<Content>comfortable and affordable very nice hotel, in very quiet neighborhood, 10 to 20 minute walking distance from many of Amsterdam's tourist attractions. If you dont want to walk, trams and metro are only a short distance from the hotel. Here's a tip-travel light and use the laundramatte. It's a very short walk from the hotel, accross the bridge, about a block and 1/2 and on the right hand side of the street. Front desk people were very nice, rooms were spacious, clean and big bathroom.Would book it again on my next trip.

<Content>Excellent small hotel and location We stayed here for three nights. Our room was exceptionally large (for Europe) and overlooked a quiet street and the Amstel River. Our room was on the entry level, across from the reception area. This was very convenient and it was still very quiet -- especially in the evening. The location was excellent -- within walking distance to many attractions and convenient to public transportation. The included breakfast had a very nice selection of items. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful thoughout our stay. We enjoyed our stay here very much and highly recommend the hotel.

<Content>Too old for sex and drugs Two fifty yr old housewives looking for a suitable base for a weekends sightseeing and shopping.The Bridge Hotel was ideally located for us,being sufficiently removed from the main tourist areas to ensure peace and quiet,but close enough for us to walk everywhere(unless you are the type wedded to your car.) Very clean and comfortable accommodation.Staff polite and efficient and(like all Amsterdammers)fluent in English.Would recommend to friends and would certainly use again on any future visit.

<Content>One of the best in Dam! We stayed for 4 nights here in september. Our room was big, comfortable, just nearby the canal with a great view and quite far from noise. Their breakfast is rich and delicious, and staff is smiling and helpful. Location is central and beatiful. The prices are reasonable as well. We asked to the girl at the reception desk if she had any idea about that restaurant we wanted to go that night and she gave us good ideas about that place and the other places to be in Amsterdam, even looked at her guidebook to find the addresses and the numbers. You should definetely ask her if you need ideas about the city..It will be our second home in Amsterdam and we will definetely come back !

<Content>A nice hotel We liked this hotel, stayed here for three nights; the rooms are spotless and shower room excellent size. We didn鈥檛 have a telephone in our room not usually a problem but our luggage went missing at Gatwick airport and we did need to make a few calls on our mobile telephone which was quite expensive. We enjoyed the Breakfast; it set you up for the day. We walked into the city centre it was about a 20 鈥?25 minute walk, which is not bad going out but a little tiring returning after a long day site seeing. You can always use the tram or metro though. Overhaul we liked this hotel

<Content>Great View We splurged a little to stay at The Bridge Hotel because we wanted a nice canal/river view while in Amsterdam, and we certainly weren't disappointed in that respect. Moreover, our room was large and clean, and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. The handy free internet room and the good breakfasts were also a plus. The location was good, but I wouldn't say great -- except for the wonderful view of that unique bridge. Mass transit were a 7-8 minute walk away, and, unless you REALLY like to walk, the tram system is a great benefit in Amsterdam We only had one minor problem, and that was that we had room 101, right behind the front desk, and a light sleeper might be awakened by late night arrivals. A little insulation around the door would help a lot. Would we stay there again -- in a heartbeat. Even the minor nightly noises in room 101 were well-compensated by the bridge view.

<Content>If your going to Amsterdam stay here! We picked The Bridge as a result of the reviews on TripAdvisor. Six of us (three couples) stayed for two nights and had a great time. The hotel was excellent quality and value for money. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful. Our room had a lovely view over the river. Advice for travellers to Amsterdam, the best way to get around is to hire a bike. If you can't beat them join them. STAY HERE YOU'LL LOVE IT!

<Content>Great location! I like many others, use Trip Advisor to choose hotels. But I always contact the property directly when making reservations. The Bridge has been one of the nicest places we've stayed in Europe.The staff was very helpful and the location great. We hada lovely room right on a side canal. A canal taxi stop is justa bit from the hotel, those are a fun way to get around. I wouldrecommend this to even my pickest friends!

<Content>Great hotel We booked this hotel as a result of the reviews on this site and we were not dissapointed. The location is great, right on the river and away from the noise of any traffic.The room was suprisingly large, spotlessly clean and comfortable.A good quality continenental breakfast started our days nicely. When we first arrived in Amsterdam we used the trams but, really its an easy city to get around on foot. You must visit the Red light district just to confirm all you've heard is true ! We will definately visit again and the bridge will be our hotel without any doubts.

<Content>A true gem of a hotel! A party of four adults and 2 infants, we stayed in the Gold Apartment of the Bridge Hotel in early April and it more than met our expectations and our needs. The hotel is ideally situated off the beaten track yet within comfortable walking distance of the centre and most of the major attractions. The apartment itself was spacious, clean and well furnished with one large bathroom and another small but adequate toilet/shower unit. Although the kitchen had ample supply of tea and coffee fixings, a very modern stove and high end appliances ( kettle and coffee percolator) as well as fine crockery and cutlery, a most generous buffet breakfast was included in the rate. The staff was friendly and helpful and we did not find the lack of an elevator to be a great drawback. All in all we were very pleased with the accommodation and its location and considered it good value for its cost. We would not hesitate to recommend it and would definitely return there on any future visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>Clean, comfy and cheap (by Amsterdam standards) I stayed at the Bridge Hotel for Easter weekend, on the basis of price (all of the Amsterdam hotels had a 4-night minimum stay, which made our 3-night trip 33% more expensive). We paid 鈧?15 per room per night including a great buffet breakfast. It's a decent hotel, if a bit basic. No fancy stuff like mini bars, hairdryers or coffee makers in the room, and the furniture is a bit plain. On the other hand, everything was spotlessly clean, we had lots of hot water and fluffy towels, and the staff on reception were very helpful and friendly. The location is great - a lovely old street on the Amstel, with a few low key neighbourhood bars and cafes close by. It's within 20 minute's walk of most of the sights, yet quiet and safe enough to get a good night's sleep. Good base for a weekend in Amsterdam so long as you don't expect anything too fancy!

<Content>Loved the Bridge Hotel, Again My extended family and I stayed at the Bridge Hotel just before Easter Weekend. This was our second time there. Stayed there last year and loved it, this year was no different. The owner was coming out of the hotel as we parked and grabbed four of our bags to help us in the front door. Staff care and concern for us was excellent. They are genuinely friendly, called cabs for us, advised us on sites to see and where to eat, phoned for meals to be delivered, and made us feel sincerely welcome. My mother-in-law is a tough customer, and she loved this hotel. The stairs are a challenge, but no more than anywhere else in Amsterdam. We stayed in the studio apartment which I recommend for a family of four. If we return to Amsterdam, this hotel is my first and only choice.

<Content>Great Value on the Amstel river The location of the hotel is great! A quiet location, but easy walking distance (10 minutes) to Rembrandtplein, which seems like club central Amsterdam. Lovely Magere Bruge bridge close by, which is written up in travelguides. Easy 20 minute walk to the Rijkesmuseum, or you can take the trams. We had intended to take the trams to get around town, but found it really wasn't necessary, except to go to Nieuwe Zjid (to visit Anne Frankhuis), which we were able to walk back from in a meandering path. The room was clean and warm, if a bit on the plain side, but the bathroom was spotless, white tiled, and the shower closet is bigger than one I had used in hong kong, and more comfortable than one I had in New York. The bed and bedding are comfortable and very warm. I love the cleanliness of duvet covers. :) We had room 103, which is adjacent to the reception area, so it was a bit noisy when the late night foot traffic was going by. But we weren't detered because it was close to the best candy jar in town at the reception desk.The staff was very helpful with directions, and getting around. Internet/computer use is so cheap! 2 Euro per use, with no time limits. The breakfast buffet (included with stay) is awesome. Three cheeses, selection of meats, selection of breads, make your own boiled eggs, cereal, juice, coffee, milk, and little sweets to go, as well as a selection of spreads.We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to anyone, especially considering the reasonable price.Would stay here again!!

<Content>Good value, good location We stayed at The Bridge Hotel during a cold and snowy few days, but the room was warm and cosy, and we had a great canalside view, even without the need to upgrade. Breakfast was the norm for such accomodation and was good, and overall The Bridge was great value for money in an accessible (if you don't like walking, then Amsterdam may not be the best location for you in the first place!) but quiet location. Soap in the bathroom would have been nice though! Definitely the best hotel we have stayed in in Amsterdam over several visits.

<Content>Ripped off!!!! I didn't stop here but had booked a room for a nice romantic week with my wife, but due to other commitments I decided I needed to stop a little closer to Dam square so I cancelled the room within plenty of time and didn't look back until I checked my credit card account and they took the first nights payment, so I emailed them explaining their mistake to which they admitted it was their fault and they'd refund the money, well 3 weeks later I'm still waiting and I've now instructed my cc provider to claim the money back off them!

<Content>TripAdvisor is spot on re: thishotel Stayed at the Bridge Hotel Feb. 12-13, 2006If you read all the reviews posted here, you'll get a good picture of this hotel.It's not fancy, but it's a great value. The location is only 1/2 block from the best hotel in Amsterdam (The Amstel Intercontinental) with easy access to trams.Be advised, no cab driver in Amsterdam has ever heard of this hotel. But, if you say it's two doors down from Theatre Carre, everyone knows exactly where it is.The stairs are challenging, especially to the third floor. Not for the frail or heavy packers. No porter, no elevator. Breakfast may be a bit European for some Americans. Boil your own egg, cold meats, cereal etc. but fine for us. We found the staff most helpful and kind. All in all a great value! If you don't mind walking 10 minutes to restaurants, the location is superb. A new landscaping project along the Amstel will soon make this location even better. Think of it as a great BB and you will not be dissapointed.Feel free to email us with any questions.

<Content>Great place to stay We stayed in the Bridge Hotel from February 9 to 12th and had a great time. The room was nice and spacious and had a great view. Breakfast was good and the staff was extremely helpful. They recommended a Dutch restaurant and even got us a reservation for 14 people on the same evening. In walking distance to the hotel are some tram lines and a stop for the canal boat. The only thing that was a little disappointing was that our bathroom did not have a heater and it was very cold during our trip. I would definitely stay at The Bridge Hotel again.

<Content>Not so good We were in The Bridge Hotel from 26 to 28 december. We expected a very good hotel, because of other reviews. We were a bit disappointed.The location is good (near Magere Brug), and the room is wide enough but... The view from the bedroom's windows was nothing special, also because we were at the ground floor. I asked the reception to move to another floor but they told it was not possible. Outside was very cold and the room wasn't warm enough and, most of all, the bathroom was absolutely frozen, because there was no heating. Is it possible to have a frozen bathroom in a three-star hotel?The staff wasn't so friendly: we asked for a suggestion for the first dinner and the girl at the reception didn't know what to say, she just gave us a list of restaurants without any explanation.The breakfast was nothing particular and neither various.Sorry, but it's not a good address.Giacomo

<Content>the best 3 star hotel money can buy Firstly I was apprehensive of staying in this hotel because it had had so many good reviews, so there is always the possibility of dissapointment, however,I organised a works xmas do for 18 people all to stay at the Bridge from 16-18th December, I was impressed with the hotel as soon as we approached the entrance, it was clean and smart and quite fancy, we were all recieved with a very warm reception.The decor of the hotel was lovely and modern throughout with quirky little extras, in the bar there is an old original coca cola machine, and full selection of games, in the hallway close to our room was a vending machine full of chocolate crisps and nuts and cigarettes, very handy.No one in our party had any problems with their rooms and everyone commented on how spacious they wereMy double room was lovely and spacious, tastefully decorated, the bathroom was also large with a modern white bathroom suite, lit mirror and complimentary soap and shampoo the room also had a lovely view of the amstel.The Breakfast room was lovely and modern and the selection of breakfast food was excellent. All in all a great hotel, would def go back.

<Content>A Neat Surprise We arrived at the Bridge Hotel on a cold rainy April morning after a long flight. The desk clerk, Nancy, let us check in early to be able to sleep for awhile, before we started exploring the city. The room was modest but clean and could find no problems with it. We had asked for a room on the first floor, when reservations were made, and our request was granted. The buffet breakfast was especially nice. Nancy had sent us directions on how to get to the hotel by tram. Great experience, and the tram is what we used to get around Amsterdam. The staff was helpful regarding our questions as to the day trips by train in which we were interested. Very easy to do. There are no major restaurants in the area, but found a little one close to the hotel that had good food, with staff kind enough to translate the menu for us. The area around the hotel is unigue and yes, we would gladly stay there again. The Bridge Hotel is one of those reviewed by Frommers, which is a great help in choosing accomodations.

<Content>Great service I had to take a moment to write about the service at the Bridge Hotel.I was supposed to stay at this hotel but did not because of a travel agent mistake. When I arrived, I found that my agent had really blown it.The staff at the Bridge went way out of their way to help us out and find a room for us for the weekend in a sold out city. They didn't have to help us but made my fiance and I feel very welcome while spending about an hour helping us locate a room.Nancy and the the other women were great and we would go back to stay with them just based on their kindness.

<Content>Can't wait to return My wife and I recently spent 5 nights at the Bridge Hotel. We did our research and therefore were not expecting a five star hotel. The Bridge hotel is well located withing walking distance of most sights. Our room was clean and modestly furnished. The breakfast was more than substantial. The staff were extremely nice and helpful, especially when my wife and I made a trip to the local er. Don't stay at this hotel if you're looking for luxury. If you're looking for a clean, centrally located hotel with a great staff the Bridge hotel is the spot. Just up the road located at waterlooplein is a great little pub Blausberg(spelling may be off) eat cafe. Tell Karen and Carl their American friends from Florida say hello.

<Content>Would highly recommend The Bridge Hotel What made our stay in The Bridge Hotel so enjoyable was the friendly, helpful staff. We arrived mid morning and expected to have to leave our bags and return later to check into our room. Instead we were told to wait just a few mins as our room was almost ready. The receptionist made us a cup of coffee whilst we waited ! As it was our first trip to Amsterdam, we had a number of queries re directions etc. All members of staff that we asked were more than helpful and went out of their way to go the extra mile to assist.Well location. Will recommend The Bridge Hotel to our friends .

<Content>Disappointing; can definitely get more for your money... We stayed in this 'hotel' for 4 days. The first double room we were given was bare-bones at best, with no carpeting, two single bed sets of sheets on a double bed, thin scratchy washcloths for towels, no hand soap in the bathroom and a musty smell throughout. We requested a different room hoping for better conditions but were disappointed to find the second room had the same qualities as the first with the exception of office-floor carpeting and this time the bathroom lacked a shower curtain as well! The hotel staff was not helpful and seemed bothered by any questions - we asked about transportation and making local phone calls from our room and were met with hostile attitudes and curt answers. The night desk attendant was even worse than the day staff. When we asked about checking out he said he had no hotel information and was only there to 'keep watch'. Breakfast was typical Dutch and included coffee and toast and occassionally hard boiled (only) eggs and lunch meat, but on 3 of 4 mornings the food was not replenished after it ran out. At 109 euros a night you can find much better accomodations in the same nice area and have a more enjoyable stay in Amsterdam. Beware mosquitoes and spiders.

<Content>Unique Hotel There were 9 of us total that stayed in this hotel and we had the Skinny Bride Studio, a triple and a double. The double was small, like a closet and had no view and barely a bathroom to speak of. The triple was roomy and had a nice view of the Amstel, the bathroom was huge, but oddly enough, there was no shower curtain, which made for wet floors for my friends. The Skinny Bride was worth the walk up 82 stairs (from the first step outside to very top). Warning: the stairs are narrow, steep and at one point, a curve comes out of nowhere. Good exercise, I guess. Studio was spacious and had a mini-kitchenette with fridge, sink  utensils; no stove or oven. Beds were comfy and I was tempted to take a comforter if it would have only fit in my suitcase! :) Front desk staff was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was yummy as well- you could make your own hard boiled eggs! Location was good- the number 9 tram was a 5 minute walk to hop on... in another 5 minutes you could get off and be at the Red Light District. Museums were a breeze on the tram as well. But enjoy the walk if you can! Everything is nearby! I agree with previous post that Indonesian restaurant was quite tasty.

<Content>Genuine Hospitality Everything about this hotel exceeds expectations--from the careful upkeep by conscientious owners through the excellent breakfast served by friendly kitchen help to the most gracious receptionist we have ever encountered (Tjalda). So delightful was our experience that we shall return to Amsterdam partly for the pleasure of staying at this hotel.

<Content>Enjoyable stay! We stayed at the Bridge Hotel for 5 nights last October. It is a nice, clean hotel with very friendly and helpful staff at reception. For the first two nights we stayed in a room without a canal view on the ground floor however they asked us would we mind moving for the rest of our stay as they were doing some building works outside the first room. They upgraded us due to this inconvenience at no extra cost. We found both rooms spacious, clean and comfortable. One small complaint was that if you wanted a fresh breakfast you had to be up very early. When they say last breakfast is at 9.30am they mean they are closing the dining room at that time! We would recommend this hotel to friends looking for a nice, relatively cheap, place to stay.........and for the complimentary sweets at reception!!

<Content>Nice, Clean Hotel The Bridge Hotel was a nice, clean hotel that provided us with the accomodation that we needed. It was a bit loud and not a very big room, but overall- we enjoyed our stay. It was a bit of a walk to the city center, but the area was quieter than other areas of Amsterdam and we felt safe walking back to the hotel at night. The breakfast was quite nice and I would reccomend the Indonesian restaurant next door.

<Content>A Great Place We looked for a place to stay on our way out on a cruise. We were looking for something unique and definately found it at the Bridge Hotel. Had a room overlooking the canal with balcony and great view. Good breakfast included. Only draw back was no elevator but the would recommend this to anyone. If ever had a chance to visit Amsterdam again would stay at the Bridge Hotel

<Content>Got to like the Bridge Just got back from staying 3 nights at the Bridge hotel. The location is the best thing about the hotel. The hotel is a 2 or 3 star but is kept very clean. The breakfast is very good. But what makes it a good place is the staff--very helpful and friendly. Watch out though if you cant climb stairs--the upper floors are up a very steep stairway! Would stay there again

<Content>A great hotel ....... We stayed at The Bridge Hotel mid April for a weekend. It is a lovely hotel - very clean, simply furnished and great value for money. The staff were friendly and even remembered your room number without being prompted! The breakfast is buffet style - breads, ham, cheese, cereals, fruit etc and there is plenty of it so you won't go hungry. We stayed in a deluxe room with an Amstel view which is well worth the upgrade - it was spacious and had great views.The hotel is in a really nice area of Amsterdam, right near to the Skinny Bridge so it's very peaceful compared with staying anywhere near Dam Square! The tram stop is a pleasant 5 minute walk away and the trams are frequent. There are lots of great restaurants a 5-10 minute walk away just over the Skinny Bridge and the Indonesian restaurant next door is highly recommended!!

<Content>Bridge Hotel a big hit with us Just returned for a stay at The Bridge Hotel along with 5 members of my family. We stayed in the 4th floor Skinny Bridge Studio apartment (4) and a small room on the first floor (2). Wanted an affordable place to sleep as well as a spacious place for kids to hang out. Got everything we expected or wanted and more. Price was the best I could find relative to our needs. Hotel was neat and clean everywhere. My wife is a stickler for this and it passed all her expectations for spic'n'span. Location is a 10E cab ride from central station. Easy to walk from this hotel to most places you care to visit. The hotel has two larger apartments we looked at, just to compare the studio apartment to them, but we liked the studio apartment overlooking the Skinny Bridge. Website of hotel did not make claims it could not back up. Only possible negative was the steep stairs, but this is Amsterdam after all, and not relavant to my kids or my physical condition. But the best of all was the staff. . cheerful, helpful, informed, just the kind of people we could trust. We have visited Amsterdam before and will again. I cannot see staying any other place than the Bridge Hotel unless it is booked already.

<Content>Nice people, clean adequate accommodations Prior to a river cruise at the end of March, 2oo5, we booked 1 night at the Bridge and 3 nights at the end of the cruise. It's convenient by tram 9 from Central Station, just get off at Waterloopin and walk next to the river Amstel for about 600 meters. It's an ok walk with not a lot of luggage--we had a backpack and a suitcase that is on rollers that fits in the overhead of an a/c each.Everything is up or down--there's no elevator and our room was on the ground floor. The rooms are neat and clean and the included breakfast buffet is very good. All the personnel are nice and helpful. I especially found Noonja in the breakfast area and Nancy at the front desk to be helpful as she helped me find an attraction I didn't think I'd need--a doctor. My bike threw me and I had to have several stitches. She was efficient and helpful and within 2 hours of the incident I had seen a doctor and was ready to painfully continue my sightseeing. The room rates for this hotel are extremely reasonable and I would not hesitate to stay here again. It's close to Rembrantplein and loads of shopping and restaurants as well as the floating flower market; however, everything is extremely accessible by tram. Fred and Selma, Punta Gorda, FL

<Content>a wonderful hotel I have stayed at this hotel on three seperate occasions. It is a very clean and freindly establishment. Our last visit was in march 2005. We have stayed in amstel view rooms and canal view rooms and in the skinny bridge apartment. All are comfortable and have a great view. The cleaning staff don't bother you early like some hotels and breakfast is always good.Plenty of coffee in a big pot with lots of other items. Anyone who has experienced a european breakfast will appreciate this. The staff is very friendly and they remember you. It is kinda like visiting friends. Location is excellent, a short walk to the metro and good proximity to a grocery store. You really can't go wrong here.

<Content>Great Place For the Money I stayed here in July 2004. I was looking for a clean, safe place to sleep at the end of a long day of walking/biking around Amsterdam. This place met my expectations. The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was great. The bathrooms were a bit bizzare (no shower curtain), but they were clean and functional. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants quality, but doesn't want to pay for a fancy hotel. The location is convenient to everything by bike.

<Content>Brilliant Bridge hotel We stayed at the Bridge hotel in September 2004 for two nights. We booked a triple room and the skinny bridge appartment (4 beds). Both were extremely clean and well furnished but the skinny bridge appartment was superb. It was huge with well equipt kitchenette, table and chairs, comfy clean beds etc. The bathroom was huge with separate toilet. The staff were extremely helpful and arranged us a people carrier taxi for our return journey to the airport that worked out cheaper than trams and taxi's. The breakfast went down a treat with our party. A good assortment of cereal, breads, fruit etc. The hotel is in a pleasant, quiet area but easily walkable to the centre.No complaints from us, we had a ball and would recommend this hotel to anyone. Quality at budget prices!!

<Content>Nice hotel but a few glitches I just returned from amsterdam with four other people had a great time in the city. The hotel was very clean, interesting breakfast, and great location. The only problem we fell into was the night porter who chose to remain nameless even after we asked for his first name. He was not attentive to the people staying in the hotel he refused to awnser the phone or the door so we stood outside for over 20 minutes and at the end of the night he then went on to comment on how stupid americans are. The hotel is right on the canal so its really beautiful the five of us had the rooms in what they called the dungen which was right next to the breakfast room but there are only sky lights and room number 12 did stink of smoke over all it was a pretty nice hotel very comfy beds and great showers just beware of the night porter.

<Content>Quiet, comfortable, great for walkers We found The Bridge Hotel on TripAdvisor and decided to stay there based on the good reviews. We found the staff to be exceedingly gracious and helpful, the rooms simple, clean, and quiet, and the breakfast offered a good selection of choices, including cold cereal, hard and soft- boiled eggs, ham, cheese, toast, orange juice, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate by request. Our room had two wood frame single beds with nightstands and lamps beside them, a desk, and a clothes cupboard. The carpet seemed to be indoor-outdoor type, rugged rather than luxurious. The bathroom had a stall shower, sink, and toilet with bath and hand towels provided.Located beside the Amstel River less than two blocks from the Skinny Bridge (Magere Bruge), we were happy to be away from the noise, hubbub, and neon lights of the downtown train station and Dam areas.We were still within walking distance of major attratctions but if you don't want to walk, the #9 Tram is a couple of blocks away and the Metro just around the corner and up one block. To walk to the Dam or the Rijksmuseum or the Dutch Resistance Museum takes about 15 minutes. We also walked to Anne Frank's house which is somewhat further.Our first stay was from 9/28 - 10/04/04. We enjoyed it so much that we returned at the end of our trip to stay once again the night before we flew home.

<Content>Great views We booked the Amstel Gold appartment at the top of the Bridge Hotel in Amsterdam. It has fabulous views of the Amstel. As an appartment it has everything you could want - comfortable beds and good clean bathrooms, a kitchen equipped with kettle, mugs, tea/coffee, fridge and dishwasher. It is well heated - which we needed as the evenings were drawing in.We found that hiring an appartment rather than the usual hotel bedrooms was much cheaper and somehow a greater level of privacy and yet in the lounge area we could sit and relax with friends.The one disadvantage was that it is at the very top of the building - on the fourth floor. That meant a strenuous climb up quite steep stairs.The hotel is in a good position situated next door to a beautiful theatre. There is an excellent Indonesian restaurant in the basement - very good service and extremely tasty rijstafel. It is a few minutes walk to either Waterlooplein or Weesperplein for the trams or metro.We visited the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum which were as expected - excellent. But the Van Loon museum and the Wilet Holthuysen were unexpected gems to be savoured. We also visited the Cat Boat - interesting for any cat lovers out there. We spent a lot of time and money at the floating flower market as it is just the right time of year for buying tulip bulbs!We ate at the 'Five Flies' but I was disappointed with exceptionally slow service and food that was definitely over priced. The restaurant itself is certainly interesting to visit - but I wouldn't go there to eat again. There are too many other well run, friendly restaurants serving excellent food to go back to that one.All in all, a great few days in a very friendly city but as always when you are abroad, watch out for the handbag snatchers ........... the police were very polite and helpful!

<Content>Nice hotel at a good value I stayed for three nights in August 2004 with my two daughters (age 15 and 11) in Room 324, which was located in the front of the hotel. We had two huge windows that overlooked the picturesque canal. The room was small with three twin beds. The staff was very nice and helpful. The breakfast was average and consisted of cold cuts, cheese, and cereal. There is no lift and dragging our heavy luggage up three flights of narrow, steep stairs was a challenge. We also missed having a hairdryer and A/C. This is a nice hotel at a good value if you don鈥檛 mind doing without these amenities.

<Content>Would definitely stay here again We stayed here from 31st July until 4th August and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is well situated. It's in a quiet area, but easily accessible. We had a triple room which was a good size and very clean. We had a bath with a shower over but no shower curtain!The breakfast was OK. There was plenty and it was a buffet, it just wasn't to our taste. I'm not much of a fan of cold meats at breakfast.The hotel was definitely good value for money in Amsterdam terms.We'll definiteley stay here the next time we're in Amsterdam.

<Content>Excellent hotel at a bargain price! The Bridge Hotel is ideal for travelers looking for a clean, secure hotel at a bargain price! We just returned from Amsterdam and stayed in this hotel for 10 nights. Admittedly a bit apprehensive about a room in Amsterdam after reading so many hotel reviews, we were delighted with our accommodations as well as the service and staff! Our room overlooked (or practically sat on) a side canal and had two large windows that provided an excellent view of the canal and boats passing by. We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the rooms and the linens that were provided--towels were nice and thick (not like some we've experienced in Europe that are thread-bare). Breakfast was more than adequate. Finally, the crowning feature was the excellent service and friendly, knowledgeable staff. In a great location, close to the Skinny Bridge and a Metro stop. Given the service and features of this hotel, what a bargain!
