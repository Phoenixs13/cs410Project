<Content>Terrible Experience!!! We stayed at this hotel for a week and it was a really bad experience. The first thing that makes you never want to enter that place again was an awful smell on the whole floor where our room was located. There were no windows and no ventilation in the corridor so the smell was disgusting. Whenever exiting the elevator (only one of the two was working) we had to hold our noses. Imagine returning from a nice romantic dinner and just before entering your room, having to breath the smell of mould first. No. 2 Unacceptable thing was the BLOCKED bath tub. It took 20 minutes to drain due to being very blocked and while taking a shower we had to step in the blocked water.Moreover, the rooms need renovation! The furniture, the curtains and the floor make the atmosphere too depressive. It is supposed to be a 4 star hotel and they don't even have contemporary mattresses, instead they use simple white sheets that were never changed during our stay, a thin blanket on top and some cheap filthy bed covers! Most of the TV channels were not functioning. The room was on the front side of the hotel and was extremely noisy. We could hear people shouting in the street and ambulances passing by until early morning hours. Coffee at breakfast is awful. We found hair on top of some cookies one morning but nobody from the waiters ever noticed. The Front Office Staff are polite but don't expect to get much of information as a Tourist from them. The Maids are really polite, always smiling. Definitely not a 4 star hotel. The only positive thing is the location as it is central and just accross the Jaume Train Station.

<Content>Not the 4* it claims to be We were booked to stay at another Group Gargallo hotel, The Suizo, just down the road but were moved to the Gotico due to problems with the top floor of the Suizo. The Suizo Hotel is a 3* hotel and we've stayed there before. It is not the best hotel, but as it's a 3*, and having stayed there before, we knew what to expect. We re-booked it because of it's location, and it was clean and very cheap. When we were moved to the Gotico we got quite excited - a 4* hotel and we'd only paid for a 3*, what a result ! From the outside, and even in reception the hotel looked good. We couldn't wait to get up to our room, but we quickly realized it was actually no better than the Suizo Hotel we had originally booked. Our room was very small, a twin room when we had booked a double. The view was of some kind of shaft, no natural daylight at all. The ceiling tiles were falling down in the bathroom and my husband couldn't even stand up properly in the shower, he had to bend right over just to get underneath it, it was that small. The rooms were also very noisy, we could hear everything going on in the room next door from every little cough and sneeze to the toilet flushing and the shower running. The only plus point about this hotel is the location, you cannot beat it. Just a very short walk from the Cathedral, a nice easy stroll from La Ramblas and the beach, and lots of lovely coffee shops, bars and tapas restaurants just along the road. If we had paid the full price of this hotel we would have been very disappointed. We would rather pay for the 3* and know what to expect, than pay more money for this hotel and get the same, if not a lower standard than a 3* This hotel is defiantly not the 4* hotel is claims to be.

<Content>Great location...thats about it! Excellent location 10 minutes walk from the Ramblas in one direction and the port 10 minutes in the other, right in the middle of the beatiful Gothic area which I think is the best part of Barca. Taxi rank a few mins walk in the main sqaure. Lots of little cafes and shops on the street outside. The hotel and rooms are clean and the aircon worked fine but they are about the only positives. The rooms are dark and tiny and most face onto an airshaft which stinks. How it got a 4 star rating I have no idea. This is a 2 or 3 star. However if you get a cheap deal for a few nights and like most people you arent going to be spending any time in the room then go for it!

<Content>Good Location - that is about it. I just recently stayed at this hotel. It was a package deal with our cruise leaving from Barcelona. We could only choose 2 hotels - either the Gotico or a hotel just outside of the city and since I wanted a hotel that was centrally located - I chose the Gotico. I agree with all the other people that have posted on this site for this hotel - NOT a 4 star hotel by any means. 2 stars at the most. I will also agree that the location is wonderful. Close to the metro and in walking distance to many places including Ramblas. The gothic quarter of Barcelona where this hotel is located is a wonderful place to explore. I will also say that the room was clean and the bathroom was the best part of the room but that is about it. The room was so small - in fact it was actually smaller than my room on my cruise ship. The window opened up into a back alley and the a/c was so loud we thought that the actual unit was in the room. They put us right across from the elevators and one was broken on our floor so every time someone buzzed the elevator, the broken one kept opening and closing. We finally got fed up and called the front desk and told them to either fix the elevator or move us to another room - miraculously, the elevator was fixed. There is a breakfast buffet in the morning and most of the European people enjoyed it - there were very few things that we ate - mostly the breads and cheeses. The meats (specifically the pork products) didn't even looked cooked and most of the time, the eggs were already cold. Thankfully we only stayed in this hotel for 2 nights.

<Content>Good Location When we arrived we were given a twin bedded room even though we had booked a double (it was our first holiday away together and this was pretty important to us!!). We complained at reception and were moved to a double room. An hour later, when we were both changing, a member of staff used a key card to unlock our door and walked in on us. He didn't apologise but just turned and walked straight out again. The room was clean, but very dark and the view from the window was of a neighboring wall. We had to get replacement key cards at least ten times during our seven day stay because they weren't working, but the staff never once apologised or offered an explanation. On more than one occasion when we returned to the hotel after a night out there would be a crowd of us waiting outside to be let in by the reception staff, who would eventually appear then walk nonchalantly over and open the doors without a word. When we were going to leave I asked the reception to book us a taxi to the airport for the following day; I checked later on that this had been done. As it turned out it wasn't done and I had to actually YELL at the receptionist before he would pick up the phone and actually order us one. Barcelona was lovely (we're actually returning this year for our honeymoon), but there is no way on earth I'd ever stay here again.

<Content>Ok - small but clean Did not actually book this hotel but was sent here when another hotel gave away our room. The hotel is ok. Our room was small but clean - which was fine as we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. Breakfasts were fine. We mentioned that the lighting in the corridor wasn't working and it was fixed promptly. Location was quite good - in the gothic area, near underground station.

<Content>2 Star at best! The only positive thing about this hotel is it's location which is excellent. The room which was situated at the back of the hotel had a real strong sewerage smell. We had to purchase lots of air refreshners from the local supermarket to compensate for the bad odour. The room was situated over a back yard which seemed to be used for doing the hotel laundry. You could hear the washing machine being used at various times. We found the room very dull and dreary, certainly not somewhere to relax after a hard day's sightseeing. There were no tea/coffee making facilities and the TV had about 5 channels which actually worked.The buffet breakfast was very average with very little choice. They kept running out of breakfast juice, even at 8:00am. I certainly would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It does not merit its 4 Stars.

<Content>A hotel consumed by obvious decay It looks as though this once was a nice modern hotel. But obviously it lacks proper care and maintenance. Most of the staff is indifferent to visitors - guys at the reception seldom take pains to say hello when you pass through the lobby. The room we were staying was smoked through and steady tobacco smell stuck to our belongings. Mini bar is locked, safe is locked - you have to pay extra for them. TV set shuts down as soon as you turn the bedside lamp off, therefore you need to keep the light shining if you want to watch TV. Bathroom facilities are obsolete and barely functioning. Location is absolutely unbeatable but for me this only reason isn't good enough to stay there again.

<Content>Very convenient location - suitable for a short stay Stayed here for 2 nights whilst awaiting a cruise ship. Excellent location with the Metro station almost directly outside. Room was average but clean with a comfortable bed. Breakfast was good with a reasonable selection and overall the hotel was good value for the money paid for the time you would expect to spend in it when visiting Barcelona.Taxis constantly pass outside the front door but the reception desk will order one for you if you want. Beware of this however as the driver adds about another 鈧? ! Reception will keep your luggage after check-out until you are ready to depart.Always try a few words in Spanish - it is appreciated and you will then find everyone very helpful as opposed to expecting the Spanish just to speak English...or judging by the negative comments on here....American ????

<Content>Great Location, BUT... Location is great, walking distance from everything.Room was ok, slightly unusual layout and 2 steps in the room to go from bed to bath -- u might trip in the dark. Room was VERY clean although some hallways were dirty and some ceilings in hallways leaked. Locks are rather outdated, and using a keycard was kinda painfullBreakfast was included, but it's not at all healthy and some items we thought should be warm were cold.We were also disappointed with their safe -- it needs a key which you pay 2E/day and u have to carry key with youAnother disappointment was promise of internet.There is NO WiFi pickup in the room, and when I asked they told me only in the lobby, which is NOT accomodating for the purpose. And it's NOT provided by hotel -- rather by local phone carrier Telefonica which charges what I thought unreasonable rates/terms

<Content>Ok for a short stay We stayed at the Hotel for 2 days. The location of the hotel is perfect for all of the top locations and has some very nice local restaurants. The hotel itself was clean, the linen changed daily and the breakfast was ok but this certainly wasn't 4 star. Our room faced the main street and was very noisy until the early hours and the hotel facilities were very basic. They did have a bar but it was never open.

<Content>Gotico Hotel in Barcelonal, Spain We arrived at the hotel in the a.m. not knowing that the check in time was 1:00. Keep in mind we had jet lag from Orlando, Florida to Barcelona, Spain. The manager at the front desk was not a nice man. He barely looked at us and had an I don't care attitude about the whole problem. We were allowed to check the luggage in but had to sit around or walk the streets barely keeping our eyes open and wait for the check in time. We just wanted to sleep. When we finally got our room, it was very small for a 4 star room. The television did not work very well and the water pressure in the shower was terrible and horrible!!!!  The shower nozzle kept on falling. The room was clean but it smelled musty. We had a balcony which overlooked the city but in order to do it, you had to stand on a scary foot stool in order to see down in the streets. The manager was not at all helpful with taxi information or any other questions about the city. He rarely smiled. Breakfast: The orange juice was full of pulp. It was wonderful. Breakfast was continental style. The coffee was terrible. They had yogurt, bread, sausages, milk, pastries, strange kind of cured meat and a goat flavored type cheese. The cream for the coffee was steaming hot and they had cold milk for the cereal box choices. The sausage was not very good and the eggs were cold. They had a toaster for the toast with jellies. Eating area was very clean....the service was good. The lobby should be smoke free but was not...we had to get used to everyone smoking everywhere.Also found out that dogs were allowed...gross! Didn't see any in the hotel though...no barking either. When we were ready to leave, we asked the front desk about the taxi to take us to the cruise ships. The manager again was not concerned about giving us any information. Too busy looking down at his paperwork....rude.... We had to ask many times for a copy of our paperwork for our files. We ended up walking with our luggage to the cruise ship because the taxi service people were fibbing about it being a holiday. It wasn't a holiday, it was just a Saturday and they wanted to charge an arm and a leg. The front desk could have given us this information. We had to find out about walking several blocks from a near-by store that spoke english. Another lady was crying about her room being filthy and smelly and they also woke her up at 7:00 , barging in without knocking to clean the room and the wake up call was for 11:00 and not 7:00. She was sleeping when they came in and woke her up and scared her. The manager was not trying to fix the problem and it was like ,,,oh well, deal with it. type attitude. The manager asked if she wanted her money back she just wanted to sleep and get moved to another room ...but he wouldn't move her saying the place was full when it was clearly not a full hotel. He said the only rooms available were the suites which would cost her more money. She was very upset. The bar area was never open.If this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel, where is the pool and all of the other things that go with a 4 star hotel. We spoke to someone who went to the Hilton and the Sheriton in Barcelona that was a 4 star and was FANTASTIC and cheaper.The beds were hard and uncomfortable.The manager can be seen in their brochure at the front desk on the left side. Kind of balding with glasses. His assistants were very nice and tried to make up for the manager's attitude.

<Content>Awful Place! This hotel is not a 3.5 or 4 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination. It is possibly a 2 star, and that is being kind to it. The place is dirty, unkept, hallways have holes in the wall and the rooms are dark, dingy and noisy. It was so bad we stayed for 2 hours and checked out even thought we had pre-paid our stay. The location is good, but other than that there is nothing good to say about it. There are far too many other good hotels in Barcelona to stay at this dump!

<Content>OK But Underwhelming The Hotel Gotico is not a bad place, but it is far, far, from a 4-Star hotel. We stayed a true 5-star hotel in Madrid -- the Westin Palace -- and the Gotico is at least two and possibly three levels below that. We ended up there because the nights we were in Barcelona were the festival for the longest days (and shortest nights) of the year, and thus all of the hotels in our books were booked solid. We would not stay there again.The hotel has the ambiance of the places I used to frequent when I used Let's Go to bum around Europe in the 1980s -- diffident front desk staff smoking cigarettes while at work; dark hallways; tiny rooms with sagging narrow beds; a depressing bar and restaurant area, tiny bars of soap, and serviceable but dank-feeling bathrooms. The one huge plus is the location, which is one of the best in the city. The hotel is about a block directly south of the cathedral, which places it directly in the center of the tourist sights -- Las Ramblas to the west, the gothic quarter and the beaches to the south, La Ribera to the east, and fashionable residential areas to the north.

<Content>Nice, clean and positive experience... Read the reviews of the hotel on this site AFTER booking the room and got a bit worried... but for no reason as it turned out...We arrived late (2am) and immediately felt expected by the young english speaking night porter, who had us checked into our room in about 5 minutes. After checking the nice room (even though it's window were facing the back court/roof of the breakfast restaurant) the night porter willingly directed us to an open sandwich bar in the nearby neighbourhood and gave us the key to the in-room minibar. It's true that the hotel/the room seemed a little worn down, and it's true that it's not what I would consider a true 4 star hotel. But more importantly the room was very clean and between the two nights we stayed there the beds were made, towels changed and so on.We were not disturbed by the nearby cathedral's tolling bells, the tv worked very well, the lights worked very well. We had a nice little area with a desk, two chairs and a little table, the beds were comfortable and spacious, the few questions we had at the reception desk were all readily answered in english (not perfect english, but the attempt and effort was certainly made), we had no problems checking out and so on and so on...Breakfast was not included in our price, so I can't comment on that. We had no need for the A/C in the room, but it was there. The A/C in the bathroom was a bit noisy, but turned off with the light, so it was a very little nuisance.Location is EXCELLENT for exploring the wonderful city. Also, lots of restaurants, caf茅s, supermarkets and other shops nearby.We really enjoyed our stay, and I will have no problem at all returning to the hotel (maybe next time we'll find something a little cheaper, as we didn't spend much time in the room).We walked from the bus station to the hotel in the middle of the night, and didn't feel unsafe at all - actually, there were hardly any people on the streets at all. Also, we returned home late at night after a busy day in the town, and then just avoided the small narrow streets in the area (explore them during the day, it's really worth it), and kept to the larger ones...As you can see by now, I find it very difficult to say anything negative about the city or the hotel... GO THERE... :o)

<Content>Avoid room 309 I picked this hotel based on the reviews that I read but I was extremely disappointed. Stayed here for two nights on March 20 through March 22, and I will never never stay here again. Check in was very easy and the location was great. These were the only two good things about the hotel. I know that European hotel rooms are small, but I think that I got the smallest room in the hotel. The room was to the back of the hotel. The bed was a twin size and there was no remote for the television which did not receive great reception on all channels. Also, the television worked with the lights, so I couldn't turn the lights off and watch the television. Both had to be on at the same time. The toilet tank would fill up and empty by itself in the middle of the night. Even closing the door to the bathroom did not help. Since the hotel is close to the Gothic Cathedral, the church bell tolled every hour on the hour. Therefore a good night 's sleep was impossible. The walls were paper thin so I heard the conversations of the guests in the room next door. Only one bath towel was placed in the room. I did not ask to be moved because of my short stay. I kept thinking that maybe I would have gotten a better room if my stay was longer, but since I wasn't impressed over the two nights, I don't plan on finding out.

<Content>Bello Barcelona What a great city ...and the Hotel Gotico suited our needs perfectly!Situated in the old town it was in an ideal location, close to the Jaume Metro station and literally within walking distance of the Cathedral and other museums. The reception staff were polite and answered any questions we had to ask. There was a fairly comfortable reception area and a small bar that we used once. There was also another seating area on the first floor although we didn't use it.Our room 106 was good...on the first floor overlooking the street so there was some noise but nothing too bad. We like bustling cities.It was clean, with comfortable single beds and the bathroom was spacious with twin washbasins and a jacuzzi bath. No hint at all of the drains mentioned in previous reviews!The breakfasts were good too. Plenty of choice...all the usual continental fare plus bacon,eggs and a toasting machine. The staff were efficient and kept the food topped up. Our only criticism would be the noise...mainly from the other guests scrapping their chairs back on the tiled floor. Perhaps we are used to a gentler start to the day?As for eating out in the evening we found an excellent restaurant,Cafe de l'Academia, just 2 minutes around the corner in Carrer Lledo. It is only open at 8.45pm from Monday to Friday and judging by the full tables I think it would be best to book. We enjoyed 2 delicious meals there at a reasonable price.And now for Barcelona! What a great place for a city break. Must see places are obviously the Sagrada Familia. Nothing had quite prepared us for this visit. I had read up a bit before hand but hadn't quite grasped the sheer scale of this project....what had already been built and how much there was still to complete. One majestic building site! Get there early....the queues built up over the day. Guell Park was interesting too, another testimony to the genius of Gaudi, although be prepared for a steep walk uphill from the Metro station. We also really enjoyed our visit to Musee Picasso, a wonderful collecton of some of his early work as well as the later styles that he became famous for.  I could go on and on...... but I won't. Needless to say we will be going back to visit some of the things we missed, to revisit those we really enjoyed and we would definitley use the Gotico again.

<Content>Great location, clean room but not much else Myself and 4 friends booked this city break for our 40th birthdays and from the previous reviews were a little worried about what we might expect. To be honest, they are all accurate!Good points:Great location - Hotel Gotico is about a 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas and surrounded by great restaurants and shops. You could not wish for a better location.As there were 5 of us we were given a twin and triple room. The twin room was quite small but our room was huge (I think there're some photos of our room earlier on in this thread) and consisted of a twin room, separate single bedroom a bathroom and separate toilet.Clean - The room was extremely clean and the maids did a great job of servicing the rooms. The beds were made daily and fresh towels (which unfortunately had seen better days) were supplied.Breakfast - the breakfast (although typically continental) was more than adequate and on the final day we found some bacon and sausage which we hadn't spotted before. Not so good points:As stated by so many other reviewers, the hotel is definately not 4 star. It does not offer any facilities other than bed and breakfast and even though there is a bar in the reception area we never saw it open. We did enquire when it opened and were told in the morning but we never saw it open then either. It was frustrating that outside of breakfast time you could not even get a cup of coffee.Our rooms were on the back of the hotel. As they had no proper windows (ours looked out onto a ventilation shaft and the laundry area), it was very dark. As stated in the previous couple of reviews there was an awful drain smell, in our room made worse each time we flushed the toilet, to the point that we had to warn each other when we flushed the loo so we all prepared for the smell. However, you tend to become more immune to it as time goes on.The staff were ok and answered our questions, ordered taxis etc but they were not particularly friendly, rarely smiled and everything seemed like too much effort.In summary, Hotel Gotico is great if you just want a place to rest your head at night. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, cafes within walking distance so is ideal if you don't want to spend much time in your hotel, which in all honesty you shouldn't wish to do in a city like Barcelona.

<Content>Hotel not very good. Booked a 4* thinking it would be lovely - but we were wrong.Hotel staff really unfriendly, generally smelt of drains, breakfast appalling (had to point out the out of date yoghurts to staff). Should really be rated a 2*.Apart from that the location was spot on and Barcelona is a fantastic place to visit. Recommend the tour bus and trip up the Gaudi temple.

<Content>Great Location I had booked this hotel before I read the reviews and was really worried that I had made a mistake.We found the hotel to be in a brilliant location - less than 5 min walk from La Ramblas, surrounded by really good restaurants that seemed to cater for all tastes and budgets.As regards the hotel itself, it was really nice. Reception staff were polite and helpful any time we spoke to them. As for our street facing room, it was spotlessly clean. The shower worked well and the bathroom was also really clean. I will definitely stay here again when I return to Barcelona and have no problem recommending it to other people.

<Content>Not as bad as it seems after reading old reviews i was dreading my stay at this hotel. however i found it clean, staff friendly and the location was excellent. Perhaps its more a 3 star rather than a 4 but overall very satisfied with the hotel and would highly recommend it.its only a 5 minute walk to the rambles and for Irish people there are 4 Irish pubs a mere 5 minute walk away.

<Content>Great loction, bad service We spent 5 days in Barcelona and stayed at Hotel Gotico. The location was great, but the service was poor. To check in, we had to wait 2 hours. We had asked for a nice room with balcony and a king size bed, but the room we got didn't have a balcony and neither a window!!! After we had spoke to the reception we got a room with windows but no balcony and two single beds.The room was quite big and clean, but the breakfast was poor.We can't agree that the Hotel Gotico it a four star hotel.

<Content>Can be better! Service not good! My wife and i stayed in this hotel for 3 nights less than 2 weeks ago. If you are after the location then this is a good choice, since it is walking distance from La Rambla, and other touristic places.However the service is not so good, especially the person manning the reception desk during the days when we were there. He was not smiling, was not interested to answer our questions (as if we were a big burden to him). I wouldn't recommend staying here since there are so many hotels in the Gothic quarter.The other thing that i found lacking was even though there was a Wifi hotspot (Telefonica) in the hotel, they were not selling the prepaid cards to guests who want to avail of the service. They probably do not have many businessmen staying in the hotel. When i asked about this, they said the internet connection in the bar was free, but when i tried it several times it was not. They don't even know! I have brought my laptop with me during business trips and this is the only time i was not able to buy a prepaid internet card from the hotel.

<Content>Value for money Perfect setting to visit the oldest area in Barcelona. The room we had was comfortable but the bathroom would have benefited from better towels. The hotel lacks a lounge area but has a small bar, however this lacks proper staff and, whilst we were there, had no bottle opener !On the whole clean and good value for money with an adequate breakfast.

<Content>Great location, spotless clean  This hotel is in perfect central location. 5 minutes walk from La Ramblas. 10 minutes walk from The Port and just steps away from three Irish bars, cafes, restaurants and cute little shops.Hotel rooms and bathrooms are very spacious and spotless clean. The hotel staff are very friendly  helpful, with good English.One thing that would probably not suit the average Irish person like myself, was the breakfast. Was typical Spanish buffet breakfast, which we didn't find very appetising. Other than that, would definitley recommend this hotel.

<Content>Hmm, not a great hotel We stayed at the Gotico Hotel for 4 nights in January 2006. We had never been to Barcelona before and were looking forward to it. It was our 10th wedding anniversary and I had asked for an especially nice room prior to our stay. When we got there the room had twin beds and a really musty drain type smell. We stuck with it for the first night but asked to be moved to a room with a double bed (as requested on booking the hotel). We moved rooms the next day but this 2nd room was a lot smaller and the bathroom wasn't big enough to swing a cat! Again, there was a bad drains smell and the taps were falling off the wall in the bath. At least the first room was twice the size and had a bigger bathroom with taps that were in one piece.The hotel was in a fantastic location and it really was a shame that the hotel was dreadful. The breakfasts weren't much to shout about either and the tv in both rooms we stayed in only received foreign channels which we couldn't understand. When we asked at reception about the channels they sent someone up to look at them who played around with the remote for a while and then just said it doesn't work sorry.In general, good location, great city but rubbish hotel. I wouldn't recommend it at all. Maybe we had been spoilt in the past having stayed in some fabulous hotels including Dubai, Copenhagen, Hong Kong and many more. I am not sure where in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona has a good hotel to be honest, they all looked the same!

<Content>Bypass this awfull hotel!!! The location of the hotel is very good, but unfortunatelly that is all the good news! We stayed two nights while on a 16 day tour of Spain and the room we were assigned was just slightly larger than the closet. The room fixtures were in very poor shape as were the bathroom faucets. And in spite of it being unusually warm in Spain this Fall, the AC was out of service because it is winter now. Walk a bit further and find a cleaner and better place. For what we paid we could have done a lot better.

<Content>Gotico Hotel great location but the hotel is awful Just returned from 4 night break in this fantastic city. Everything was great except the hotel - it was dreadful. Grubby, dingy room. Tiny window that looked out onto a flat roof above the dining room. Holes in curtains. The linen and towels had seen better days but were at least clean. Air conditioning that didn't work and an indifferent attitude from staff. No public rooms with exception of the reception area that appeared to double as a residents lounge and small barThe breakfast was awful and the dining room staff even worse. The hotel needs to be completely refurbished and staff need to be trained in the art of at least pretending they enjoy providing a service to their paying guests.Worst 4 star hotel we have stayed at couldn't wait to leave. It spoiled an otherwise brilliant weekend.

<Content>Great location, but a bit too gothic Found the room a bit dark and dingy- only one lamp was used to light the entire bedroom part. The window was also small. But our problems were mainly with the electrics and then the staff at reception. The bulb lighting the room broke on the second day and also tripped the fuse box which meant we were in darkness. I went to the reception and told them- after a struggle with the language barrier a man came to help. He fiddled with the fuse box and replaced the bulb; which blew for a second time! He then left us in darkness and promised he would be back soon. He never came despite us phoning reception again. We therefore spent one night in darkness and could not even see to use the bathroom. Actually, the cleaners were excellent and tidied the room better than we expected, we decided that they had probably fixed the buld for us the next day! However, we came to use the minibar in our room and found this to be broken. We reported every time we went through reception (upto 4 times a day) and they always promised they would look at it. On three ocasions the receptionists came took look. But each time the only changed the socket into which it was plugged. This was not the problem and we struggled to exlplain this too them. Finally, on the second to last night (we were only there for 6!), the fuse went again. Only this time it was more serious because it effected the power on the whole floor. The receptionist eventually rang for an electrician. Again, the bathroom and bedroom were too dark to use. Im sure you will be pleased to know that the electrician did come and fix the problem as well as the minibar fridge. Amusingly, after he went we found we could turn the TV on and off using the same switch to turn the light on in the main room. Very dodgy.We found the location of the hotel to be perfect. Its right in the gothic quarter so that it had quick access to many attractions including the Picasso museum. Les Rambles (a busy street with good night life) was also very close. If you want to make regular trips to the beach then this probably isn't the place for you. However, there is an underground station dead close wich we used for the duration of the holiday. This was ample for our needs. One word of warning however-- My girlfriend got her bag snatched from her hand as we walked back along the main street to the hotel (at 2am). Pick pockets are bad everywhere in Bcn so DO NOT think that the problem was the position of the hotel. Luckily I chased the thief down the winding side streets and managed to get the bag back. If you need a bag then wear it around your neck and keep the minimum cash etc.. on you.

<Content>Should be called Gotta go! Disgusting, moldy, mildew smell throughout. Rooms are the size of a shoebox. Staff is unproffessional and act as though they have never heard these complaints before. Cigarette burn in the toilet seat. Left immediately and found the Majestic, which is lovely.

<Content>No problems at the Gotico Having read some posts on this thread I was some what apprehensive about booking in however I needn't have worried. The hotel is clean and tidy and the staff helpful. It is positioned well within walking distance of the must see sights just off the Ramblas. I was with a group of females and we walked around the area at night with no more fear than i would walking around in the uk in the early hours. There was slight road noise but it is a hotel in the middle of a capital city so you would expect that but we had a lovely little balcony from which we could watch Spain go by - that is after all why we went there!!!!Breakfast was acceptable with a wide range of things to suit all nationalities and there was enough to more that keep us going till lunch time.All in all if you want a tidy hotel in the middle of things then book the Gotico as it will leave you with more money to spend on the open top bus tour which is also well recommended.I would not hesitate to book this hotel again

<Content>gotico was brilliant we stayed at the gotico just before xmas 2004 where we took our 10 year old. we had a triple room and i was abit dubious after reading the bad reviews but i would recommend it and stay there again. the staff were most helpful and friendly and even after we checked out looked after our baggage so we could look round the town. our room faced the front and while some say its noisy i say its really getting into the buzz of things. we had a lovely balcony the room was cosy and clean and everything was there. it was right in the heart of this wonderful city and right opposite is a lovely little cafe for morning coffee. all 3 of us enjoyed it and it was an excellant price for an excellant hotel. if you want the hub and excitement barcelona brings especially if staying with children this hotel is the perfect choice

<Content>Would stay at a different hotel next time We stayed here at the recommendation of an agent mostly due to the location being within walking distance of many attractions. I was worried after reading the reviews. I found the younger hotel front desk staff (males) to be kind of rude. They gave us a room at first that had 2 twin beds instead of the double that we had booked and also the electronic key didn't work. They handed us a metal key and were smirking. We made them change our room. The older hotel front desk staff (also all males) were more accomodating and more helpful. We had room 316 which was very quiet, it faced the alley and not the busy street below. We did not have problems hearing plumbing and our water pressure was good. We are castillian spanish speakers so we feel we had an advantage over non-spanish speakers. The staff did not seem to treat the non-spanish speakers the same. We observed someone trying to check in and the attitude of the front desk seemed like they were bothered to have to help people who did not know spanish. We were here July 2004. We noticed a hotel called the Rialto that was only a few doors down and they seemed nice. We walked in to Hotel Rialto to grab a few brochures and the front desk said hello and asked us if they could help us. My husband asked them for some opinions on the local attractions and directions and they were very helpful.
