<Content>Great location, but noisy We selected Villa Cofresi based on reviews here and for its location and price. In the end, we were not disappointed, although we did find it to be a bit rough around the edges (dirty carpets, old furniture) and quite loud at times (even though we were in PR during a relatively low season). The noise stems from the fact the this hotel has a bar right in the center of its main courtyard area, and noise rise up to all rooms from there. The bar is nicely located for guests, but also seems to be the main bar on the beach, and thus most of the clientele are not staying at the hotel and it is active all day long (sunsets are great from here, so no surprise there). I awoke one Sunday morning at 9 am to the sounds of Michael Jackson. The next day, a Monday, we were awaken at 7:30 am, when the maintenance staff decided to begin work on replacing some tile (ie, construction work). I prefer to sleep a little later when I am on vacation and after having listened to the jukebox until 1 am the night before. On the plus side, there are some suitable restaurants within walking distance (try Rincon Tropical for seafood, and Cerdito del Cielito for some very good BBQ). The bar makes excellent mojitos and charges on $3 for a cold beer). The bar is right next to the small beach, which is protected enough to be excellent for swimming. There is also a small but very clean swimming pool. Also, the Cofresi largely caters to a Puerto Rican guest base and we found this to be a plus. The breakfast is one of the less inviting I have had but at least there is something available. For the price - we paid $155 for a room with ocean view and balcony on the third floor - this is a decent enough place. We would certainly stay here again, but would not look forward to the heavy traffic congestion that you will encounter as you return to San Juan (the worst traffic we experienced during our trip around the island).

<Content>Definitely Returning We stayed here for 4 nights in Sept '08 with our daughter, celebrating her 15th bday, our cousin, celebrating his 21st bday. We had a great time with the bartenders! Chichi will definitely make you laugh. Sunsets are AMAZING!! Rooms are clean and hotel grounds are well-kept. Food is incredible from the bar/grill and their restaurant! Just as the title states....we are returning February 09 and bringing more new guests with us to experience this incredible, homey beach hotel!!!!!

<Content>Our favorite hotel in Puerto Rico We have stayed at this hotel many times, In fact we were married there on the beach 4 years ago. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a way to truly experience the real Puerto Rico. The deluxe rooms are huge and the private balcony is wonderful. The food served at both the pool bar and the restaurant is a great value and very well prepared . As for reading other reviews both myself and my family were not treated as gringos but welcomed by all staff who went out of their to be helpful and friendly. Sandra who was in charge of our wedding and reception was fantastic to deal with. You can't ask for nicer people and Rincon is a lovely place to vacation.

<Content>BED BUGS Yes, it is true.We stayed here for four days and not only contracted bed bugs the last night we were there, we brought them home. I am a very clean person and also a doctor, so I know what I am talking about.I contacted Rita Caro when I got home to let her know, she said she did not think this was their problem but would get back to me.Well, she never called me back and so I feel I gave them a chance to rectify the situation - 5 months in fact.But now that I think about the expensive exterminator and dry cleaning bills, I think others who consider staying here should be fairly warned.If you don't mind the possibility of bed bugs, and are looking for a cheap, casual place with loud music on the beach, this place is for me.As for me, I will definitely not be returning.

<Content>Caution - Not a Quiet Retreat My daughter and I stayed here four nights in June. Our third floor room was clean, well maintained and comfortable with a large balcony on the beach (located in a separate building to the south of the main hotel building. The hotel staff was polite and efficient but not exactly friendly. The hotel guests are almost exclusively Puerto Ricans and its a great place for families with young children and teens alike. However, the noise from the bar every night until midnight and then noise from guests on the beach until 3:00 am was ridiculously loud. Despite using ear plugs, having the air-conditioner fan on high and leaving the TV on, the outside noise made evenings miserable. Why not join in the fun, you ask. Well, the locals aren't exactly friendly to 'gringos'. Our first night we went to the bar and sat right at the bar. The bartender waited on everyone else, walked by us several times without so much as acknowledging our presence, waited on newcomers and then finally, when he decided we weren't going to leave, acted surprised to see us and took our drink order. Took him another 10 minutes to bring us two cold beers. We thought it was just the bartender's attitude, but after four days it was pretty obvious (because of other incidents) that our gringo presence was not welcome at this locals resort. The onsite restaurant serves a good variety of good food for dinner and the free breakfast (mostly carbs) was well presented and fresh. If you are looking for a good family resort on a great swimming beach, you'll love this place. If you're looking for a quiet beach resort, best look elsewhere.

<Content>Like your most comfortable old shoes We are long-time fans of this family-operated hotel (but it's more like a big home). There are many repeat guests who look forward to seeing one another year after year. The staff could not be more accommodating - any request gets their best effort. We think this place is best for an extended stay because each annual visit benefits from discovering what's that season's best feature (restaurant, site to visit, etc.). There is a personality component in the reactions to this place. If you want luxury, gambling and wearing jewels to dinner, go to San Juan -- this place is much too laid back for you. Alternatively, good safe beach, comfortable rooms (choose to fit your tastes - active bar area, pool access or remote), wide selection of local dining opportunities, convenient supermarket, free wi-fi availability and amiable clientele all contribute to the quality of your stay. All this at reasonable prices -- about the only place you detect the economizing is in the Continental breakfast, but you can save your caloric intake to indulge in a nice fish dinner (try a whole snapper, called chillo entero).

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Pirate My friend and I just returned from the Villa Cofresi after a 4 day stay. I was told to stay there by a coworker who said it was a clean, friendly, and accomodating hotel with a private beach. The hotel lived up to my expectations. The staff was very helpful with restaurant suggestions, places to visit, and arranging a taxi to the airport. (As a side note, I wish I had rented a car as driving is neccessary to see most of Rincon.) The beach was small but very clean and I never had trouble getting a lounge chair. The pool was less than fatastic but who needs a pool when you have a calm, clean ocean to swim in.My room was ocean front on the first floor. As read in many reviews the bar can be noisy, so its best to stay in a room far from the bar, which I did and it was perfect. All I heard at night was the crashing waves. My only complaint is the service at the bar. I felt ignored often by the bar tenders. It took over 5 minutes to get my drink order most of the time. I actually walked away frustrated several times without a drink because I couldn't wait any longer. If you can get your drink, make sure it's Cofresi's famous Pirate. It's served in a freshly cut coconut and it's delicious!

<Content>Old dated hotel Just returned from Villa Confresi spending one evening. I was travelling with two others and they offered a two bedroom unit. which was $160.00 per night including continental breakfast. The hotel itself is right on a great beach, has a great beach bar overlooking the beach and the fabulous sunset. The drinks are great, the restaurant at this hotel is also very good. The rooms are dated to the 1970's. They are in need a renovating big time. The bathrooms are old, musty and not very clean. If you don't mind all of the above go there for the beach and bar, other than that don't stay there.

<Content>Fabulous Customer Service, Superior Ocean View A neighbor who is from Rincon recommended this lodging. From the moment we started working with the staff to plan our vacation (we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary) we noticed that our requests were treated with prompt response. The staff, including housekeeping and security, greeted us warmly and the front desk personnel bent over backwards to treat us with kindness. The manager treated us with great courtesy and allowed us to use the hotel computer printer when our laptop did not work. The food and beverage manager and restaurant staff geniunely made our celebration the best ever and truly served the absolute best food we tasted anywhere on the island. The bar staff was entertaining and quick to serve.All in all we would highly recommend this hotel to travelers. The rooms are not plush but very nice and well appointed. The hotel is on the beach with all the aminities (beachside shower, lounge chairs, etc.). The bar is a major hotspot on weekends but the staff handles parking well and we were never bothered by the noise. Rincon has beautiful beaches and genuinely nice people. Everyone there seems to exhibit a love of life and an energy we have never witnessed anywhere else.

<Content>Very Pleased My wife and I stayed for four nights. We had a room on the third floor facing the ocean. It was 167 USD or so per night. This room was worth every penny. The hotel itself was cute, right on the beach, and very clean. I recommend if you are there for quiet and ocean view you request the full ocean view with balcony. We loved the balcony and spent each night watching the sunset from it. The rooms were clean and the maid service excellent. The staff was very accommodating. The beach was not the cleanest but for the money I have no complaints. It was tolerable and this time of year we had no problem finding a chair. We walked on the beach everyday, swam every morning in the ocean, and ate at the very fine restaurant right in the hotel. The bar is loud at night and i don't think we could have stayed in a room near it. Again, request the ocean view room they feature on the website. It is worth it.

<Content>Loved this place My husband  I stayed in this hotel for 1 week. It was honestly one of the best places we've ever been (and we travel alot). The beach is beautiful , the pool was a perfect size for the kids, the decor of the hotel was adorable and the food in the hotel and the surrounding restaurants was amazing. The hotel is a very relaxing, perfect place to visit. It's not over the top and that what makes it so great. When it was time to go home we didn't want to leave. We actually are going back in april of this year.

<Content>Easily the best hotel in Rincon If you come to Rincon - which I strongly recommend - you won't find a better place to stay than this family run hotel. It's right on the beach, the rooms are beautiful and well maintained, and the staff are super friendly and helpful. Villa Cofresi is managed by a lovely lady called Sandra Caro, and her husband Tito. It's big enough to offer the facilities you'd expect from a larger, more expensive establishment, but not so big that it loses the personal touch.I stayed at Villa Cofresi with my girlfriend over Christmas 2007 and the New Year. We had looked at a number of hotels including Rincon of the Seas next door (overpriced and lacking atmosphere) and smaller guest houses (too basic and in some cases, not very clean) and, because we arrived very late and hadn't made any plans, stayed our first night in the 鈥淟azy Parrot鈥?(quaint, but cramped, and miles from the beach). When we arrived at the hotel we were immediately made to feel very welcome by Sandra and her staff. Could we borrow an iron? No problem - we were given one to keep for the whole fortnight. Do you have any parasols for the beach? Two appeared the following day, and again these were ours to use throughout our stay. When we wanted to hire jet-skis they negotiated a discount for us. Nothing was too much trouble - we were made to feel completely at home from the moment we arrived till the morning we sadly had to wave goodbye. The one event which really stands out above all others as an example of this hotel's fantastic attitude towards its guests is the way Sandra and Tito helped us with a shopping trip to Mayaguez.* We asked at reception for someone to call us a taxi to take us to the big shopping mall in Mayaguez, about 40 minutes' drive away. They tried a few numbers but no one was available for a few hours, which would have been too late. We were debating whether we should book someone to take us the following morning when Sandra appeared and asked us if she could help. She immediately told us that Tito had to go into Mayaguez anyway and would gladly take us with him. He did so, and would have waited for us to shop but we knew we were going to be a few hours and said we would find a taxi to bring us back. Well, we did a lot of good shopping, but the next day I realised that because of a mix-up I had left my bank card in one of the shops. Once again Sandra was brilliant. First she called around the shops to find my card and then said that she would pick it up for me in the evening as she had to go there to buy a few things for the hotel's New Year celebrations. She delivered it back to me personally at 10.30 that night. How many hotel managers do you know who would go the extra mile like this?We were told that Villa Cofresi has been owned by Sandra's family for a number of years, possibly ever since it was founded. This is what makes all the difference. As owner managers, rather than mere members of staff working for some anonymous proprietor, Sandra and Tito instinctively understand that the success of their business depends on total customer satisfaction, and that's exactly what they give. The hotel has a genuine family atmosphere, with everyone working together to provide their guests with everything they need to enjoy their stay. As well as being ideal for couples like us - you can always find a quiet corner! - Villa Cofresi is also perfect for guests with children, because the beach bar (the only one along this stretch of coast, as far as we could see) allows parents who want to enjoy a drink or meal to keep an eye on their children swimming a few yards away.In conclusion, I cannot recommend Villa Cofresi highly enough - just go there and you will see for yourselves. This is a special place run by special people.* I should explain that we made the mistake of not hiring a car for our stay in Puerto Rico. We have travelled all around the Caribbean, and everywhere else the easiest way to get around is to hail a taxi or, more often, one of the locals who ferry people around to earn some extra cash. In Puerto Rico generally there aren't many taxis, in Rincon hardly any at all, so if you're planning to do any sightseeing you really do need to hire. Unfortunately we hadn't brought our drivers licences so we had to make do as best we could.

<Content>Not luxury but many good features A friend and I stayed at the Villa Cofresi for a girls' vacation. The staff was very friendly and helpful. For example, my mattress was very saggy and they replaced it. I also locked the keys to my rental car in the trunk of the car and although the town locksmith was nowhere to be found the hotel staff went out of their way to find someone else in town who could help me.The hotel was very clean and safe. The bar is noisy on Friday and Saturday nights, but our room faced the other side of the hotel and with the air conditioner running we could not hear much except a bit of bass. The hotel is not fancy, the room was enormous, which was very nice, and the bathroom seemed newly renovated (with a jacuzzi tub). Otherwise the furnishings were in line with your regular Days Inn, etc level. The breakfast was as a previous reviewer described, but the cereal is Kellogg's cereal in plastic packaging, the muffins are the commercially made ones, the fruit was pears or melon from the US, the waffles are freezer waffles, so it's nothing to write home about. Most of the activities and restaurants we enjoyed (snorkeling, horseback riding, surfing) were on the other side of town so it was good to have the rental car.All in all I thought it a bit overpriced, the smaller hotels that were in similar price range seemed nicer from the outside, but this was a reasonable alternative.

<Content>We are Hospitality professionals on vacation....we loved this place. I have been visting Puerto Rico for 30 years. Until recently, I really hadn't gotten to know the town of Rincon on the country's west coast. During my last trip, 2 years ago, I stopped by the Villa Cofresi to check out the facilities and I got a really great vibe from the place. In fact, I was so impressed that I promised myself that I would try it out on my next visit. I did just that this past April with a group of friends, both from PR and from outside the island. It's not luxurious or brand new or anything like that. What it is, is a very comfortable, very clean and very cool hotel right smack on one of Rincon's best beaches. It is crewed by a really professional and service oriented staff. It is a relaxing hotel which espouses to beach culture. Great beach, great pool, great bar, gardens, folks....etc....There is a rustic bar overlooking the beach which is happening both during the afternoon and at night. It is a bit of a scene most evenings but closes early, by 12 or 1. On one night, even though I had been up all day, I actually wished that it would have stayed open later as an eclectic group of folks do assemble there. The staff at Villa Cofresi provide great service and are just charming and welcoming.Most notable was Sandra Cortes. She was so kind to our party and provided us with everything from driving directions to locals attractions; dining suggestions; and useful historical and cultural background information about the area and about Puerto Rico in general. I shall stay at Villa Cofresi again and again.

<Content>Excellent Place to Stay This hotel was magnificent. I had such a good time I did not wanted to leave. Everything was convinient the location, jet skyiing, canoying, banana boat ride, stores, food, ext. I will return to this hotel. Not to mention my daughters had a good time. Also, my 19 year old wore a bickini and my other daughter along with other women and we did not feel out of place as one traveler stated and my 19 year old daughter is a model. The bar help, front desk, waiters, housekeepers were very nice and friendly. Not to mention the food was delicious.

<Content>Fantastic Service We arrived a few hours early and asked if we could leave the car while we walked around, they checked on our room and allowed us to check in early since it was already cleaned. When I informed them we were now a party of three (my MIL decided to come) they found us a different room with the extra bed - they actually showed us two rooms and let us pick the one we wanted. They then cleaned that one ASAP so we could still check in early! I could go on and on about the service we received, but right from the get go, their entire staff went above and beyond. The pool is loud though, so get a room off the central courtyard, that's the only thing keeping it from 5 stars.

<Content>What a wonderful value!! We didn't know what to expect when we booked the Villa Confresi over the internet. You know the pictures look great but really, the hotel is much NICER than the pictures can tell. The staff was very friendly and heipful. The free continental breakfast was fantastic! Each morning we had 3 different bagels, breads, and muffins, 3 different fresh fruits, there were pancakes, waffles, and french toast, cold cereal, juices, milk, coffee and omelets could be purchased for $4.50. We didn't need to eat again until almost 3:00. We found the food at the restaurant and around town to be very good and reasonably priced. The beach was right outside our room. We were there on the weekend which seemed busy but we had no problem finding a chair on the beach and my son and husband found an open pool table whenever they felt like a game. At night there is security guard watching the parking lot so that only guests frequent the bar and pool. I always felt safe where ever I went. On the weekends there was much music and gaiety. If your room is on the inside of the horseshoe shaped hotel you will hear musci until 11:30 pm so if you are a light sleeper be sure to ask for a room away from the bar area. After 11:00 though, you will be able to hear the waves crashing up on the beach. We will be back to Villa Confresi for sure! Enjoy!

<Content>Better than expected We walked in and booked 3 nights here because it was in a very good location for a family. Rincon is not the typical white sand, clear water beach that you would expect from the carribean. Also the beaches are very short, hotels are built very close to the water. It takes some getting used to if you are spoiled like we are. But it does grow on you and after a few days we did not want to leave. The rooms here are plain, outdated, and a little run down but clean. The location is perfect. The pool tables are great for teenagers. We had dinner 1 night and it was very good. The hotel staff was very nice and very quick to help in any way possible. With all things considered, I feel it is the best place to stay in Rincon and would return.

<Content>Nice place to stay The place was clean. The beach is great. We had a room with a balcony facing the ocean. Very nice staff. The bar serves great strong drinks,try the drink in the coconut . There was noise from the bar but the ocean drowned out most of it. Great place to relax or join in on the fun at the bar. Mixed crowd, old , young, plump and thin and everything in between. We had a great time. We will stay there again.

<Content>a party of 50 from NY I stayed at the Villa Cofresi form Feb. 15-23. We came down with about 50 people from Babylon NY everyone loved it and had a good time . We all had teenagers with us who surfed. the surfing beaches are 7 minutes away and the beach outside the hotel is usually very calm for swimming. this is the second year we have stayed there, the staff if so polite and accomodating to you it is such a pleasure. This is a one of the original hotels on the beach which is family owned and we saw the owner often who is a doll. I recommend this hotel highly . There is something to do everynight all the other hotels come to the bar everynight for happy hour. A fun filled time for all ages and there ar not fat old senior citizens there are people of all ages. I highly recommend it. Clean just not fancy

<Content>clean but warning about fellow travelers We booked 3 nights at Villa Cofresi but only ended up staying 2 of them. The hotel is clean and in a nice location. My warning is about the other travelers staying there. This place is full of elderly people, children and gigantic american butts. It has a very conservative vibe to it. I felt out of place the entire time in my bikini . My husband and I are in our early 40's, fit, and active and we did not enjoy the company at this place. I couldn't wait to get out of here and go to another hotel. This is not a reflection on the hotel because they book rooms but be warned about the people who stay there. Yikes! If you don't like looking at obese Americans don't go here.Side Note: The bar help is horrible be prepared to wait and wait to get a drink. Very unorganized. Great food but once again be prepared to wait.

<Content>Fun Place We just returned back from a six night stay in Puerto Rico, 4 nights in Condado and two in Rincon at Villa Cofresi. We wished we had stayed a couple of more nights, Rincon was a long drive for just two nights. The hotel was decent, a little worn down but right on the beach. The rooms were bigger than expected; ours had a great ocean view. The whole area has a laid back beach bum vibe, which we liked. The beach bar has great drinks, great views and great happy hours. The bar can get very crowded and loud and remain that way into the early morning. It is fantastic for sun set .We were there on a Wednesday and Thursday, which was fine for us, I can鈥檛 imagine what it is like on weekends. If you are looking for a fun, beachfront hotel with a great bar then you will like this place. If you are looking for a romantic quite place, I would stay elsewhere. One thing that surprised us was the on site restaurant, it was excellent for dinner, in fact we thought our food was better there than at the Parrot Club in Old San Juan.

<Content>Great hotel I went to Villa Cofresi from Tuesday to Wednesday. I got a great room with a view in front of the beach. It was very clean, it had all the ammenities you can expect for that price and the size of my room and bed were very big.The bar scene is too loud for my taste, but my room was away from the bar- and from my room I could only hear the waves of the sea. The restaurant environment is nicer than the bar and there are also other tables away from the bar where you can have your drink.

<Content>Confresi was best for our needs We were a party of 5 with 4 seniors and a teenager staying there over Christmas. We were originally given rooms overlooking the pool, but I had read about possible noise and asked about it. The person I talked to was very honest and said that the only thing else available was on the third floor, and there was no elevator. I decided to take those anyway. We were in rooms 327 and 329 which were directly at the top of the stairs. The rooms had two double beds and they brought in a rollaway at no extra charge for our son which the large room held easily. There were minor problems such as burned out lights that needed attention, but the room was clean. Service was always friendly, but not consistent. There were never any hand towels, and we never were given wash clothes, but my sister next door got some, some days. I imagine that had we asked, they would have been provided. The pace of life seemed slower, and we soon adjusted, so some things just weren't a big issue. I didn't know that the rooms had jaccusi tubs, and that was a plus. My sister's didn't work, but for some reason she got premimum channels on her tv while basic cable was what the hotel provided. They also provided large beach towels which was nice. Occasionally we could hear noise from the bar, but our location and the air conditioner blocked out most of it. All in all, we were very satisfied with our rooms. We didn't like the bands that we were supposed to wear to show that we belonged, and after a few days took them off. No one said anything about it. The courtyard in the middle where the pool, bar, restaurant, and bar, and pool tables are located is a great spot for mingling and people watching. There was live music a couple of nights and a karaoke night also. We never noticed anybody acting drunk and felt it was a good place for our teenager to hang out. There was a game room and everyone used the pool tables. We enjoyed that this area was used, not only by hotel guests, but by locals and guests from other hotels. The people were extremely friendly. We enjoyed talking with them all and shared a local breakfast sandwich with a bridal party staying at three different hotels. My son met other kids from the states and locals who taught him the way they dance.Rincon is a small town without much night life, so this was perfect. There was entertainment if we wanted it, and a safe place for a teenager. We never ate at the restaurant except for the complimentary beakfast. It was basic continental, with a few extras.The best thing about the Confresi was the people. They were always friendly and accomodating. If you wanted to look in the little shop and it wasn't open, they let you in. If you were going fishing before breakfast was available, they put together a bag of food for you and delivered it to your room the night before. When my son wanted to go surfing and the other couple had the car, one of the hotel employees took him and picked him up later.Everything was not perfect, but we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Villa Cofresi Review: Not for Us This hotel is a rather tacky place. It is right on a beach, a very thin strip of brown sand. There are a lot of drinking party types here. It is loud at night--lots of drinking, yelling, smoking, that goes on much of the night. Not suitable for children, in our opinion. The breakfast is quite unhealthy-they were actually serving twinkies, american cheese slices, high fat pastries, ham, etc. Very little fresh food. The whole place smells like rotten produce, because they use coconuts to make some of the drinks and they do not clean out the bar area very well. It is all centered around a bar scene. People get very drunk at night. Loud kareoke singing one night, place full of cigarette smoke. Our apartment (2 bedroom) was just dirty. The floor was filthy, the smaller couch was very stained, the blinds were broken, the air conditioner was very loud, and we could not get cold water (only warm) out of the faucets to drink. In the other deluxe room we stayed in for one night with 2 king beds, the bathroom tub leaked water across the bedroom floor under both beds every time we used the shower. We did get a discount for that, but no apology! The restaurant on the premises was very expensive: $17-23 for an entree, so hardly anyone was eating there. We walked across the street to two local places to eat every night. This place is more appropriate for a younger party drinking crowd, but I would not bring families with children here. We would never return to this place.

<Content>BEST VACACATION WE EVER HAD My wife and i recently stayed at the Villa Confressi , and it was by far the best place we ever stayed at when in Puerto Rico. The place is located on the beach . The place is very very clean and the staff at the resort is family run ans they go out of there way to make your stay a pleasant and safe one. Donot miss the gar which is on the beach with great drinks and burgers. We stayed at room 315 which was on the ocean which also had a great balcony for beautiful sunsets. We can't wait to return to this resort as our stay was a great one

<Content>Nice Place My husband and I just came home after spending 4 nights at this place. Lets start with the good, The place is clean and our room was large facing the beach and we could hear the surf at night. The staff was great and chearful. The food in the resturant was plentyfull and great taste. The breakfast was not good at all. They put out a continental breakfast (very very small). That is fine except when you pay for a package that includes your meals you should get a full breakfast. There is only one more bad thing at this place. When you check in they put a color band on your wrist so you can use the pool. I quess the locals must slip in. The bad thing I mean is that this marks you as a tourist to some not so nice people. So we took ours off. Also there is no shade at all in the pool .

<Content>Mixed Feelings First of all, let me say in advance that I have been an annual guest of Villa Cofres铆 for almost twenty years. I love it because it fulfills my needs, and that is that is right in the beach. The staff is really pleasant and will go out of their way to accommodate their guests' needs. However, I need to point out that security is not as tight as it should be. First, there were people coming in to the beach from the side alley, which were not hotel guests, and appropiated the hotel chaise lounges (one of the days, they were using 11), and even though my husband told one of the employees, no one came to talk to them. The beaches in PR are public, but hotel property is not. Second, kids were running and screaming until late hours, disturbing guests rest (our last night up until 1:00am), and no action was taken. I believe these problems can be corrected easily by hiring one or two security guards to make sure that hotel's rules are followed by all guests. I would hate not to be able to count on Villa Cofresi as my PR summer vacation spot.

<Content>A piece of paradise Last January was our most recent trip to this piece of paradise. We started staying at the Villa in 1978 and have not missed a year since. What started out as a week at Christmas has evolved into 6 weeks between December and February. It is now home away from home.It is a family owned and operated facility that has staffed itself with exellent personnel throughout. The entire staff go out of their way to assure the quality of your stay. We are returning again this year, to renew acquaintances and to enjoy our stay with friends that we have made over the years.

<Content>truly authentic puertorican parador my family and i went to p.r. for 9 nine days and we wanted to see the whole island so we rented a truck and did some hotel hopping. villa cofresi is a government approved local motel which is called a parador. the flavor of the whole experience including the drive and the town is truly authentic. no san juan here. the hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. the room we were given was really not modern and definitely needed to be refurbished. but the desk did try to move us but there were no other two bedroom kitchenettes available. the beach bar was great and we really enjoyed chi chi and chuito. the pool was okay and the beach was fantastic. the hotel IS right on the beach.no not white sand etc. but truly beautiful and rugged. the sea is not so rough that the kids couldnt play. there was also a game room . we really enjoyed our stay here and would go back and recommend it to others.

<Content>a great place to stay/reasonably priced Hi there.. Can't say enough about the hotel... a friend and I were traveling from Fajardo when we took a ride to the other side of the island and literally fell upon this hotel... It was clean, staff friendly, and can't understand - where the bartenders were unfriendly... They couldn't be more helpful , attentive and efficient. We met so many people down there from the states, we decided to go back during the New Year holiday and had a blast..If your looking for the Ritz Carlton - not here, but you couldn't ask for nicer people and clean hotel.... i will be back - for sure. Thanks Cofressi - (girls from New Jersey)

<Content>Left a little to be desired A beautful area to visit, but the Hotel is a little tired. The pool is small (but clean), the dining room was fair (cleanliness and quality nothing to write home about). The room was large, but needed an update.People were very friendly. We were a family of 4 visiting, but the Hotel seems to be better suited to large group visits, and student trips.Attached is a view from the balcony of our room.

<Content>Friendly, fun and inexpensive! This is our favorite beach bar! I have never met the unfriendly bartender that has been mentioned in other reviews and service was great. At sunset you are reminded of Key West, everyone has a drink and cheers the setting of the sun. There is always an available beach chair, whether you are a guest or not. We loved Rincon so much that we finally bought a tiny vacation home here and still come most every evening to watch the sun set at the Villa Confresi. Kick off your fancy city shoes, join the natives, laugh, dance, and have fun! By the way, we're in our 50s not only teenagers party at the Confresi

<Content>location of room very important Having seen the layout of the hotel I can understand that noise would be a problem in many cases. We had a deluxe room with an ocean view and balcony and it could not have been better. Those rooms are in a seperate wing away from all the activity. The only noise we had, day and night, was the ocean. The room was huge, very clean and cheerful. The beach is not terribly attractive compared to others we saw, but at that point in our trip the priority was selecting a place with everything near at hand. We had literally gone around the island and had driven to or walked to many beaches and restaurants. I am not usually attracted to resort-like establishments but I knew I would want a place at the end of the trip that was simply relaxing after so much travelling and sightseeing. I was not disappointed. We were at their bar only one evening and did not have a problem with service. Since we were sitting away at a table I can't comment on the bartenders' friendliness. This is not an expensive establishment so I can't fault their breakfast buffet. It was a little better than others that I experienced. We ate in their restaurant one night and it was good but not exceptional. As others commented, the staff is very friendly and helpful. Considering what you pay for this hotel, I think it is a good value.

<Content>Had a great time! My wife and I just returned from five days/four nights at the Villa Cofresi. We had an absolutely wonderful time and would recommend this resort. The staff are extremely friendly and accomodating. The restaurant is excellent, and it is a joy to sit outside on the patio warching the ocean while eating your meal. The guests are a nice mixture of Puerto Rican families with children and Americal tourists, many of whom have been coming back to the Cofresi for many years (I talked with one upstate New York firefighter who has been coming back for 19 years).The patio does have a jukebox which plays Latino music into the evening (usually until 11:00 PM on weekdays and midnight on weekends). However, we enjoyed the music as we retired to our room. In addition, you fall asleep listening to the sound of the waves crashing right outside your door. The first night back in the US, I had trouble sleeping because it was too quiet.The area does have a problem with beach erosion. The week before we arrived, several large storms had caused the waves to undercut a portion of the patio. The owners were working to restore and strengthen the beachfront. However, at low tide, we had no problem setting up beach chairs right in front of the Cofresi, or walking 100 yeards down the beach to a larger area.The Cofresi is a small 40-year-old resort with a sense of being family run. I would go there again without hesitation. Besides, for $125 per night for an ocean view room, you can not beat the price. Some of the other tonier Rincon resorts would charge twice as much just to stick you in the back.

<Content>Friendly, clean and LOUD! We just returned from 2 nights at Villa Cofresi. The front desk staff is very friendly and kind - the waitstaff in the restaurant not so friendly or efficient. The tip is added to the bill for dinner, so there is no incentive to be attentive or provide excellent service. However, the meals were delicious. Our room was very clean and large, and had a beautiful balcony and view. Unfortunately, it was SO loud after hours! There are many, many kids (mostly teens) and they play the jukebox until very late. We didn't complain, because we loved our view so much, but we did not sleep well at all. The beach is very eroded, but we managed to snag a couple chairs (get out before 9AM) and enoy the day in the water and walking the beach. Lunch at the bar was really good, and service was fast. If you have teens, I highly recommend this hotel. They will have a great time, and it feels very safe. If you value your sleep, I would recommend a room away from the bar/recreation/pool area. Otherwise it was lovely, a great location, nice people vacationing here, warm water and great beach for strolling. No hot water, but decent pressure. We may try another hotel on our next visit, unless we bring our kids (which we didn't this time).

<Content>Came back once,, will not come back twice My GF and I, stayed 4 days last year in Rincon at Villa Cofresi, we really liked it, and when our trip to Vail this winter fell apart, we went back to Rincon and to Cofresi. But this time we were disappointed. First: I agree with a reviewer who said that the bartenders at the bar were unfriendly. That's true. Second: Few storms hit the area prior to our arrival. The BEACH IS GONE. There is only 5-6 feet of sand left now. All the chairs are lined up next to each other and you still get a wave to reach you now and then. We had to fight to get a couple of chairs.Third: Rooms are aging.. but really. Old rooms, but clean..Really clean. We moved from one to another. The first was LOUD, I think the engine or something like that was behind us..the noise was incredible ALL NIGHT long. The Second room was just ugly (probably to make money, they transformed a depot or office into a room)Fourth: The place is Very Very loud at night. KIDS all over the place and abnoxious teenagers.Fifth: The food at the hotel/Bar is decent. The breakfast is cheap and the coffee always COLD. DO NOT EAT at BAMBINO's the so Called italian on the corner ... Waste of money. I've been around the world, never had a Pizza like this one NEVER.Sixth: the nice and fancy restaurant called The Landing is GONE. NO MORE. Vanished. So for dining you have two choices, Calypso and Tamboo.. Both are decent and nicely priced. Lazy Parrot is bad and everthing else is overpriced. Seventh: The Staff is Very Friendly. I think their customer service is one of the best. Very friendly people and very polite. (NOT THE abnoxious bartender though).Eights: Their Famous cocktail Pirates is Good and still consistently good. Watch out, it's probably a 1000Kcal/drink. TRUST me , if you can afford it, try the Copamarina resort in Guanica, the beach is small, but the place is fantastic. Have fun.
