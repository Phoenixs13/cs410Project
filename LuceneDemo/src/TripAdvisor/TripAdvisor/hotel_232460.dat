<Content>Fine place, central location. We were in Amsterdam only for a night last September. Got to know of this hotel through net and reserved one month in advance. Later, while going through the comments of guests and the rating of this hotel, a sort of disappointment crept in us. But still we decided to give it a try.On the whole, this hotel is certainly not as bad as it is made out to be. Staff at the counter were courteous and could converse well in English. We had with us a few heavy suitcases. The person at the counter took our luggage to our first floor room - and there is no lift in the hotel. Hotel was not crowded nor dark  dingy. Staff even gave us directions to visit the tourist centres.Hotel is situated very near to all major tourist attractions in the city. I would certainly recommend this hotel for first time visitors and those with family.A word of caution though - NON REFUNDABLE deposit is mandatory while reserving the rooms. So you are advised to ensure that there is no change in your iterinary. We lost two days of deposit due to change in our plans.RAMESH K R, VIZAG, INDIA

<Content>You find better hotels... The hotel is fairly okay for young people who are in Amsterdam to party and drink. For elderly people, romantic couples and families: Stay away! So hereby you are warned! Positive: Quite helpfull staff, some rooms are okay standard, quite cheap, great location close to Leidseplain party area. Negative: Many rooms are way too small, it`s almost hillarious! Our friends got a room that could easily been in John Cleese`s Fawlty Towers! Our room was okay. But very filthy carpet and curtains. The bathroom was too small, the shower was not function good, the lights was out and there was some constuction work outside the hotel that kept a terrible noise level during Monday-Friday daytime. There was arguing and loud discussions between unsatesfied customers, and those in the reception several times we passed. Not a good sign...In other words: Pay a bit more and you will find way better hotels in Amsterdam. This is not worth your hard-earned-cash.

<Content>Don't care Quentin The fact that you book a budget hotel does not give the owners the right to take your money and provide dirty unkempt accomodation to guests. A air of neglect is the general theme of the hotel (apart from the reception area). The bench outside had a completely broken seat and dead conifer sat alongside it. Our room was a triple, second floor. Bathroom clean but broken shower head. Carpet stained and dirty, walls dirty scuff marks on them, all paintwork badly chipped ,window frame rotten and would not close properly on second floor so what horrified me was a child could fall out of the window. Glass shade from wall light was lying on the floor with a jagged edge, again someone could have badly cut themselves on it, reception staff did not seem bothered at all when I pointed this out. A lovely array of cobwebs were hanging from the light ceiling fitting and exposed wires on wall sockets. A new one on me despite having travelled extensively was asking for 20 euros deposit for the remote control.... how petty can you get. Staff ranged from very pleasant and helpful to hostile and rude. No mention on any website about the building work taking place next door, a real treat been woken at 7.30 by drilling when we were still up at 4.00waiting for the group of men above us deciding when they were going to shut up and allow everyone to sleep. The most annoying thing was that time care and a little effort could have made all the difference to the hotel, nobody seemed to care.

<Content>Worst 2 nights of my life Booked weeks in advance to stay in Quentin Arrive Hotelas it was close to the train station, but the day before we were supposed to go to Amsterdam they sent me an e-mail saying that hotel was being renovated and they had transferred us to the Quentin Engeland so if I hadn't checked my e-mails the night before, we would have arrived at the wrong hotel - they had my phone number but it must cost too much to phone customers?? So we went to Quentin Engeland and well lucky us, turns out the renovations were happening there!?! so we had booked a double room online, and they gave us a dungeon! down in the cellar, two single beds that are so light that if you move slightly the mattress slides away from the wall. There was no way to turn on the tv and nobody told us that you had to pay to get the remote control!! Our view from the window was at ground level, a kindof cubby-hole where it looked like a homeless person sleeps, there were a lot of cigarette butts, and outside of the cubby-hole the rubbish bins were such a pretty sight. The window wouldn't lock so we jammed something in it so nobody could get in. It was extremely noisy, people above us mainly. And at 7am the builders started with their noisy drills etc. I reccommend this place to nobody. Not sure about the non-dungeon rooms, they're probably fine! If you stay here, specify that you do not want a cellar room!!

<Content>Great loaction, great hotel! I can't beleive that alot of these other reviews were written about the same hotel! I went away with a large group of friends (18 of us aged 18 to 27) and have to say was really worried after reading the reviews. When we got there we were 3 hours early for check in and the staff were very pleasant and gave us some rooms to store our bags in. There was a huge variety in room size in the hotel, all the twin/double rooms were ample size, even for two high maintance girls! My room was on the third floor, which did involve alot of steps and there was no lifts but this was fine for urs, we had a lovely big window with a huge window ledge/seat that was great to look out on the street. Some of the other rooms were three times the size of this and had huuuuge balconies. We had no sinlge rooms but I did see one when it was being cleaned and it was TINY so wouldn't recommend gettin a single room there, it had no window.The double/twin rooms were all well sized, the bathrooms were clean adequate and our room was cleaned everday, the staff were very friendly and the cleaners wouldnt frce you otu by a certain time etc etcIf you are looking for a centrally located base to explore the city and day and night then I would highly recommend this hotel,the rooms are clean and reasonably to very generously sized!I would defintly go here again, had the most amazing holiday ever :)

<Content>poor service and hidden costs On arrival, we were greeted by a very rude receptionist who was not willing to provide any level of customer service. When we booked this hotel 2 months ago, there was no mention of a 5% fee for paying for the accommodation and thus were obliged to pay upfront for three day accommodation in cash on a Friday night at 11pm!!! My pal had to pay the credit card fee and was only informed after paying that, there was a cash machine around the block. All in all the hospitality was non-existent as the sheets in the room were only changed once, and the bathroom never cleaned during my stay. I raised a complaint with the manager who then offered a refund of the credit card charge if we settled the full amount in cash and then await a refund on the credit card within the next 10 days!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone, as there are much better hotels nearer to the city centre for the same price as we found in our search for alternatives.

<Content>Low Budget room was awful Would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. Very tiny rooms, paper thin walls and the staff high on dope in middle of night. No towels left, no toilet paper - however room was cleaned every day. Although it was a budget room, i would still have expected more for what we paid, it wasnt that cheap after all. Ideal for a stoner or someone passing through for a night, but would not recommend any longer. Has the smallest window I have ever seen which let in no air at all.

<Content>One could do a lot better Reasons why this hotel was a total disappointment:1. The twin room was too small for comfort and each twin-bed is probably a third of the size of a single bed. 2. The hall smells awful -- sometimes with strong cleaning chemicals, other times just a disgusting smell. 3. We stayed for 3 nights and our room was only cleaned once. 4. No safe storage even at reception.5. 5% surcharge for credit card, which was not advertised on booking.

<Content>Not a great hotel We stayed 3 nights in this hotel and the experience was not a good one at all. The hotel staff are unhelpful and unfriendly. When we arrived they put us in the Garden Room - which is little more than a tool shed outside the back of the hotel. The room was tiny, musty, and did not run on the hotel's water supply, but rather on a noisy pump that turned itself on each time any water was used. We immediately requested another room (I have asthma and could not breathe in this 'room'). We were told there were no other available rooms. We went out and returned later to the room. Again, I could not breathe, so we went back to reception (another person was on the desk) and they initially told us there were no other rooms available. My husband was a bit angry and pointed out that this was nothing more than a tool shed. I added that if they couldn't find us another room they should find us another hotel. Suddenly, they had an available room! This room was much better, but it had no ammenities. The room was not cleaned daily, the walls and carpets were filthy and the television did not work. However, the beds were very comfortable.Again, I stress that the staff were non-responsive to the point of being rude. They made me feel that I was interferring in their job and the receptionist spoke to me only when she was finished on her computer work. I felt like an intruder in this hotel. On the good side, it is in an excellent location.

<Content>Good for a cheap hotel - and I've seen a few! My partner and I stayed at the Quentin England for two nights on our first trip to Amsterdam earlier this year. I booked the hotel because it was the cheapest I could find (we had a very tight budget) that was still a private double room.We rented bikes when we arrived and found the hotel pleasantly easy to find once we reached the Leidseplein because it was on an unusually shaped street and we had a handy map. There was good facilities to lock our bikes to, but that's certainly not uncommon and they were pretty 'busy' or full despite it being off season. Having read these reviews we were nervous as to what we would find but the check in was smooth and easy and then we were told our room would be - on the fourth floor. The stairs were wide and easy for the first 3 flights (with an attractive stained glass window) then the final climb up typical ankle-breaking Amsterdam stairs. Our room was actually a twin room which was mildly annoying but it took no effort to scooch them together. There was nothing much else in the room which was small indeed without much headroom, but the wetroom shower and toilet attached was clean and quite spacy (ask for towels at the DESK). We had a smoking room which meant an open window! A little one but fine, although it flapped in the wind (it was VERY windy) and banged in the night. In the morning we awoke to a strange squeaking noise and looked across the road to find people moving in opposite and wheeling all manner of objects from plants to matresses into the top floor window with a mechanised pulley system. To many this might have been a major problem but we found it fascinating seeing this part of local life.The room was rather hot (especially after climbing all those stairs!) but since it was cold outside the warmth was welcome. May be a different story in the summer though. Everything was perfectly clean. Our rooms were cleaned while we were out the second day and everything was just as we had left it (aside from the sheets and things they usually move). The location of the hotel was the best part.The room was perfect for what we wanted and needed - a bed for two nights at a price we could afford. We would stay at the Quentin England again but we're going to Amsterdam again next month and we found a cheaper hotel in the same great location. So shop around, but for a cheap hotel it was absolutely fine. I have had far dirtier, messier and more expensive rooms in London.

<Content>Unresponsive staff, loud, smoky I just spent 8 nights at the Quentin England and was very disappointed. The continental breakfast at the hotel is very sparse and they frequently ran out of food (such as bread) less than halfway through the breakfast time. The front desk staff was rude, cold and unresponsive to problems including leaks and windows that wouldn't close. The hotel is quite smoky and most of the hotel workers smoke in the lobby. The last two nights I was there the group staying next door came back at 3am woke us up by being falling while coming up the stairs, screaming, smoking and carrying on for more than an hour. Room phones rarely work so calling the front desk was not an available option. Staircases are particularly steep and rickety. The luggage storage room flooded while we were there and that staff seemed reluctant to attempt to do anything to remedy the problem. The hotel felt like a youth hostel only for double the price. The Owl Hotel down the street although a bit more expensive would be a much better option.

<Content>Unpleasant "stay" I stayed here one night in July 2007. When I checked in I was in a hurry so I just put my bags on my bed, took a quick shower and ran off to meet a friend. I spent the rest of the day and evening outside and returned to the hotel at around 2 am. Went into my room and noticed some sort of small, black bugs crawling on the walls around my bed and on the bed as well. I am a chicken and freaked out a bit, so I packed my things and left my room in the middle of the night! I was catching a plane at 10:30 am the next morning, so I ended up sitting in the lobby until 4:30 am and then walked to the train station. The bugs were disgusting and the room was small with a strange, unpleasant smell. TV didn't work and the walls were paper thin. I had a single room on the top floor with shared bathroom/shower. I really wish I had chosen another hotel, and I would have liked to stay in another area too. If I had only discovered Tripadvisor before going... I would never ever stay at this hotel again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Really not a nice place to stay Just don't do it. 拢60 a night to stay in someone's loft is way OTT. Our room was pretty 'unclean' with marks and stains on the walls and carpet. We couldn't operate the TV as the hotel had removed the buttons, you have to ask for the remote at reception and leave a 20 Euro deposit - [--]?Our hot tap didn't work at all and the cold one ony periodically, upon bringing this to the attention of the front desk staff I was greeted with non-plussed expressions and was fobbed off with a bottle of cold water!I wouldn't stay here again, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, unless of course they asked me to recommend an over-priced, under-maintained, filthy flea pit in which to spend a few uncomfortable nights.In summary - don't stay here, find somewhere else.

<Content>not happy, not happy at all We hired two NON budget double rooms and a single and ended up in the loft, via the ladder steps, in twin rooms that are clearly the preserve of dunken stag/hen do's normally. If you don't mind taps that don't work, rooms with no windows and dry vommit on the curtains then this is the place for you. Taking away the buttons off the TV and then wanting 20 euro's deposit for the remote is pushing it a bit though. We were particuarly impressed with the dry blood on the wall of the single room too, nice welcoming touch!The location is its only saving grace, meaning you can escape the noise when you've had enough.... that's it!

<Content>OK...... For a night My friend and I stayed here for one night on the 30th January. Another friend of ours booked it for us on the spur of the moment just the evening before has we had a hiccup with our previous accommodation plans so I only got to read the reviews a matter of hours before leaving for Amsterdam. As some of the reviews are quite scary I did wonder what we were letting ourselves in for. We arrived from London Stansted quite early and our room wasn鈥檛 ready but the hotel has a secure baggage room where we could leave our bags. As check-in wasn鈥檛 until 14.00 we went out for the day, in fact we jumped on a bus and went to the very pretty seaside town of Volendam. On returning, we were checked in by a rather 鈥渟chool mistress type鈥?of woman who was devoid of a smile and humour. Our room was on the ground floor (No 24) behind the reception so at least we didn鈥檛 have to worry about all the steep narrow stairs to the upper floors or down to the dingy basement rooms so at this point I thought we had a result. Our room was small with the two twin beds, which were pushed together like a double taking up most of the room. The carpet was dirty as was the curtains but at least we had a window which looked out onto the back yard. The main light fitting was hanging from the ceiling, the headboard of the bed had a piece broken off of it and the plain wallpaper was grubby with numerous scuff marks on it. The furniture was old and tired. The small toilet/shower room was clean but the cold tap knob on the tiny sink was broken as was the shower rail supporting the shower head. However, the water was piping hot and the water pressure was good. One clean towel was provided each and soap was provided using a dispenser on the wall. On a plus note, the bed linen and pillows were clean and the mattresses were comfortable which I guess is the most important point. The room had a T.V. but you had to leave a 20 Euro deposit for the remote, we didn鈥檛 bother. Other than that, there鈥檚 not much else to mention about the room..... Until later that is. My mates and I are English Ajax supporters and were in Amsterdam for the Ajax v PSV match that evening. After the match, we usually finish the night off in the bars of the Leidseplein area. On returning to the hotel at around 1am we turned into bed and it wasn鈥檛 long before I realised this room wasn鈥檛 such a good idea after all. Because the room was just behind the reception and indeed the entrance all you could hear was the banging of the front door and the 鈥渃lump clump鈥?of people walking up and down on the wooden floor. I鈥檓 sure everyone must have been wearing clogs!! So I hardly got any sleep which is a bit tough when you have got to be up at 6am for the first flight back to London. If we were to use this hotel again, I would ask for a room on the first floor. We paid 45 Euro鈥檚 for the night which worked out at around 拢17 each which despite the hotels shortcomings wasn鈥檛 bad value. At the end of the day it is just somewhere to get your head down for a few hours. The hotels biggest plus point is its location. It is right on the doorstep of the Leidseplein area with its array of bars and restaurants plus the Holland casino if you fancy a flutter. Here鈥檚 a tip, if you are staying at the Quentin England or any other hotel in the Leidseplein area and are coming from Schiphol airport, don鈥檛 bother with the train to Centraal station and then a tram, simply catch the 370 express bus outside the airport terminal. The bus is fast and is cheaper than taking a train and tram and stops right in the Leidseplein. It costs just 3.40 Euro鈥檚. The Quentin England is a cheap and cheerful hotel and if needed, we would probably use it again but there are many other hotels in the same street and surrounding area. Hope this review has been helpful.

<Content>Thank God for Quentin England Without the experience of staying at the 'Quentin' I wouldn't have a clue as to what to expect if I ever had the misfortune to end up in prison. Now I do and I know it's not for me. This hotel has saved me from ever embarking on a life of crime because I couldn't hack doing porridge if it's anything like my stay at the 'Quentin'. Life in the 'Quentin' is tough, very tough, especially if you happen to be booked into one of it's famous basement rooms by an idiotic / masochistic friend who should know better. There is no light, no air, no space, absolutely no security (if you happen to have the room with the vista of the bins), although the hotel can boast a rat infestation and a rather charming jackson pollock-esque homage in room 6 that someone has painted in what appears to be dried blood. 2 of the basement rooms are so oppressively hot it is impossible stay in them for long periods without beginning to look like characters jettisoned from an episode of 'it aint half hot mum'. Strangely like prison you become accustomed to the ways of the 'Quentin' and it starts to grow on you like impetigo (which you stand a good chance of catching whilst on your stay at 'Quentin' just like a pathogenic Brucie Bonus) and you become institutionalised to the point where you become wary of hotels that are safe, clean and have more on the room service menu than a Twix (that's not a joke!).I cannot stress enough how stale this hotel is; if it were a footballer it would be Titus Bramble, if it were a cheese it would be quark, if it were a country it would be Belgium; it is quite possibly the worst hotel in the world...ever!

<Content>Had A Nightmare Stay I booked a twin budget room with own toilet and shower, on arrival wechecked in and were told our room was probably not one of the best but it did say in the small print it could be in the basement without a window, so the alarm bells started to ring, we went into the room (which to us was only what I can describe as storage room for cleaning equipment), there was no ventilation whatsoever and it smelt very fusty, I suffer from Asthma and straight away could feel my chest tightening, we went back to reception and asked politely to be moved we would be willing to pay more for a better room. We were told there were no rooms available as there was a conference on, but people would be checking out tomorrow and we could then move. After a terrible night sleep we found a note under the door that said sorry we are unable to move you, there are no free rooms. This was very dissapointing to us, as we had come to sightsee but when youget no sleep, you do not feel like doing much the next day. We asked the receptionist again if there was anything, she was helpful and understood out plight she tried to book us in to the central hotel and also found an atic room with a skylight but we had to share facilities, we chose this option because at least we had a window to open and let some air in, the receptionist said we could also have a discount difference between bathroom and no bathroom. On the day of the departure there was a different receptionist and said we would not get any discount, when we told him the other receptionist said we could he rang her and spoke to her and More or less called me liar when she said she could not remember promising me a discount, he would not budge with this and to be honest was patronising, he said we should pay more because we have been moved to a room with a window!!! He said you paid for a low budget room and it does say may not have window and could be in basement, but I would never think that it would not have any ventilation whatsover, surely it was a human right to expect air, we left the hotel very annoyed and frustrated surely that is not a good way to let a customer leave. I told him I had been recommended by a work colleague, i would in a very large organisation, and I would not be recommending this hotel to anyone else and neither will my colleague when I tell her. I cannot believe that as a good will gesture he would not at least give us the difference of the room rates, to be honest it was not the money but the principle. Very dissapointed spolit one day of a three night stay. On a slightly more positive note, it was in a great location, and we looked in other rooms which seemed nice, but please look at small print and personally I would not book a low budget room but if you do state when booking must have a window.

<Content>Avoid Avoid Please please do yourself a favour.Do not give this hotel your hard earned money.The rooms are like 1* dormatries  I came away with flea bites too.I have since looked at past reviews and this has been highlighted by other guests.It is not so cheap anyway! plenty of decent 3* rooms in A'dam for 80 Euros.Ps some of the rooms do not have windows either...but they will not tell you that at reception or in fact on the website.Staff were unhelpful  rude  would not change to room with a window without additional payment,even though my booking made no reference to such.For a balanced review I would say hotel is in a quiet street.

<Content>Great location After reading some pretty horrific reviews about this Hotel before we left, i was not expecting anything wonderful. The place has been renovated and was very nice and comfortable for us for the three nights we were there. Brekkie is nothing special but the food in Amsterdam is nothing special. The location is great, it is at the bottom of the main strip and we found it easy to get out and about. The staff were pretty good too especially the young Asian guy who was on reception from time to time. I would consider staying here again.

<Content>OK for a one night stay Book directly on quentin hotels website for the cheapest rates...I think this hotel (or hostel) is probably OK based on what you pay for it in a city like AMS...if you pay any more than 40E, you will be most dissapointed! The rooms are about the size of a large walk in closet, stained carpets, narrow long staircases, rude and ignorant staff, but....great location (near all museums, and Liedesplein)...If you have more than a day to spend in AMS and plan on staying in your room for longer than 3-4 hours, look elsewhere...I think this is nothing more than a private hostel with shared restrooms, and it fits the bill.

<Content>The worst Hotel in the world ever Without a doubt the worst place I have ever stayed. The camp guards at Auschwitz could have taught the receptionist about hospitality. Tiny, tiny rooms with no windows, receptionist laughing at you when she sees the room you鈥檙e booked into. Extra 5% charge for paying by credit card. Book a double - you get given a twin - and told if you don't like it you can leave but they will still charge it to the credit card you RESERVED the room with. Avoid this place like the plague, sleep on the street, sleep in central station, man sleep with the hookers but don't, don鈥檛 what ever you do, stay at this glorified doss house.

<Content>Managed expectations and I got a Good Price at an Adequate Hotel Average 2 star hotel. No lift. Quiet street. Relatively clean. Convenient to public transportation (Liedseplein 鈥?3 blocks). Close to museums (Rijkmuseum  Van Gogh). This was my first trip to Amsterdam. From the outside, this hotel looked about on par with others we passed. All looked small (i.e. narrow building with steep steps). Breakfast was continental and adequate as well as adequately supplied (7 euro per person). Paid 70 Euro per night for 2 people (booked through www.easytobook.com.)Room 301 - Shower, sink  toilet were very small  shower was only separated by the shower curtain so the entire floor got wet when the shower ran. Only one person could fit in the bathroom at a time. However, based on the limited space throughout Amsterdam, this may be a routine occurrence. This isn鈥檛 meant as a criticism, only an adjustment from what you would expect in a US hotel. There was sufficient water pressure, sufficient hot water, and the water temp didn鈥檛 fluctuate dramatically. Leidseplein (3 blocks from hotel) is a public transportation crossroad so easy access to transport all over. Leidseplein also has lots of dining options and an active night life.The Bad: Had to pay full bill at check-in.Housekeeping got the bed half made then stopped and didn鈥檛 re-supply towels. (No real problem except it meant an round trip to the lobby.)TV had no volume knob/buttons and to get a remote, there was a 25 Euro deposit (fully refunded).Downside: No elevator. Steep stairs and if you pack heavy, or end up in room 300, it鈥檚 not convenient. The last 10 steps between floor 2 and 3 (formerly the attic) is almost a ladder (i.e. very steep). Bathroom (Shower/Sink/Toilet combination) was, shall I say, interesting. Good Value for the money. My hotel selection criteria are 1) safe, 2) clean, 3) convenient then I temper that against price. I would stay again. That said, I would probably elect to stay at a different hotel just to be able to contrast between the two.

<Content>OK! Check your room spec in advance if you can! We were given a double room on the top floor. Beware, the last few stairs to this area are hazardous - this isn't specific to this hotel, as frequent visitors to Amsterdam will know it's normal in tall buildings for the stairs to be steep. The room itself was clean, but had a wet-room rather than a bathroom. So the floor remains wet after showers... not sure this was made clear when booking but it's ok if you're close to the person you're sharing with I guess. It was really hot, and the window in room 302 is shared with the room next door so consequently it is boiling hot. Reception didn't have fans, or a limited number, but seemed not particularly bothered about helping. This isn't wholly true, the young man on reception during the afternoon was far more helpful than the disagreeable young woman who was more concerned about the fact that she didn't have a fan. Customer service doesn't register with this hotel, but for the price you can kind of understand that. In all, I would recommend but make sure that you have facilities in your room. We walked past some single rooms that had the doors open and they looked about as big as a garden shed without windows.

<Content>Don't stay here!!! Flea and noisy. Quentin England Hotel - worst hotel! - It has flea and bit me 8 places on my legs. I changed a room, and 2am I found the flea on my sheet! It is not an isolated incident! - It has phone in room, but you can not dial outside. - It has TV, only that it doesn't work. - It has shower, but no lights in there. And every time after you use it, the pipe makes really loud noise. - It has maid service, however, they simplely pour my coffee into face wash sink and leave the brown fluide drying on the white tile. - It has door, only that it does not isolate any noise. If your neighbour makes a turn in his bed, you can hear it! I was waken every 5 to 10 minutes by the slapping door from guests entering into their room, or the front desk people working for night shift doing clean-ups. - It is really hot, regardless having windows or not. Leaving windows open, you can sleep; closing it, too hot to sleep, and still noisy. And funniest thing is, you are prisoned yourselves there because they collect all the cost up front. This is a 2-star hotel. No matter how competitive the rates are, I would expect a standard like 2-star hotel. I comment to the front desk, they should send a staff or investigator to spend a night there and he will know! The female staffs all look grumpy. They obviously hate their jobs. It must be tough working there. The hotel is a crap, so customers are angry. They have to deal with the ugly problems everyday, even changing a room will not help much. I usually check tripAdvisor before booking the hotel, but I was too busy with my work and forgot to check this time, so I made a mistake booking for this one. The location is great. There are many other good hotels on that street: Leids Square hotel, Owl hotel, ... I would highly recommend Leids Square hotel.

<Content>For the money, you can't beat the convenience. I travel to Amsterdam at least once each year, and I've stayed at the Quentin England on 2 occasions. I've stayed at hotels in Amsterdam that were supposed to be 3 and 4 star facilities that turned out to be more like 2 star hotels. I have also rented apartments and houses in Amsterdam which were very nice (beautiful, in fact), but not close to the center of town. Having said that, for the money, I don't think you can do much better than the Quentin England. If you're looking for an inexpensive, clean, quiet hotel near the center of town, your options are limited. I wouldn't want to be stuck in one of the basement rooms at the England during the summer months, but they're acceptable when air conditioning is not needed. I've stayed at better in Amsterdam, and I've stayed at worse, but no place I've stayed at in Amsterdam beats the England's location. It's quiet, but amazingly close to everything, unlike many places that I've stayed at, which are a tram ride (or two) away from everything. I wouldn't want to be stuck in one of the basement rooms during the summer months, but they're acceptable when air conditioning is not needed. I love the excitement of the city, but I like being able to come home to a room on a quiet street. I'll be staying at the England on my next trip to Amsterdam in November, because this time around, I want to be near everything. I rented a beautiful house last year, but I spent alot of time on trams getting back and forth! ...It's a trade-off!

<Content>Not quiet or spacious This hotel is very centrally located and is very affordable, so I chose it over many others for a two-night business stay in June. But beware! I stayed in a single room with shower and although the shower/ loo was very nice, the single room is very small (the size of the single bed with extra room only to walk past it on one side) and has *no windows* or ventilation of any kind. I did not sleep at all in this room on a warm night in June.There was nowhere to hang my clothes (one clothes hanger, but the bar to hang it on had been removed), no instructions in the room on what do to in case of fire (and no escape, I later noticed, except for the main staircase to the lobby), and the phone did not work. Also, when you arrive, there is a there is 5% surcharge added to the bill for those paying with a credit card, which is ridiculous. The central staircase is noisy and the walls are very thin. 25E deposit required, I discovered at the desk, for use of television remote control.On my second day I asked to move to a room with a window and was given a single room on the top floor, which had a skylight that opened. Here there was some air and I was able to sleep a bit, but there was still nowhere to hang my clothes, no instructions on how to use anything or to call out (this phone also didn't work) or get out in case of fire. There wasn't even a notice telling you how to call reception. Only one towel in this room (two handtowels and no bath towel in the previous room) and no hairdryer, etc.This hotel was convenient in its location, but my stay here definitely interfered with my work. Recommended only for travellers who want to save money and for whom sleep is not a priority.

<Content>Dirty and Depressing Just arrived home from the quentin england. NOT a good experience, checked into the hotel and had to pay up front for the two nights before even seeing our room, Very strange, Ive never had to do this before. When I asked why, the receptionist rudely said she didnt know and that it was their policy. Now I know why! walked into the room and it was at top floor in the rafters of the building and was about 7ft x7ft with not enough room to stand up in let alone sit up in bed due to the sloping walls. Dark , dank and dirty with a window no bigger than a shoe box. I wanted to cry.When we went down to reception and stated that we werent satisfied with the room, she huffed and said we could change rooms, then showed us an equally unsatisfactory room in the basement. It was tiny, dirty and dark with no window and i cant imagine staying anywhere more depressing. Apparently that was all that was left. We then said we would like our money back and that we wished to check into another hotel. WE were told this wasnt possible and then she offered to show us the garden room. This consisted of a converted shed out the back of a messy courtyard. It was damp and totally unsuitable but we settled for this as our only choice other than losing our money and forking out for another hotel. On the second night i realised the towels had been taken but not replaced, so I phoned down to reception and explained. He snapped that I could come and get them if I wanted them! I've never experienced such rudeness at a hotel. The whole room filled up with steam every time I had a shower, The carpet was filthy, there was no way I would walk on it with bare feet for fear of catching something, Staff made me feel unwelcome. At night the paper thin walls meant you could hear people coming in and out talking all night. after two nights here I could'nt wait to pack my bags and get out of that hell hole.We would have been better off in a squat house!I realise that the Quentin England is only 2 star but, Ive stayed in better youth hostels than this. A 2 star hotel should at least be clean and well maintained, and it doesn't cost anything for friendly staff. thoroughly disapointed. PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE!

<Content>Good experience for us Having just returned from a long weekend in Amsterdam, and after reading the poor reviews, my wife and I were expecting a Fawlty Towers senario, but seriously we were pleasantly suprised by this so called budget accomodation.We stayed in a 2nd floor double room that was spacious, clean and had a comfy bed, the bathroom was also clean with a good shower and towels were changed daily.As for location, you cannot get too much closer to the Bars  Restaurants of the Liedsepslein (no more than a 3-4 minute walk). This was our 3rd visit to Amsterdam and definately not the worst hotel we have stayed in, all of which were in the area of the beautiful Vondelpark  Liedseplein.The staff were friendly and helpful so in our opinion if you are looking for a budget hotel this is a good choice, give it a try.

<Content>Terrible, Dirty, Small, This hotel has to be the worst I`ve ever stayed in. Very small, nowhere to hang or put clothes, stairs like ladders, mold on walls, no kettle, no bar, no draws, two hand towels for two large men, dirty tissues under the bed, cold and dusty but then we were upgraded to a basement room, all of the above but with no windows.

<Content>It worked for us! Reading the other reviews, I'm a bit perplexed. The staff were incredibly helpful (the receptionist let us check in three hours early)! Since my girlfriend and I didn't spend that much time in the room, the value and location was worth the stay. The room was clean, modestly furnished and had a great view. If you don't plan on staying in your hotel room for a prolonged period of time, then I would recommend this hotel. Vondel Park is only two minutes away - a big plus!!

<Content>Like a prison cell The only thing going for this hotel is its location. Very unfriendly staff, not particularly helpful. They did not make us feel welcome at all. The room was little more than a cell in the basement. The window was tiny, we had to constantly keep the lights on as it was too dark with them off.The wardrobe (if you can call it that) was not big enough for 1 person let alone 2. 2 coat hangers!!! It had a tiny hanging space. We ended up hanging our clothes up around the room.The room was fairly clean on arrival, however, the towels (we got 2) were not changed until we had been in the room for 3 days. We were given 2 toilet rolls and no more.On the positive side, the bathroom was spot on, with a powerful flush toilet and a power shower.Amsterdam itself was FANTASTIC and more than made up for the disappointing accomodation.However, if you can avoid being given the basement rooms, it is an adequate hotel for an adequate price. And as I mentioned, the location is superb. Literally 5 minutes away from the centre, but quiet at night. And the lack of light meant we slept in in the mornings!

<Content>Ok, Near Bars and Restaurants I stayed in the Quentin Engalnd between the 23-26 March and found my stay in the hotel enjoyable. If you are looking for a base to head out from then this hotel is ideal, I'm not gonna put you under any illusions that this is nearly one of the best hotels i have stayed in but it is far from the worst. The rooms are quite small and the bathroom is also quite small but both were clean.A place which is close and a must do is Hard Rock Cafe the food is reasonable and surprisingly so to was the drinks, also for any lads Teasers Bar is a must if any of you have seen Coyote Ugly then this place is like that but better.All in all i would rate The Quentin England as an ok hotel and the 2 star rating is about right.

<Content>Wish I had read the reviews! Superbly situated close to the Liedesplien square where you can find hundreds of restaurants and bars. The street (Roemmer Visscherstraat) is attractive but surprisingly noisy at night. We were initially given a small, windowless, room in the basement. We asked to be moved on the second day and the friendly and very helpful staff obliged. We ended up in an equally small room above the entrance with a tiny shower room/toilet but we did have a window. The walls were thin, staircase steep and creaky, fairly clean and fine for the budget traveller.Would I stay there again? Hmmmm, possibly look elsewhere I think.

<Content>Noisy, bad service, expensive. We just returned from Amsterdam (Oct 2005) and here is our experience with The Quentin England Hotel.- On arrival we have been asked to pay in advance our stay. There was the first surprise: if you pay by a credit card, they charge you 5% extra! (no mention on the website, reservation receipt or anywhere else). No debit cards are accepted and if you don't have the cash for the entire stay with you, tough luck.- The lady on the reception (on the day we checked in) was not helpful and on occasions even rude. (If you ever watched the Little Britain show, it is the computer says no scenario).- The room and the toilet were not very clean.- The room was small, with very basic equipment, TV was not working well (not that we wanted to use it, but still), the shower is practically non-existent; the pillows are ultra-soft in case this makes a difference to you.- The hotel is extremely noisy, you can hear people talk or walk in other rooms/floors. This becomes a nightmare when you want to sleep as you are constantly awakened by people who pass by or talk.- The hotel is not a good value; the price we paid was very close to the much better Novotel hotel (although the location was not)- The location of Quentin England hotel is good, very close to where restaurants and cafes are.

<Content>Stay away from this one!!! The front desk is friendly enough. Paid in advance which I thought was weird as I have not done this before in all of my travels worldwide. That should have been the first clue.Had a single room. Offered one in the first floor. Right off the main hallway, no windows and very small. The other was in the basement (#5). At least had a window with no screen so bugs flew and crawled in. Not much view as it was ground level and the ground below a deck of sorts. Never cleaned the room except to tidy up and place new towel. Well the new towel only lasted one day as the help quit right in front of my eyes. Had to ask for new towel before I retired for the night. The shower floor floods as the drain works slowly. Fungus Heaven. Very noisy because it was close to the lockers.Just find another place and save yourself a hassle.

<Content>simple clean hotel - great location We have just come back from Amsterdam and was pleasantly suprised with the Quentin England Hotel. The rooms are basic but clean and we were pleased to have MTV on the TV!! The location was great and only a few mins walk away from all the bars and restuarants in leidseplein. We also found it easy and simple to find from the airport by catching the train to Central Station then either line 1, 2 or 5 for the tram to Leidseplein. The street that the hotel is situated on is nice and quiet so getting a good night sleep was always possible. The staff were always friendly, helpful and knowledgeable of the area.Our room was situated on the top floor which was quite a trek up the very steep flights of stairs!! Therefore, wouldnt recommend this for anyone who struggles with mobility. Our room didnt have a safe to put any valuables in which worried me slightly although we experinced no problems through not having a safe. Overall i was extremely pleased with our choice of hotel. We went to amsterdam for the sight seeing in the day and the nightlife and would recomend it to anybody who like us simply wants a base to put their belongings and have a clean room to sleep in.

<Content>Never Ever Use This Hotel-Its Total Rubbish This hotel is rubbish! I have stayed in lots of hotels in Amsterdam over the years  this was by far the worse!I had to pay for room in Advance as soon as i arrived. Then was told there would be a charge for using my credit card! reception looked quite clean thoughGot to room on 3rd froor, opened door  [--] (sorry to swear but i couldnt beleive it). The room was what i can only describe as a closet. I think it was a store room for mops/cleaning products before being converted to a so called bedroom! THERE WAS NOT EVEN A WINDOW. I DIDNT THINK TO ASK FOR A ROOM WITH A WINDOW IN ADVANCE-SILLY ME!!! Its not much fun not knowing what to wear before leaving your room!There was an on-suite which i could barely fit into of about 2ft sq. My towels or bedsheets were NEVER changed during my whole stay! It was like i had been forgotten about  stuffed in a cupboard!My last words will be-NEVER EVER SYAy HERE IF YOU ARE A SINGLE TRAVELLER.

<Content>Nice Hotel My fiance and I stayed at the Quentin England Hotel,Amsterdam in June 1998 and June 2002,and to be honest,while it is a small hotel it is very clean and in an ideal location for exploring Amsterdam.While the rooms are abit on the small side,and the stairs up to them are quite steep(this is a feature of alot of Dutch buildings,so I am told by my Dutch brother-in-law),the hotel is a good base for exploring Amsterdam and the hotel is not expensive.Disadvantage of the hotel - staff could be more friendly.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised I stayed here for 1 night on 25 April 2005 and had read some bad reviews of it on this site. The hotel was nicer than the 3* one I stayed in later. Its in a lovely quiet tree-lined street, near the park and the Film museum Its only small, but my room was lovely, with a wonderful, bed nice bathroom and good efficient shower. Everything seemed clean bright and efficient, and the staff very nice. I'd be very happy to stay there again

<Content>Bad experience We were booked here for a week but had to check out after only three nights. Rooms are very small...but that wasn't the problem: it was the noise and the smoke. Our room was on the second floor, at the top of the stairs, and we could hear everybody drinking and talking in the lobby until 2 or 3 a.m. each night. Plus, even though the room was non-smoking the smoke wafted up from the lobby and right into our room. The people at the front desk were apologetic and nice about the situation, but it didn't solve the problems with the room. With plenty of other places to stay in Amsterdam, we won't be back to this one.

<Content>Quentin England OK Hotel was fine for those who don't spend a lot of time in it and only use it as a base. Good central location, clean and staff very courteous and helpful. Breakfast is good value - if you like a continental breakfast - at only 7 euros per head, quite competitive. It's stretching it a bit to advertise that the hotel has a bar, all it consists of is a few cans of beer and some miniatures behind the reception desk! Also the walls between rooms are a bit thin and we could hear the TV (and other interesting noises!) from the room next door! But all in all for the price this was fine. I would go there again.

<Content>Have stay in beter. Its in a good area of Amsterdam and just a 10min walk from the main drinking area and the shops but thats about it. Rooms are small. TV in room is ok but dont pick up all channels. Radio in my room had poor signal. Bathroom was ok I guess. Breakfast well never got my breakfast there as there is not enough tables for the rooms and most had to queue for there breakfast if you was late getting up. Best just to take room only as there is planty eating places in the area. My sisters room was worse than mine as she could here people coming in and going in there rooms or going upstairs to there rooms late at night. Staff did try to be very helpful. I only stayed there 3 night in july 2003 but found that was long enough. I have been to Amsterdam before but found this hotel to ber ok if you just staying overnight.

<Content>Prisoners live in better conditions I stayed at the Quentin Hotel August '04 and and found the living conditions to be worse that what most 3rd world countries experience. Upon arrival the hotel looked quite well kept on the outside and even in the reception area I thought that the hotel looked ok for a 2 star rated hotel. The chap at reception was ok. He gave directions to my room. I immediately almost smashed my neck on the stairs down to the basement. It would have been easier to walk down them using stilts and having drunk 10 pints of the strongest Dutch beer. I arrived at the 1st room in the basement had had to check that I hadn't actually arrived at a cleaners store room! I opened that door and was greeted with the foisty stench off the brick work within the room and sheer black darkness. I struggled to locate a light switch and could not believe my eyes when I switched the light on. The room was less than 1/2 the size of standard prison cell. The bathroom was filthy and there was a constant sound of what I can only assume to be a boiler 'ticking' over, hour after hour. The single bed was up against a filthy wall nicelyl decorated with squashed insects. For light you are presented with what doesn't even equate to a skylight. There 'window' was approx. a sq. foot in size and opened about 1 inch. No storage space at all for suits, shirts, etc. The window is on the street level and so you can always hear folks passing by at all hours. Worse again are those that sit on the chair outside. My window was immediately under the chair outside and I lost count of the number of times I freaked out at the shuffling of shoes, drunks, etc. Not a good place to stay for those of a nervous disposition. Only way to get over the awful conditions is to drink at least 16 cans of lager from the reception and collpase in a heap somewhere. Little point talking about the food as this was awful too. Room was full of dead spiders, especially around the window area and they only served to block the odd ray of light that managed to squeeze it's way off the street! Lack of towels and had to ask for fresh ones taht seemed as thought they has alreay been used. The worst place I have ever stayed in and would not, under any circumstances recommend staying here or in one of its underground 'war shelters' ever. Sleep on the streets, in a prison cell (more room and far better food) or nearby Vondel Park would be my recommendation here.

<Content>A poor value in a competitive area I stayed at this hotel in the summer of 2002, and my experience very much resembled those of the reviewers with the more nightmarish scenarios. I reserved a double room months in advance, only to arrive and find that they had given us a twin room; when I asked for what we had reserved, they simply responded that they didn't have any left. The room itself was actually a converted garden shed, with a dirty bathroom. The breakfasts were the worst that I have had in Amsterdam in many stays, with reconstituted orange juice, canned ham, tasteless cheese -- truly unappetizing food. The management alternated between being clueless and rude, for instance, when they 'forgot' to give us towels every day of our stay, so that we had to ask for them as soon as we noticed that we didn't have any. There are many good hotels on the Roemer Visscherstraat, such as the Hestia or the Sipermann; there is no reason to stay in such an unpleasant place as the Hotel Quentin England.

<Content>STAY AWAY!!! 4 of us stayed at this hotel in July 2004 and had booked ot up months in advance. on arrival, 2 of us were told that the only room available was in the basement. This room was worse than a prison cell. no windows, very hot and tiny. we eventually got moved on our 3rd night after being told the hotel was full. The breakfast was appalling. I paid cash, in full for this pleasure only to arrive home and find that they've charged my credit card for 2 nights stay. they won't return my calls, e-mails or letters. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!

<Content>A No no to Quentin England. Having arrived after a long days work, i was looking forward to my bed. The outside is ok, so not disappointed yet. Walked in and the carpet and walls are looking grubby. Still no worries, as all i want is a clean room and bed. Got to the first room in the basement - filthy, airless. A true sweat box, like in the movies in a 3rd world Country. Had to reject this one.2nd Room, there was mould on the walls and was so filthy. Reject no. 23rd room better than the other 2, but still not liveable. It was 9.30pm. I had no choice and got no sleep.I would recommend bringing a sleeping bag and sleep in the streets rather than this so called hotel.

<Content>Waste of a night... I travelled with a group and stayed here during a layover. Though we had reserved the rooms 4 months in advance, they did not have the rooms ready when we arrived at 7 PM. We had to get up early to leave, but most of the group was unable to get a shower as they had no towels for us. The room for me was completely unliveable (beds against the wall on their side and the bathroom was filthy). I was forced to bunk in with a triple in an already crowded room. The staff on duty was very polite, but could do nothing to help the situation, apparently. Find any other hotel and it would probably be better than this one.
