<Content>Not bad Depending on how you look at Mexico City and how you want to experience it, hotel Ejecutivo is not a bad option for budget travelers. I mean, beside staying at 5 stars expensive hotel, most hotels in Mexico city will disappoint you if luxury is what you are looking for. Hotel Ejecutivo is clean, well located, and the staff is very helpful and friendly. On the bad side, the hotel is noisy (you hear everything that happens in the street, whether on the 1st floor or on the 10th floor), and thewifi internet does not access all the rooms, so you have to make lobbytrips to enjoy free internet. Some website advertises this hotel with a pool. Forget it, there is nopool there!All in all, a good budget hotel.

<Content>Good Location, Service Mediocre Well besides the main elevators breaking, and getting stuck in the back up elevators it had decent service. Its location was excellent, and I remember taking the green buses to Wal-Mart, walking to Starbucks, and passing the U.S. Embassy. The lack of Air-Conditioning was very annyoing, but they do give you a fan. For all of those walking across streets, be carefull the drivers are nuts!!!!

<Content>it's OK, not great Hotel Ejecutivo, is located near the pink zone (zona rosa). Ask for the renovated floor, it's the nicest. We paid $54 for this room, and have paid $50 for the rooms not renovated. You get bottled water (2) everyday, but coffee only on the first day (go figure). The restaurant food is mediocre, service is pretty good. It's kind of noisy  the rooms are not air conditioned. Taxi's are available 24 hours a day  makes going to  from the airport easy - about a 20 minute ride in the wee hours, but up to 2 hours in heavy traffic (avoid rush hour at all costs). As for anywhere in Mexico, count your change after a purchase, or when changing US$ into pesos.
