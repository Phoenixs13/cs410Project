<Content>Great Location It is an old hotel. I did have a new bed and the furniture looked new. My room was clean. I thought the staff was nice and helpful. The value for your money is there, it is expensive to eat out everyday, so eating in the room saved a lot of money. The beach and all of the high end shopping is just blocks away. Who spends much time in their room in Hawaii anyway? For me, saving money on the room and using the savings to do all of the activities in Hawaii was totally worth it. The General Manager is on property and very guest friendly.
