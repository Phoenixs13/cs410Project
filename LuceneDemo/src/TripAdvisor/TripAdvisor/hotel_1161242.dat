<Content>best location I stay in this hotel every time i go to Hong Kong. Service is great and the rooms are very comfortable. You get complimentary water too but you have to pay a steep price for internet. Its connected to Ocean Terminal which is a huge shopping area that connects the other Marco Polo hotels. It's a 3 minute walk towards the MTR on Nathan road. Since it is near the Harbor, its a 10minute walk to get there and you can ride the ferry towards Hong Kong Island (it's the more scenic route).

<Content>Excellent Service, best location There are three Macro Polo Hotels in Canton Road. I stayed in Macro Polo Prince before. I preferred Macro Polo Gateway. Gateway is located in the middle and it has the best location. It is only within 5-minutes walking distance to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR (subway) station. It is next to the upscale shopping center 鈥?Harbor City.  Hotel鈥檚 staff was excellent. Service was good. I was sick and I called the hotel desk for help. The hotel staff was so kind and he walked me to a nearby doctor.The hotel room was kind of outdated, and you would have 鈥渞eal key鈥?instead of access card. Closet in the room was not functioning at all. I could not even open it. I would say that the room was quite small and it would need renovation. However, it was clean.
