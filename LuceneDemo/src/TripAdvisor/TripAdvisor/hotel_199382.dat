<Content>A very good choice I stayed for 3 nights in the hotel Hanse. Although it is situated in a suburb it is only 3 blocks walk to the underground (5 mins). 3 stops on the underground and you are in central Berlin.The area is very quiet and quite affluent with good local ammenities. However not the place to stay if you are looking for a buzz or to be in the heart of things. The apartment was a bit dated but spacious and clean . The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was excellent. I booked online and paid 拢145 for 3 nights which i felt was very good value for money in Berlin.

<Content>Nice hotel with some rough edges The Apart Hotel Hanse is a small hotel in a quiet and pleasant suburban area of Berlin. It's close to the U-bahn station, and therefore convenient to all parts of the city, but not within walking distance of any major attractions.Our room was reasonably large and well equipped, but in need of a good freshen-up. It looked a bit tired and run down. There was a balcony overlooking the street.Breakfast was good, and the staff were friendly and helpful.

<Content>Excellent value We stayed here on 19 August 2004 and this little hotel was excellent value at 45 Euro for the night (an internet rate).The room and bathroom were a good size. The room was basic but had everything needed, including tv - just not air-conditioning. But that was okay - there were large windows that we opened for relief, as the night was a bit humid.The hotel is relatively close to a couple of metro stations (about a 5 minute walk) and therefore it's easy enough to make your way around. It was about 10 minutes on the metro from Zoo Station. There are eateries close by to the hotel, a convenience store across the road and supermarkets around the corner. Also a self service laundry close by.The area is quiet and peaceful, the hotel is in good shape and the staff were friendly. For the price it was excellent value and is recommended.
