<Content>Great Experience The service was excellent at the check-in time. The front desk coordinators have a good same of humor and empathize with most of the guest that passed by while I was at the business center. The rooms were very clean and neat. The surpervisors and managers are always present in the breakfast area helping the staff assisting all the guests. I felt at home. The room was very quite. They have also remodeled the entire hotel. It looks awesome and I could enjoyed my stay very much. Great atmosphere and customer service!!!! :)

<Content>Regular hotel, not for business This hotel offers basic accommodation services, service is regular to bad, rooms are ok, with all services, towels are ok, soap is cheap, bring yours, reception service feels like a truck MOTEL service, meaning no uniformed person, unshaved and bad attitude. Since the breakfast is included, the eat area looks unclean due to the nature of self service no waitress. It is really if you need to save little money (It is not cheap either) or want Hilton points and have no other option, stay here, other way use other hotels in the area, Intercontinental (5*), la quinta, Doral

<Content>quite satisfied I spent 3 nights at this hotel last week and was pleasantly surprised. My room was quiet, spotlessly clean and the bed extremely comfortable. The breakfast was standard for a Hampton Inn. The hotel is undergoing renovations but it looks like they are almost finished and the place looks clean and fresh. The only negative was that I waited over an hour at the airport expecting to see the shuttle bus drive by as they do, but had to go downstairs to phone the hotel to ask them to come and pick me up. They were there in about 20 minutes. I was told that the shuttle operated hourly so not sure what happened there. There are eating places in the plaza next door so the fact that there is no restaurant on site is not a problem.

<Content>This is a dump I travel for business constantly and this Hampton Inn was just terrible. The eating area had wallpaper peeling off, dirt around the baseboard, missing baseboards.The room was average size with a very small TV. A window air conditioner that was so loud, you could hardly sleep. The breakfast fare was way below other Hampton standards.Several reviews indicated that this hotel had a bar. It does not. This hotel needs a total update.

<Content>A little below par for a Hampton Inn OK -- but not up to Hampton Inn's usually high standards. First, the hotel is undergoing rennovations which was not mentioned or their web site or confirming email. I find this practice deceptive. Second, the hotel is a little dumpy and the cleaning crew wasn't doing their job. Someone spilled a cherry soda in one of the elevators and it stayed in there for the entire 48 hours I was in the hotel (even after mentioning it to the front desk staff, where a sign proclaimed let us know of any reason you wouldn't give us a 10 on a customer service survey!).The internet didn't work when I first plugged in, but the really helpful and energetic maintenance supervior replaced the whole wall plug-in, which was severely corroded. Kudos to him to sticking with it until things worked!The room was good, the bathroom clean, and everything else was in good working order. Breakfast was good and pool looked good as well.

<Content>Inconveniences I am overnighting and choose this location based on reviews on this site.The rating really should be a 2 but the staff are friendly. First off the free shuttle required a wait of over 35 minutes. I called the hotel 3 times. It was never mentioned that the shuttle only leaves on the hour which would have re-aligned my expectations. However the young driver was apologetic and friendly - but it was little consolation as I was extremely tired after awakening early to catch the flight.The front staff were also apologetic and assured me I would enjoy their comfortable beds. Unfortunately around 1:30 pm as I was trying to rest, drilling started. Yes they are undergoing rennovations! - a fact not mentioned on their website. Front desk again apologised and noted the noise can be heard from all rooms (did I believe them? no but when you are tired you really don't want to argue) I chose to go to the mall instead.My advice call the hotel directly and get an update on the rennovations before you book.

<Content>Excellent for first night after a long haul flight We flew in from the UK and after a 9 hour flight plus delays, were very glad we chose somewhere as convenient as this. The hotel is very clean throughout and has free secure parking, free internet, complimentary beverages 24hrs, and free breakfast. The beds were as comfortable as we like and although the hotel is near the airport (about 3 miles) there was no aircraft noise, or indeed any noise in our room. Breakfast available from 6am was also very welcome while we were getting used to the time difference.We stayed 2 nights before setting off on a grand tour of the Keys and Everglades. On the second day they didn't make up our room until about 4.30 pm, and as we were still tired, we would have liked to have gone back to bed for a nap before then. So that was a bit inconvenient, but I'm sure if we had asked for the room to be made up earlier they would have done it, so can't really be critical about that.All in all, just what we wanted and a good first stop.

<Content>Clean but basic, good for one night. We were flying home to England from Miami and needed a one night stop-over - nothing fancy or too expensive as it was literally just a place to sleep.We were allocated a room on level 4 - non smoking. The beds and pillows were clean and quite comfortable. The bedroom furniture was a bit tired looking as was the bathroom - but for the money it was OK - have been in pricier hotels that have not been as clean!The only main problem we encountered was the air conditioning unit being quite noisy. Previous hotels have had the modern units encased in the ceiling or wall and are very quiet in their operation - this was one was placed on the floor underneath the window and sounded very much like a diesel engine 'ticking over' until you turned it up and then it sounded like a diesel engine about to blow a gasket - also it was not very productive in keeping the room cool. Didn't bother with the inhouse food service [stops at 9.30pm I think] but ordered in, using a name we are familiar with in England, PIZZAHUT, they have the number on reception as it was not listed in the room brochure. It arrived direct to the door and was tasty and HOT! We took advantage of the inclusive breakfast, although the hot offerings didn't look to appetising the pastries were tasty and they had bagels, muffins, bread [with a toaster if you needed it] along with fruit, cereals and juices. Also I have to say that this was probably the best cup of tea I got whilst in USA!Free shuttle - if using to be collected from the airport you need to keep your eyes open and 'wave' it down - we were told to wait outside by American Airlines this we did........ but at the beginning of the terminals [A] when really we should have been further along the path nearer to terminal [C]. Had we been told this when we phoned in, it might have saved some time. Free shuttle - if using to leave the hotel, it leaves on the hour.The staff overall were not very helpful and always seemed to act as if it was hard work answering questions, both on the telephone and in person.Overall for the money though it was a good place just for the one night, especially including the free shuttle and breakfast, especially if you are on a tight budget.

<Content>Great! I stayed here May 2005 the weekend of Memorial Day and I loved it! The service was excellent and I had a great room for the price $69.99 per night! I had a king size bed with two chairs and a nice bathroom. The rooms were clean-equipped with a nice welcome note and Doritos,Oreos and bottled water! I'm a Hampton Inn fan anyway and have been for 10 years now so they lived up to the Hampton Inn standards I have come to love! This was my first visit to Miami so Hampton Inn made my stay a memorable one! I'll be back!

<Content>excellent Stayed at the Hampton Inn for seven days. Rooms were clean and comfortable, good value for the money. Fulll hot Breakfast from 6-10am each day, good selection and good quality. Local phone calls are free and all rooms have free high speed internet access which is awesome is you travel with a laptop or on business. Hotel has a business center with computers to use free of charge. The hotel is right next to the Palmetto 826 which makes it easy to go north or south . There are alot of shopping centers and restaurants within a 5 minute drive of the hotel and the shuttle drivers will take you anywhere within a short distance of the hotel. If you are staying for business or visiting freinds or family in the NW or SW parts of Miami/Dade county this hotel can't be beat. The hotel is also close to the Dolphin mall ,Mall of Americas ,International mall and the Doral Country Club

<Content>Not Up to the Usual Hampton Inn Standard Hampton Inns are usually pretty good quality for the dollar, but this was an exception. My room was pretty dirty - complete with the previous guest's used Kleenex on the floor near the head of the bed! Guess that pretty much sums up all you need to know. There was a stale air smell and the neighborhood is kinda sketchy.
