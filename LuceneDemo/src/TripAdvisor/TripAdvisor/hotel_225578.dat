<Content>Stay here, it is so nice and clean Stayed here on our way to Sedona. What a pleasant surprise for a road side type hotel. The front desk was professional and so nice. Check in a breeze.The room was so clean and modern and very roomy. They launder everything in the room after each customer.The breakfast room was sunny and you could sit outside if you wanted to.I am so picky, so if I tell you it is a nice place to stay, it really is.

<Content>Finally adding my review on this quality hotel I have stayed at this hotel the past 2 times I have gone to Arizona to visit my family who live in Anthem. The hotel is very clean and the beds are comfortable. They have a nice size pool that seems to always be empty when we go, which is nice for us! They have a continental breakfast which is decent as well. The staff is always very nice and accommodating. The price can't be beat and the location is great. No complaints!!

<Content>Brilliant value Little to add to what others have said. Just about a perfect experience. We stayed twice and on each occasion the room and staff were beyond criticism. If you are a Brit flying into Phoenix and traveling on, then this hotel can be reached from the airport in about 40 minutes. Better and cheaper than anything you are likely to find near the airport.

<Content>Kudos to the staff I have nothing but praise for this property and the wonderful people that work there. Our room was lovely, great bed, very clean bathroom. We booked a one night stay before flying home the next day. My husband became very ill during the night; we ended up having to cancel our plane reservations as he was too ill to travel. Not only did management extend our stay for us, they did it for two more nights as my hubby ended up in the ER. When we came back to the hotel at 3 AM, the staff opened the kitchen and fixed me a bagel when I mentioned I was starving. All this and a NASCAR race pending to boot - they were completely booked up. They bent over backwards for us. Kudos to them all! This is long overdue. I also must praise the guys at Daisy Mountain Fire and Rescue. One of them drove my rental car to the hospital so I could ride in the ambulance with my husband. Then they hung around the hospital talking to me, keeping me company while my husband was examined then they gave me their cell phone numbers in case I needed anything. They even showed up hours later to check on us. What great guys! The Anthem area is blessed to have them looking out for them! Will MOST DEFINITELY stay here the next time we come to Phoenix.

<Content>Loved this stopover This Hampton Inn was a terrific stay for an excellent price. The room was well-appointed and the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds my husband and I have ever experienced. We would definitely recommend it to other travelers.

<Content>Great First Night In Arizona We loved the Hampton Inn in Anthem! The front desk staff, Ed and Scott were wonderul. I loved the coffee available in the lobby all day and night with cookies too! Our room was super clean and comfortable. The breakfast is adequate but nothing really special. There is the outlet mall within walking distance and restaurants are very close by as well. This was our first night stay in Arizona on our way to the Grand Canyon . Thank you Trip Advisor for helping us find this great place !

<Content>An unknown Jewel My husband miscalculated how late we would be getting into Phoenix on our trek to Sedona, so I had to look around for another place to stay at the last moment. We found the Hampton quite by accident, but the location seemed perfect for our purposes.When we arrived the very pleasant manager and check-in staff hoped we had a reservation because they only had one handicapped room left. We did and they very efficiently checked us in.Despite a wedding and a golf tournament, this booked to capacity hotel was extremely quiet. the beds were wonderful, the room was clean, the hot breakfast the next morning was very good.The best part is the location if you are heading north on 17. You are next door to an outlet mall, a wal-mart, and a few fast restaurants, but you are outside the traffic of Phoenix and despite the location, we did not experience any noise at all. A very restful night's sleep.We would most definitely stay there again.

<Content>Thank God we found this hotel.... I got sick in Tucson while on the way to El Paso. My wife and I had to turn around and drive back to California. We made it to this hotel on the first day...we were allowed to check in early and I went right to bed...the room was great...quiet and very clean...the beds very comfortable...I don't see how we could have found a better place to stay...we stayed at the Hampton Inn locations in Kingman, Az and Barstow, Ca the last two nights of our trip home and were glad we did...excellent accommodations and great people...we would recommend Hampton Inns to anybody...

<Content>Great place to stay We staid at the Hampton inn  Suites twice last month. We had originally booked it for the first night of a one month vacation in the western US and thanks to Delta and JFK airport we arrived at the hotel at 3 am in the morningEven though the front door was locked and we had to ring the bell, the welcome was great. We got our room quickly and the night concierge even opened up the small lobby shop so we could get some water for the night. We were so impressed with the first stay that we booked a night for the final night of our vacation before flying home. Again the service was impressive. Check inn were quick and the front desk helped with boarding passes and supplied us with a card with directions to the airport.We would highly recommend this hotel, and will probably chose to stay here when we come back next time. The location next to a shopping area with lots of restaurants were a plus as well.The roomsThe rooms for both stays were identical, large and very, very clean. The beds were great, and small sofa section very nice. The bathrooms very clean and the hotel had supplied lots of good quality shampoo, lotion etc...Breakfast. The hotel breakfast is nice, with different hot items every day. It also have lots of fruits and a good supply of cereals and breads. The breakfast hostess kept the breakfast area nice and tidy all the time.

<Content>Very Pleasant Spent a night for a nearby wedding. Very nice experience. Quick and professional check-in, large. very clean and cool room. Denny's and mexican fast food shares the parking lot. Anthem Outlet mall across the street. The pool is small and there is little shade, but towels were provided and we still enjoyed it. There is a little sort of snack shop off the front desk that is expensive but handy. We didn't have the complimentary breakfast there, but the area seemed relatively large and inviting.

<Content>Very restful night at the Hampton Inn - Anthem, AZ We stayed one night in a deluxe king with an in-room jacuzzi. The room was large and well-appointed. After a long day of driving, we were looking forward to the whirlpool. The tub only had three jets, so it was not quite as therapeutic as we had hoped.The morning breakfast bar was well laid out with plenty of variety from cold to hot. Sure to please every palate.One negative was the lack of wireless internet connectivity in our guestroom, although I could get connected in the lobby area. My husband was able to use an ethernet connection in the room. (My computer does not support ethernet.)Friendly and helpful check-in staff.I would certainly recommend this hotel.

<Content>expensive but worth it As soon as we saw the huge room, our decision was made. High ceilings make everything look bigger but we really appreciated the 2 phones, the lounge area and fridge and micro. The bathroom was a liitle small and we did have some problems that were sorted immediately. The bath water only trickled away, the tv was plugged in wrongly and I got stuck in the bathroom! The breakfast choices are varied especially if you have children. The outlet centre is almost opposite and that is worth a visit just to look at the beautifully manicured gardens. Anthem is a growing town and there's little for the tourist. Thoroughly recommend the Asianakitchen restaurant. Huge Asian dishes which are cheap and extremely well presented. Lake Pleasant is close and beautiful.At check-out, I did mention that the pool had not been cleaned but I'm sure by just mentioning it, the maintenance men will be there immediately!

<Content>Was great through and through Wow. I havent needed to stay at a hotel in a while, but glad I chose this one. As soon as I walked in, I of course asked for the rate. I really didnt want to spend that much, after all I only needed a nights sleep. However I am soo glad I did decide to stay. I was on my way up to Sedona and had an appt the next morning. And after all day at a Phoenix water park didnt really want to drive. The 2 queen beds were perfect. So much room. The staff is in every way awesome. Literally everyone I met was great and friendly. Very Roomy in rm 111. The new overstuffed bedding, with a choice of hard pillows on one bed and soft on the other and a note just to call if you needed more or to change what was there, Great! There is even a small lap table to use your laptop on. And the computer room is great. Though only one computer. It has printer, fax, internet, phone etc. Everything ready to completely do your work if needed. (and I did need to do a little). Tis a pool facing rm on first floor, but was very quiet. There is a small store with a few other necessities if you need to buy something, (from juices to food etc.)along with a workout room with 3 machines. As previously mentioned, Iron/brd in armoire, nice refrigerator already on, along with air condition in room. Nice touch after having been outside all day. The bathroom was good. It had the new arched outward shower curtain bar for more room inside the tub. Plenty of soft towels. Forgot my toothpaste and front desk gentleman provided quickly with no problems. The only thing I thought was missing was although there was a fan in the bathroom, it is the automatic kind, that is slow to me. I would have preferred the one with a switch, that kind is faster. The breakfast again was great. So many choices, along with reg/decaf coffee and also Extra Strong. I was a little sad there was no pancakes that day, but the lady explained how the breakfast changed daily, and the next day there would be! I almost stayed another night. The fruit was great and fresh along with all the breads. Even if you get up late they have a prepared breakfast to go bag waiting for you at the desk when checking out.! Great.... But my most rememerable experience was all the staff. The late front desk manager, who talked me into staying. everyone. She did note that their hotel was the last one for the next hour heading north. And in driving the next day, this was the truth. And as everyone knows it is the staff that can make or break a delightful stay. Even if things are horribly wrong, a great staff can more than make up for it. And I feel that if something had gone horribly wrong, the staff would have turned it right around.There is a Walmart, Denny's and even a Car Repair shop within walking distance. So again All in All a wonderful stay. Thanks Hampton!!

<Content>Great experience start to finish! We arrived at the hotel at 11:45pm, as I walked through the front doors, the front deskman said Welcome to the Hampton Inn, you must be Troy  Christi lastname. That was a wonderful touch, like we were expected and welcome. Granted it was very late and we were the 2nd to the last checkin, but after driving almost 7 hours it made me smile. Everyone was very accomodating- when our iron quit working the maid had one there in 5 minutes, so how could you possibly unhappy the iron didn't work?The lobby is nicely decorated with big comfy sofas, the room to the east is where breakfast is served. It is a GREAT breakfast. It is typical serve yourself, but what they offer is no where near typical. They have cold cereal, hot cereal, eggs, salsa, ketchup, sausage, bagels, different types of breads to toast, crescents, jellies, butter, margerine, 3 types of coffees, flavored creamers, hot teas, apple juice, oj, fresh cut up fruit, hot teas, milk, On sunday they also had bisquits and gravy. I think the eggs were powdered, but I am NOT complaining! My husband and I left pleasantly full- a great way to start the day. Our room was a King/study. As you walk in first is the closet and bathroom, then is a living room type area, with a fold out sofa, microwave, refrigerator, that you can actually use, coffee maker, a nice desk w/internet hookup. The bedroom area is the other half of the room, the king size bed was roomy, there is an armoire for more closet space and the iron/board. The tv is located in the bedroom half of the room but can be swiveled to face the sofa.Location is PERFECT for visting family in Anthem so you don't have to drive from Phoenix which is quite aways away. There is a Denny's and Del Taco sharing the Driveway/Street with the hotel. It is across the street from the Anthem Outlet mall which is AWESOME, among the many stores I found Ann Taylor, Gap,lots more. A two minute drive on the same street is a SUPER Walmart- being from California I had never experienced a SUPER Walmart before and I LOVED it!!IMHO it was better than Hyatts that we've stayed at.Highly Recommended
