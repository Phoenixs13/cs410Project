<Content>Fantastic rooms! I spent 3 days in the AC Victoria Suites on a business trip. The hotel is stunning! I was told that the hotel was fully refurbished last year 2007, and has now joined the hotel chain AC Hotels. It has 50 suites, with excellent design. The employees are very helpful. I had dinner at the hotels restaurant, which is called the Neichel, and has a 1-star michelin...what a fantastic surprise. The hotel is not in the centre, but it is absolutelly the ideal place to relax, lay at the swimming pool and get a good sleep after a day walking through the busy Ramblas.

<Content>Good week at Victoria Suites I stayed at the Victoria Suites for a week while in Barcelona for a conference. The location isn't perfect, it is about six blocks from the nearest metro stop. There's nothing interesting around the hotel, nothing of interest to a tourist. By the metro, however, are shopping and restaurants. The hotel is just off the beaten path (but in a very safe area, no worries about walking).I dealt with pretty much all of the front desk staff during my stay. Some were friendly from the get-go, most were pretty reserved, and one woman was downright unfriendly for the first half of my stay. However, she eventually warmed up to me as I worked hard at being nice. Still, it was pretty offputting to be paying a crazy nightly rate and have dismissive service at times. I will say that I had some odd requests and the front desk did have to go out of their way to serve me, which they did.My suite was new, modern and spotless. It began with an entryway alcove with a mini-fridge which held only beverages - free beverages! Sodas, waters and one beer, they were replenished daily. The next space was a parlor with a couch and coffee table, and a work desk. Internet (wi-fi) was expensive and had to be purchased at the front desk, you could buy cards for an hour or 24 hours. You couldn't use the same card for multiple computers, even if you were only using one machine at a time. There was a nice flat-screen TV on a rolling cart that you could roll to face the parlor or the bedroom. The only station in English was CNN.The beds would have been comfortable except that my king bed was two twins pushed together. Other rooms had true kings, so be sure to check before you settle on your room, if that is important to you. Two twins pushed together is as useful as one twin, since you can't stretch out.The bathroom was nice, modern, no complaints there.There was no air-conditioning available, though I think they do have it in the summer, but not the winter. But I thought the room was way too warm, especially overnight. My rate included the breakfast buffet, which was a wonderful spread of meats, cheeses, pastries, yogurt, cereal, fruits. Pretty much anything (cold) that you could desire. Had I been a tourist I would have eaten late and this would have more than covered lunch for me.Overall, I did have a good stay at this hotel. However, if I were picking again I'd try to get a hotel closer to the metro with better dining options around it.

<Content>Good value in the university area The apartments are useful for a stay of several days, as you get a living area and kitchenette and balcony, but it lacks double glazing and can be somewhat noisy... the tile floors give them a cold look, though fine in summer. Shower heads were very poor. Breakfast was nice, as were the staff. A colleague was staying on the top floor and got a room, or what seemed like a suite, with a fantastic bathroom and lovely bed. I would recommend to take this if possible! 10 minute walk from the metro.

<Content>good quality We stayed three nights at the victoria suites which is located on avra pedrables very near in the Nou Camp in Barcelona. The hotel has a four star standard and i think that was fair. Staff are very helpful, rooms are large, modern and have self catering facilites as well as large bathroom and living area. The hotel is located around a ten minutes walk from the football stadium and around 8 euros in a taxi from la rambla (centre of barcelona)Maria christina is the nearest metro stop which is a 5 minute walk down the diagonal (main street from hotel). A ticket for ten journeys is 6 euros which is well worth it. The best stop to get off for la rambla is Catalunya which is just at the top of this street and opposite the hard rock cafe. They ae so many good restaurant and bars and we tended to go around the plaza real which is (when walking down la rambla) on the rights by macdonaldsOverall the hotel was great and a good time was had by all

<Content>Not what I expected from a 4* We've just returned from a weeks holiday in Barcelona. Myself, hubby and 2 kids. Hotel looked very nice from the outside. Reception area nice and clean, nothing special though. The room was quite big - a living area, 2 bedrooms and bathroom. Quite spacious but also very basic the rooms were clean. Swimmng pool was closed whilst we stayed there which was quite annoying although access to the pool was next to the main hotel entrance. Had breakfast only on the first day - quite disappointed with the choice and quality of food on offer, 10 euros per person too expensive !!!. The most annoying thing we found was the noise - we could hear people walking in the room above us; cars/lorries outside especially at around 11pm when the dustbin men come to empty the recycle bottle bins every night.. Would not rate this hotel as a 4 star - definitely 3 star. Would not go back although barcelona has limited family or hotels with adjoining rooms.Location was just outside the main city area very quiet and safe walked around at midnight no problems people and restaurants in area very nice. 10 mins from NU Camp and 5 min from tube station and bus stops including main tourist red route. Childrens small play area just outside hotel which the kids enjoyed. overall a okay hotel just spoilt by the breakfast, noise and lack of atmosphere.

<Content>Excellent Hotel! Myself and my husband stayed at the Victoria Suites for a child free weekend! I would easily say it was a good 4* hotel. I am the type of person who thinks the hotel makes the holiday as on many occasions I have been let down with the standard of hotels in the past...I was very impressed with the size of the suite, nice decor and it was very clean.The staff spoke very little english but we managed to make ourselves understood. They were very friendly and always willing to help. Ordering a taxi was never any problem, where ever you wanted to be it always worked out 5 euros per journey.The hotel is situated in the business district, very close to Barcelona Football Stadium which is well worth a visit whether you are into football or not. There are a few bars and a nice restarent over the road (about 200 yards away).Overall a really good hotel... highly recommended, cant wait to go back!
