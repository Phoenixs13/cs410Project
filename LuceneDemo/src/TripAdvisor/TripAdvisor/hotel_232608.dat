<Content>not too bad! I was in the hotel as a teacher with 78 pupils.It was value for money and the youngsters were suprised about the rooms and about breakfast.I would not suggest it for individual travellers who long for luxury, but for more or less low budget and for schools it's perfeect!

<Content>Not my favourite Hotel We stayed here for 2 nights with some German friends. The Hotel is very average. I wouldn't reccommend it. It is a long way from the centre of Berlin and a long way from the main tourist attractions. It is about a 5 plus minute walk to the tram stop and then another 30 minutes by tram into Alexanderplatz. We ate dinner at the restaurant and it was OK but the breakfast(included in the room rate) was fairly ordinary. There were a few large groups of school kids staying here and they were very noisy, especially in the middle of the night!! The view from our room was of a disused factory littered with rubbish. I think this Hotel is mainly used by large school groups. I would recommend that if you were visiting Berlin to see the sights, you would be better off to stay closer into the Centre.

<Content>Average We just stayed at this hotel with a group of high school students. I have mixed feelings about the hotel.Pros-------Staff is relatively friendly and most speak English fairly well. Restaurant serves decent food. Rooms are fairly spacious.Cons-------Very remote location. Closest public transportation is a 5 minute walk to a tramway, not the subway (U-bahn). Ride to Alexanderplatz is approximately 30 minutes. This is a residential neighborhood so not much to do. There is a small bar/restaurant in the area that is awesome. The hotel is a former dorm, so that's what the rooms look like. Beds are hard as a rock and my back ached every morning.

<Content>Clean, comfortable and relativly cheap This is a very nice hotel for those who don't mind taking public transportation into the city. That really was the only negative I could find about the place. It is very functional and family oriented. The rooms are comfortable and the food is good. The short distance into the city is an easy price to pay for those travelling on a budget.

<Content>Enjoyed Though it is a small hotel it is in what was the former East. The hotel was clean the food was goodand for the most part the staff were great, there was one or two that let them down, bar staff being one. I think I know a good wine from a bad wine by now. The hotel is in a resedential area, transportconnections are not far though and no doubt there is an abundance of taxis. Go for coffee and cake its seems to an institution and is great. If you go about Easter time its like Christmas all over again. Loved the German people they couldnt do enough to help. We are planning on going back in the near future. when we were there, there was a few Russian folk about, but they didnt even return my good morning or hi or smile. Thats my aim to have coffee with someone Russian.
