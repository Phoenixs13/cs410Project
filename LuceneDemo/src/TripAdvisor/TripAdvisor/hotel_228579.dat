<Content>Great location - Clean and comfortable room Spent 3 nights at the Atlantis. We were very happy with our room. It was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The location was wonderful. We were close to Las Ramblas and to public transportation. The On/Off bus was a few blocks away and it was an easy walk to the Sagrada Familia and the Picasso Museum. With most of the hotels so very expensive, we were delighted to discover the Atlantis for 107 E per night with breakfast and taxes included.*Best dining experience was at Botafumeira. Excellent food, beautiful presentation, and attentive service*Best tapa experience was at La Boqueria. What a fun, fun place that is!

<Content>A Very Pleasant Surprise! We got a great rate for this hotel-- and it was in the perfect location, just at the top of Ramblas-- so we didn't expect it to be great. We were pleasantly surprised. No Noise at all. We were in a room that had a window facing into a center solarium-ish opening. You could see other people's windows across the opening... but not a problem, as we kept our curtains shut. It was not far from the elevator... but was completely quiet. No noise at all. Very clean. Smallish bathroom. Good shower. Front desk was helpful when we needed it. Free wifi and also use of 1 computer near the front desk. (must stand to use the computer-- but this tends to limit people's time, so didn't usually have to wait.) Breakfast was slightly above average. fresh fruit. several choices of protein (soft and sliced cheese, ham, boiled eggs) several breads  cereals, fruit juice, toaster... it was quite a good selection. This is a short block off of Ramblas, at the top. Easy to walk down Ramblas or Passeig Gracia. Very near our favorite ice cream at Panelles Donat on the cute Portal de l'Angel. We liked this hotel for its location, cleanliness, and very quiet room. If noise is an issue, ask for a room around the solarium (i don't know what to call it... a space where 4 rooms face inward toward an empty space....??) -kawh

<Content>Great city hotel in a perfect location! Just returned from 2 night stay in Hotel atlantis following a 5 night med cruise.Was a little nervous as we had read some rv's that weren't too good.However, we found that the hotel was ideally located at the top of Las Ramblas. The rooms were clean, spacious, fresh towels daily and great facilities.The bar was closed ( don't know why) but we were made very welcome in the neighbouring hotel Lleo.We had our 3 year old son with us and found the Hotel perfect.We were overlooking the courtyard and there was no noise or disturbance.Highly recommend this hotel or if it is booked - try the lovely Hotel Lleo next door.

<Content>Great Hotel...but a bit noisy! My sister and I stayed at the Atlantis from 3 to 6 June 2008 and had a great time. The hotel is ideally situated, 5mn from Placa de Catalunya where you can catch the Aerobus to the airport and Las Ramblas, a long street with many shops and restaurants. It is also close to all other attractions. Our room was nicely decorated and rather spacious, the only downside was that it was overlooking Carrer de Pelai, a very busy street, and the volume of noise was terrible! Moreover the windows were old and not closing properly so it was difficult to sleep but we somehow managed as we were tired after walking around town all day! The breakfast was quite good with a wide selection of food. All in all, a good experience and I would recommend it but I advise you to request a room overlooking the courtyard when you book if you want to have a good night sleep....

<Content>Total noise + Total charge The rooms are clean, rather large and reasonably equiped. A pity that sleeping is impossible in those located at the front of the hotel, even on the top floor and with earplugs.These rooms (most of the hotel's) are directly overlooking one of Barcelona's busiest streets, with lots of buses. Their windows have no noise protection and some do not even close properly.The reception is frigid, I was refused a sheet of paper with the hotel name and address printed on it..Worse, the hotel said that it had not received a reservation cancellation that I had mailed and it charged my visa card at 100% against my will.

<Content>Great hotel but noisy. We stayed 3 nights at the Atlantis in February and overall everything was great. Our junior suite on floor 3, was very spacious, clean and modern with a great bathroom and very comfortable beds. There was a great choice at breakfast ,staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast room was clean and bright. The hotel's location is perfect, only 3 minutes walk to the top of Las Ramblas and there is a good range of shops, bars and restaurants nearby. There was however some problems with noise. A very noisy, foulmouthed American occupied the room next door on our 2nd night and woke us all at 6.00am when he returned drunk and started screaming and shouting.During our 3rd night, someone held a rave party in a nearby apartment and we were kept awake for 2 hours. The hotel concierge was apologetic and investigated but could not help. If you visit this hotel it might be worth checking if this problem is a regular occurence. Earplugs are recommended.

<Content>Great Central Location Having stayed in Barcelona before we knew the location. I read the reviews on here and went ahead and booked. Turned out to be a great move! The hotel is just off Cataluna Square at the top of Las Ramblas and convenient to all local sites/shopping etc. We were only there one night (Fri 5 Oct) as a pre cruise stay.Check-in was a breeze and the room (508) was small but adequate for 2 people. It looked like it had been recently renovated as the bathroom and fittings all looked new.Overall we would go back to it again.

<Content>really pleasant I recently stayed at the Atlantis and found it a very nice hotel. The rooms were clean and although we were put in a room next to the lift shaft, when we asked to be moved, the staff found us a quiter room immediately. The breakfast was fine and plenty to pick from.The position of this hotel is really fantastic. Step out the door and you are close to The Ramblas and all the good shops.Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel if you want a great position.

<Content>Atlantis Hotel..a nice experience. Atlantis Hotel. Barcelona SpainReviewer: A Trip Advisor member. Bristol UK.Stayed in the Atlantis between the 4th and 8th June 2007. A nice hotel, superbly situated at Pelai 20 some 150 metres from the start of the Rambla and central to just about everything you would wish for in a central Barcelona hotel. Had a double room on the top (5th) floor that was double glazed and therefore quiet with excellent air conditioning, comfortable beds and generally was in good decorative order.The breakfast was adequate with eggs, sausage bacon etc. as well as fresh and tinned fruits, meats, cheeses and cereals. The minor downside was that the toaster was not working but with only two female staff they were put under a lot of pressure especially when most of the guests decided on breakfast at the same time. All in all, a nice experience in this small but charming hotel. The reception staff were friendly and extremely helpful and I will be recommending it to my friends.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay I stayed here in August 2006 and I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. It doesn't look like much from the outside but our room was lovely and large. However, I was traveling with my wife and 2 children so we did have a large room. The receptionist told us it was the nicest room in the hotel. Location is perfect near Placa Universidad and steps away from La Ramblas and Placa Catalunia. Metro stop a few metres outsied the hotel also if you need it. We only used the metro when we went to the Marina and the Zoo. Breakfast is adequate. Hot buffet! The usual hotel stuff. I think this hotel must have been recently renovated. I would definetely stay there again. Wifi in the lounge area near the breakfast room.

<Content>Bed Bugs!! No kidding. I was COVERED with bed bug bites after staying for 3 nights in this hotel. They lasted for 12 days and made my holiday uncomfortable (to say the least). I showed the hotel staff my bites and they said, 'It could maybe be a misquito.' However, they were kind enough to give me a 15% discount. Literally, I had the bites everywhere, it's impossible that they were from misquitos. The hotel is wonderful aside from that awful detail! Be warned!
