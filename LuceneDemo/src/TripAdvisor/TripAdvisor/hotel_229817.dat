<Content>Nice hotel but a bit far from downtown We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in December 2008. The hotel has ok lobby service and very good restaurant. We were there for a working/sight seeing trip. In the cold of the winter, the room was nice, very clean and warm. Seems like a new hotel to us, or may be it was renovated. What we really liked was the breakfast. Better than what we expected, actually, it was very good with good service. Only complaint maybe that it is a good 30 minutes from the main shopping street by train (cost only 2.6euros). But this is not really a problem for me as I travel a lot in Europe and best way to save is to get a hotel that is a bit far away. If you have more budget, then getting a downtown hotel would be better.

<Content>This Hotel's a fraud. Spent 4 nights there. Never seen such a poor breakfast, even in 2 stars hotels. Howerver, our room had a nice 12 TV back from the 80s. I even wonder whether the painting in the room, representing dying sunflowers, was ironic.

<Content>Love-hate relationship I spent three nights at this hotel recently, and while the hotel has good points, other negative ones were really annoying me.First, the location. I didn't choose the hotel because of the location, I was attending a conference so the choice had been made by the organisators of the conference. The hotel is a good 30 minutes S-bahn journey of the city center of Berlin. This is feasable, but not practical. I would not recommend this hotel if you are planning on visiting Berlin, as the travelling can get much. But on the other hand, the S-bahn station Spresow is situated right in front of the hotel, so access to public transport can't be better.Which brings me to my next point: noise. If your room is on the S-bahn side, you'll hear the trains pass by at all hours of the day and night. It's survivable with earplugs, but if you're a light sleeper, be sure you ask for a room on the other side. The rooms are fine, good size, clean. Bed really comfortable.The decor might be a bit kitsch for my taste, but that's personal. Some rooms are bigger than others; if you want a bigger room, be sure to ask one that is located in the round tower of the hotel. The cleaning staff is really friendly and they do a great job.The restaurant is located on the 16th floor, which also offers a breathtaking view of the surroundings. That is definitely a plus! I really enjoyed looking out the window and I took wonderful pictures... The food served at the restaurant is average. Good, but not wonderful. It serves its purpose, I guess. The staff is friendly, but they look like they are not interested. But they are friendly! And speak good English, really want to make sure you enjoy your meal, etc. On the outside though, you'd get the impression that they'd rather be somewhere else... In regards to business services, they have a wired/wireless Internet connection, but it's not free. It's quite pricey, actually. But don't expect other services. When I wanted to print a document, they didn't have a business center or anything like that, where I could have access to a printer. I had to e-mail my document to the reception, but even that didn't work as he couldn't open the attachment. Nevertheless, the staff at the reception was helpful and truly sorry they could not be of any help. So if I were to write any constructive comment, I would say they should open a small business center with computers, printer, fax, etc. like those you see in many hotels.So in the end, this hotel isn't bad, it's a good quality hotel! But there are still some points that make me go hmmm...

<Content>Awfull, Dont go!! We were actually booked there by a travel agency taking us to a FAM trip. (these free trips travel organizers book to show their product..) The hotel is like 20-25 min away from any place in Berlin you could consider as center (if there is one!!) with the Sbaund, and the rooms NOT CLEAN,the walls paperwalls!, the food the worst i ve ever seen ;P - we only had a bite to ensure that it tasted as bad as it looked. The only good thing were the maids that were super polite as well as the guy in the reception that was super helpfull. Which actually, all these, dont make a stay there unforgettable - only in the negative terms.
