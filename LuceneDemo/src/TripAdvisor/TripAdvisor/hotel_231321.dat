<Content>Stay here if you're looking for a retro 1970's Eastern block experience! Very worn out and tatty. Noisy at the front as the windows were poor and didn't shut properly. Breakfast included but poor (didn't think you could get coffee that bad outside the UK). Don't leave it too late to have a shower in the morning as the hot water runs out. We've stayed in Amsterdam several times before and know you won't get luxury unless you pay a small fortune, but all in all the Delta is about what you'd expect for half the price. The only good thing about it is it's location.

<Content>Simply Disgusting 3* no way..... It is the most disgusting place i have ever stayed in and i couldnt wait for the two nights to be over. The hotel is a tiny dingy place and after seeing the room we were allocated i just wanted to run out of the place but knew we wouldnt find any place else at such short notice. The windows were all broken and the wood rotten. The bed just about fit in the room and no space at all around it. you would have to climb in to it from the bottom. Needless to say there were no bedside lockers. The room was so dark. The carpet was so filthy and the sheets on the bed stained. I couldnt figure out how they could justify selling this room at all. Revolting.The bathroom although tiny was relatively clean. Of course i went to reception and told them i couldnt possibly stay in such a room and the receptionist gave me keys of two other rooms to look at. They were just a fraction better so we choose one. The beds in that place should all be burnt. If the carpet was clean i would probably have slept on the floor they were so uncomfortable. One evening while we were waiting in reception for friends another guest came down waving a rubber mask and demanding to know how it got in his shower. He was furious and said it wasnt there when he left his room in the morning. Weird or what but he wasnt one bit impressed. The only thing you could eat at breakfast was the toast. The scrambled eggs were like rubber and the bacon was swimming in a couple inches of fat. The fruit was tinned with the exception of a basket of oranges and you were lucky to find a cup for your coffee. I was ever so glad to get out of the place. A vending machine in the hotel lobby offered snacks at 鈧?.50 each for twix, kitkat, etc. RIP OFF. I must say the reception staff were nice and it did appear that many things were way out of their control. Management on the other hand should be held accountable.

<Content>Unclean room The room was not made up and they wouldn't give us another one. We were on 5th floor and went down 3 times to get someone to make it up. The maids had all gone home and finally the room clerk came up and gave us clean towels and clean linens. The view was to an alley and the hotel was noisy.

<Content>Good value at the Delta Hotel Amsterdam My self and a friend booked into the Delta Hotel in Amsterdam for a three day break in August 2008, it was the cheapest of all the hotels we had looked at on the net and we dicided to take a chance and book same. We were pleasently surprised, the rooms were big and comfortable and very clean, which was great, due to the weather, which was quite cool and wet for the duration of our stay. The staff were friendly and helpful and very pleasant, which encouraged the other guests to be friendly and share their adventures at breakfast. Breakfast was a buffet try the eggs and bacon they were just what a tourist needed to start the day. This hotel is not the Ritz however its central location, the friendly service, the excellent breakfast and the light airy room has made me write this review.

<Content>Three strikes - not stars - you're out! The pictures and the reality could not be more different... I will compain to the local hotels association in Amsterdam. When I arrived I was perplexed by the rather gloomy reception.When I entered the room I was shocked - for GB Pounds 95.00 and 3 stars I was expecting something akin to what I can expect in London... for 3 stars and less.This hotel should be immediately downgraded to a hostel and actual photos reflect the spartan and amateurishly cleaned room. I stayed in 366 - a single room facing what can only be described as an ashtray, where even the malfuntioning TV reflected this Adams Family horror story masquerading as a venue fit for human habitation.Do not stay here, no matter how desperate... I refer you to the following link for more of the same...[--]

<Content>disgusting 3star my bottom we booked through easyjet. went for surprise for husbands 50th what a surprise, got there the front held up with scaffolding , thought well bad look won,t get a view, Was given room on the second floor, facing view, roof full of rubbish, disgusting and stinking, , doublebed just bigger than a single, tunded back the Single, sheets and the mattress , never ever seen anything like it full of everything you could think of and i mean everything, we were both nearly sick the room went back to the 1950s if not further and during the nighe the stink form the bathroom was unbelivable from the drains thought we were chocking, Had no chose but to spend all days walking the streets and sight seeing, had to be either intoxicated or high to go back to such a place, the breakfast was thrown together if you can call it that, and the receptionist was a ignorent b...h kept us waiting while she chatted on the phone, knowing i had a crutch due to a recent knee replacement. nothing is cheap in Amsterdam we spent as much in two days as you would spend a week else where. Been 3 times before but stayed at the Golden Tulip in ZAMDAM not much differance in price but beautiful and the AMSTELLVEEN hotel in AMSTELVEEN worth the bus ride , WELL THIS WAS DEFINATLEY A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY.

<Content>Absolute Dump! Booked the hotel via EasyJet Hotels - don't they ever check out what they recommend?!I shared a room with my father in law - 4th to 6th July 2008.The single beds we had were small and both beds were up against opposite walls with a gap of 14 inches in between - gives you an idea of how small the room was.The carpet and walls, ceilings paintwork was ancient and filthy - only the bathroom was relatively clean. The furniture appeared to have been purchased from Oxfam - several years ago!Bannister rails were missing from staircase walls.Breakfast was included in the price - but there was hardly any choice - fruit, bread, cereal, salami, boiled eggs, scambled egg and very fatty bacon - plan for breakfast elsewhere!Basically, if you're considering it - book elsewhere. If you've booked it - unlucky (as we were)!

<Content>absolute disgrace, should be shut down Stayed here last weekend and can honestly say without doubt that this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in and that's saying something. Reception clerk was rude, demanding and completely insincere. Hotel staff were non-existent. The room itself was on the 1st floor with barred windows overlooking a ledge with all sorts of age old muck and grime, including a long dead bird. The bed was ancient, lumpy and totally uncomfortable and looked distinctly unclean. The wife wore more clothes to bed than when outside. The carpets were disgusting and horribly stained all over. All in all I would seriously recommend the closure of this place and a total rebuild carried out. Avoid like the Plague for youe own health.

<Content>Depends what you are looking for If what you need is a comfortable bed for a couple of nights in a great location and at a good price, then the Delta is ok. It is budget, it has a superb location, the staff were friendly and helpful, the breakfast ok, the bed linen clean and the beds comfortable. But the place needs a major overhaul (there were painters at work decorating when we were there, but you could not help feeling that a lick of paint was not what was required!). A wholescale refurbishment, new carpets etc might transform the place.This is NOT the hotel to choose for a romantic break or for a room in which to hang out. The room was tiny and dismal, the curtains hanging off the rail, the view non existent and the carpet old. There was a faint smell of urine constantly aorund the shower-room. And a smell of stale cigarette smoke hung around the room. But it depends on what the priorities are for your stay. OK but some problems about sums up our experience. But next time in Amsterdam I think we will look for another hotel!

<Content>Last Resort! It's been a few years... but I'll sum it up:When I first came in from Damrak, I noticed the lobby was bit funky smelling. When I checked in, I got hit with a 70e deposit (which was later given back at check out). It was a bit dim and somebody was passed out in the middle of the lobby.The room apppeared to be clean. I opened the curtains and my view was a brick wall and some trash strewn around the ground. The WC was decent and clean and there were towels. Very basic.I went out after a shower for some beers and food. When I came back later that night I was scolded by the front desk personel for not leaving my key with them.The ventilation in my room was quite poor and I couldn't sleep that well... i just sweated in bed all night... Check out was a easy enough...except having to make my way around about 50 dudes and their baggage through the tiny and stuffy lobby.Not exactly a honeymoon resort. The people hanging around the area just outside after 10pm are up to no good... go there with your buddy or alone for a quick stay and get the hell out. Central Station is very close...

<Content>loved the lcoation We had a great time mostly due to the fantastic location of the hotel, very central minutes from the red light district and tram stops just across the road.The hotel was very clean, the beds were comfy and the water for the shower was hot. The rooms we had were spacious.The staff on reception were very helpful, they recommended a restaurant Gouco's this is a great place to eat and is about 3 mins from the hotel, just ask reception for directions.The breakfast was good, hot and plenty of it.The location of the hotel is the biggest draw to this hotel, we went as a family with an age range of 19 - 70 so the location was brilliant within 1 minute we had shops, coffee shops, restaurants and bars.We would definately return to this hotel again. If your lucky enough to get a room at the front the view is great. You can sit and people watch.

<Content>what a dump We just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam.We stopped at the Delta with 3 x other couples, 2 of the couples were being bit by bed bugs. The breakfast was disgusting, everyhting was cold and had been sitting there from early morning until 10-00am. The rooms were dark and dismal even though they say it has been refurbished recently. The staff were pleasant and helpful and the only good point about the hotel was the shower was good. Do not stop here.

<Content>Watch out for the bed bugs! Budget should not mean dirty! This is my second stay in Amsterdam so I have something to compare with. Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else. The website says the hotel has been renovated but as the staff advised only the bathrooms have been done. The rooms are tiny, what I expected. The mattress is about 30 years old. I wanted to use the spare pillows in the room but when I saw them I would not let my dog sleep on them. I did not dare check under the pillowcases!We were a party of 4 couples in 4 rooms. Two of us were bitten all over the body by something. I challenged the reception staff and they said that they had tested for bugs 2 weeks before and were told they were clean. Coincedence, I think not.I accept that you get what you pay for, 218 euro for 2 nights but I think you will do better without any problem. While the breakfast is free, it is of little value if you cannot eat it.

<Content>Excellent Location! shame about the hotel! Stayed there for a friends birthday and all we wanted was a bed for the night in a good location and that is all it is. It was not perticularly cheap 230 Euros for 2 nights in a single room I think is steep for what it is. The single room I was in was tiny and I mean tiny, it was cleanish but could do with a refurb. The staff were very friendly.The breakfast was just about edible!Would I stay here again, NO!

<Content>Worst Hotel I have Ever Stayed In This review is long overdue (stayed at the Delta in summer 2003). This was hands down the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only positive I can think of is it's location, close to Centraal Station. The staff was uncaring, our room was not ready when promised, the room was depressingly dark and run-down. The bathroom was in desperate need of attention (loose fixtures, chipped tiles). The room's closet/wardrobe was dangerously close to falling apart. The door lock didn't work properly and we felt unsafe the entire night we stayed there. I would not rate the Delta Hotel even a one out of five.

<Content>You get what you pay for!!!! Nothing to Complain about!! Right, before i go any further the thing with this hotel and many others is that you get EXACTLY what you pay for!!! We payed 90 Euros per night for a double room for 2 persons - this works out at about 拢60 per night INCLUDING breakfast!! So if anyone can tell me were they would book an imaculate hotel in the centre of a european city ill apologise for my rant!! We arrived at the hotel at 11 in the morning - we were aware that we could not check in until 2 however the receptionist told us that we could lock our luggage in the store until we came back to check in at 2 so not to waste any time. We checked in and we were taken to our roiom on the 4th floor - the hotel is alot bigger than it looks!! Our room was quite dark and smallish the bathroom was big and the shower was like a jet wash!! We were traveling with another couple who were given a massive double room at the front of the hotel on the 2nd floor with big windows with views of the main street and a bath aswell as a shower!! We had a minor issue the first night as the water in the shower was luke warm and not warming out, we informed the receptionist who assured us that it would be fixed that evening and apologised. The water was fixed when we got in and when we went down for breakfast the receptionist checked that everything was working properly. The breakfast was brilliant value for money eat as much as you like choices of - Bacon,eggs, toast, jams, meats, cheases, bread rolls, bowls of fruit and cereals and various juices tea - all included in the price of the room served between 7 and 10! Was brilliant to fill you up till lunch! Their was a small down side - you wernt aloud to take food or drink up to the room with you - however we managed to on a few occasions!! The rooms were cleaned daily - the beds made and towels changed. We had a tv and safe in the room which was brill!! Overall we had no major problems with our stay and like i say you do pay for what you get - if you want 5 star luxury then pay for it!! Me and my boyfriend have just booked another trip to amsterdam between the 3rd and 7th december 2007 and we are staying in this hotel as it is only 280 euros for 4 nights!!! Thats only 拢195!!! feel free to contact me should you require any information!!!

<Content>Cheap, Cheerful, Well Located After reading some bad reviews of the Delta we were pleasantly surprised. We had a room for 9. Which was 9 single beds in a dorm style. We had one bathroom which contained a toilet and 2 showers and a sink. The bathroom was clean and hot water was available all day and it was very hot. We took our own towels following reviews on tripadvisor but we could have used the hotel towels as they were fine. The Hotel is about a five minute walk from the main amsterdam station - it is five minutes from the grasshopper. In reality It is 5 minutes from everything as it is centrally located.The hotel was very cheap at about 25 pounds per person per night. It was clean. Staff were helpful. Dont know what breakfast was like we never made it. Ideal hotel for young people sampling the culture.

<Content>Oh My God!!!! Me and four friends recently went for a weekend in the dam.We booked the Delta through a amsterdam based company.Upon arriving to the front desk at around 12 midday we were made to wait 20mins by the rude staff who totally ignored us.The 5 person room was more a loike a one man gas chamber!!!The room had an awful scent of what i can only describe as urine.Oh and more before we were given the key to our room we had to pay 26.50E each for T.V remote!! We complained 2days in a row to which there was no response.Day 2 was'nt much better either ..when by friend came back to the room saying he had just seen around 3-4 mice in a little doorway on the stairs.I couldnt believe it until i seen the state of the resurant that morning for breakfast.Stay away from this place unless you like flea bites

<Content>Double Duvet Scandal! Wish the reviews on Easy to Book had been as honest as we may have reconsidered staying at this hotel. The location is undisputedly ideal but the hotel description could start with Don't get your hopes up! followed by Shabby and scabby. We were stuck in an attic room (ironically referred to as the penthouse by receptionist) which was dingy, musky, no tea coffee facilities, a shower with no shower curtain and the water flooded the toilet. Sink in the bedroom rather than the toilet. Stains on carpets,walls, light fittings. Manky window that didn't close. Curtain that didn't cover the window. Having booked a double room we stupidly expected a double bed with double sheets etc. (how naive) We found two single sheets, two single duvets and cushions disguised as pillows on a double bed! When we had the impertinence to ask for a double duvet and sheets the receptionist said We don't have many. At 364 Euros for 3 nights we didn't think that a double duvet came only for business class. On the up side - the whole scenario provided much hilarity after we'd visited the local coffee shops! ( Laughter quickly disappeared on returning home and finding insect bites on my shoulder )Easy to book should take responsibility for advertising this place as a three star establishment. This hotel could easily be mistaken for a hostel but should reflect this in their prices.

<Content>Great location, central to everything. My Husband  I stayed 3 nights in the Delta Hotel in March 2007. We found the Hotel very basic but clean. There was 2single beds pushed together. Our bedroom was on the 4th floor facing the main street. While the scenery was lovely, we were looking out at the canal, there was plenty of noise from the main street. You could help yourself to as much of the buffet breakfast as you wanted. The Restaurant was always full during the day, so this was a good sign. We only eat our breakfast in the Hotel and we had one lunch there as there was plenty of lovely Restaurants nearby to choose from.A must is the 'Wok-to-walk', this is something you must have. It's just mouth watering  you will definately go more than once.The Hotel is very central. You could walk to a lot of tourist spots and there was plenty of good shops around us. The canal was beside our Hotel  a canal trip is a definite. The tram is outside the Hotel for going places also. Taxis are reasonable also. Very central Hotel. There are loads of pastry shops on all streets.The Heineken Museum is a very enjoyable day. The Heineken is lovely in Amsterdam, so cool, it's a must. There was lovely pubs nearby with very friendly staff.

<Content>A pleasant surprise Our party of 9 ranged from 15 to 70 years old, we had previously read reviews of this hotel and wondered why we had booked. Apart from a mix up with the booking which meant one of our party had to stay on her own in a single room everything was ok.We checked the mattresses immediately but found them to be quite new, the bed linen was crisp and white, the bathroom and towels were very clean. The carpet on the walls that was mentioned in a review was supposed to be a 'feature' and not hiding anything.The breakfast was plentiful and the restaurant that was open to the public was always full. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the only downfall was the stained carpets but then if you kept your shoes on or took slippers that was bearable.

<Content>Cheap As Chips Stayed for 3 nights at the Delta - paid around 拢60 and thought the hotel was more than worth the low price we paid. Rooms are very basic but was clean and tidy with safety deposit box in room. Hotel is ideally located right in the heart of Amsterdam 1 minute walk from Dam Square, with easy access to trams to get anywhere in the city such as Vondelpark or the Museum Square.The price also includes daily breakfast which is available until 10:30am on an all you can eat basis! I'd go for the continental breakfast option (Croissants, Juice etc) rather than the English breakfast as this was not that nice!

<Content>Fantastic hotel, staff great, position couldn't be better We were very pleasntly surprised by our stay at this hotel after reading some of the reviews. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make us welcome. Had a lovely room on the fourth floor overlooking street and canal. The noise from traffic was not a bother even with the window open. Breakfast was good choices and as much as you wanted. The bathrooms have been newly renovated and the room clean. Make sure you take a trip on the canals the best way of getting around. Would definitely go back there again and recomment it to anybody.

<Content>The Dirty Delta !!!!!!!!!! Do not ever consider staying at this dump.this is without question the worst hotel in the world.not fit for human habitation.its a disgrace that its still allowed to rip off tourists.when my wife complained about the condition of the room i.e.used condoms etc.the manager became very aggressive and when we cancelled our stay they refused to return the full monies they had deducted from our credit card.this is without doubt the worst hotel in amsterdam.it shoulsd be closed down immediatly as a health risk.take my advice dont even consider staying at this kip. I even complained to the dutch tourist office about this place.TouristBelfast

<Content>Cheap and Cheerful Just got back from a 3 night stay at The Delta Hotel Amsterdam. No complaints from me and my party. Six middle aged ladies from Liverpool. We had 3 twin rooms. Accommodation very basic but had everything we required. Don't expect luxury. All rooms quite dated but cleaned every day. Fresh towels supplied daily. Shower room very spacious (bit like a jet wash). Staff very friendly and breakfast really substantial (eat as much as you like). If you just want somewhere to get your head down after a hectic night in the town this hotel is ideal. Very central for all attractions. View from our window was a brick wall although my friends had a view of the main street. We were on the second floor. No noise at all from the street. Would go back to this hotel as it was cheap and friendly.

<Content>Hated it!!!!! When we arrived at the hotel the reception was lovely and clean but when we went around the corner to go up the stairs the smell started the place was filthy dirty I dont think the place has ever seen a hoover since it opened and the walls in the hall were rotten with dirt and blood all I could think I sope the room is not like this. I opened the room door and there was just enough room for the bed it was tiny and the carpet on the floor and yes the walls was rotten. The shower was tiny good job im a small person. Overall I did not enjoy my stay there at all. A bit of advice take your slippers or something if you want to walk from the bed to the shower oh and a pair of earplugs the noise at night is terrible.

<Content>gobsmacked Well how disappointed were we on opening the door to our room.The room looked nothing like the rooms advertised on the website. In fact we were given a tiny attic room, (Anne Franks room was larger!)The room had a small wardrobe that was broken. The lights by the bed didn't work.The towels had holes in them. The bathroom or washroom was moldy and the shower didn't work properly.One minute the water was running cold and the next you got scalded by boiling water.There was a gaping hole in the wall for ventilation through which I could see daylight.We left the hotel one morning to fly home having found that there was absolutely no hot or cold water in our room. We were told it would be a few minutes! After breakfast we returned to our room approximately an hour after speaking to reception about the water and there was still no water, we couldn't even brush our teeth or have a wash!We feel that we were misled by the photographs on the web site and the wording.Paying in advance which is also wrong as once you have paid there was no way of getting your money back or changing hotel. The rate was extortionate considering the condition of the room we were given.The only thing the Hotel had going for it was the location and the staff.

<Content>No Eating!! We got there and I was a bit surprised when they chrged our entire stay the moment we checked in. This way if you want to leave, you can't because you've already paid for your stay. The rooms were small and the bathroom primative. The worst part is when we got back to the hotel late with food and the door man told us we had to eat in the lobby because they don't allow food in the rooms because the cleaning crew did not want to clean uo the mess. NO FOOD IN THE ROOMS, IT'S AMSTERDAM!! I will NEVER stay there again.

<Content>Great Location, awful rooms We arrived in the reception which was ok but nothing special to be told our first night of 3 wasnt reserved for us but luckily they had a triple room we could have for this first night. Got to the room which looked clean but very basic with a few holes in the walls etc bathroom was clean but again basic. The problems started when we slept in the beds of which we were getting bitten by fleas, plus then the window just blew open on its own making the room freezing. We tried to close/lock the window but werent able to. The breakfast was ok with hot food as well as cold selection. We had our problems but as this is a cheap option I suppose you get what you pay for.

<Content>DNA all over sheets, towels and walls I thought it was a joke at first. we walked into a room with a bare mattress which had yellow stains all over it. The bath towels were all ripped with red stains on them. The cups by the sink had crusted white residue all over them. When we complained, they basically laughed at us. They would not let us cancel our other two nights, so we ended up having to stay in this horrible place.

<Content>Central hotel, easy access, my stay was okay Okay if you want a luxury hotel, where you want to stay in your room for the whole holiday this place aint for you, but somewhere to sleep is fine. Centrally located, easily found from the station. The receptionist was very friendly, we had breakfast once so I couldn't give you much a review, the one time I went it was okay, nothing special but if your hungry then it will set you up for the day. The the double room was pretty small but had everything, nice new bathroom, TV and safe, the only thing that put me off the room was the carpets, they were a worse for wear and stained in places which worried me a little, I ended up putting towels all over the place, they were replaced every day and the bed was made also. We stayed at the back which was quiet so perhaps if we had been at the front it might have been noiser but what do you expect in the middle of the city. Its okay, nothing special.

<Content>The Worst Hotel I've stayed in the whole year!!!!! After arriving at the Hotel, I realised I'd been given a two single bed room which was adequate at best. I'm not that fussy generally, but the place cost me about 拢125 a night. Was shabby, in need of repair and basic. When I went to sleep that night on a rock hard mattress and was bitten by Fleas or whatever was in the bed. The next morning I had no sleep, had massive lumps and bite marks all over my back (even my forehead) When I complained that night they didn't seem to care and I asked for another room. No better, but minus the fleas. I travel all over the world every week and have never stayed in a hotel this poor especially for the asking price. Oh and the only hotel I have ever stayed in that couldn't even supply me with an iron.I know I'm a business traveller, but as long as a place is clean I'm happy.Absolute DUMP. Tell people you don't like to stay there.

<Content>Last Resort I stayed only one night at this place. The room was clean at least. However, the air was stagnant and the halls were eerily quiet. I had to step over some guy passed out in the lobby on the way out. Ummm.. when I came back after a night at the Dampkring (go there!), I was scolded by the clerk for not dropping my key off before I left. My view way an alley full of garbage.Good location(before sunset). Go ONLY if you are in a jam and need a place to stay. Otherwise, you are talking a real chance. I love Holland, been there a million times, it's my second home. However, book a place that won't make you sleep with one eye open.

<Content>Better Than Expected Six Ladies aged 18 - 40ish went for a 40th Birthday. Having read the reviews after booking we expected the worst. The hotel is 5mins from station, main shopping area and bars. GREAT LOCATION. We found the rooms to be clean and tidy with towels changed every day. Breakfast was ok but the staff don't smile. The only downside was that because of its location it is very noisy all night. If you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location then stop here. We would go again and there are some fussy women in our party.

<Content>Very Disappointing!!! I have to say that if you are looking for an enjoyable stay in Amsterdam you would do well to steer well away form this hotel ( i use the term hotel very loosley). The bathrooms were terrible and the rooms were so much worse. Clean towels? Fresh bedsheets? these are just few of the things you will NOT find here.The only point worth mentioning is its location...it is ideally located near centraal station and other local amenities.

<Content>An absolute disgrace never again. We as a college group stayed in this hotel. There was 8 girls in a room and now imagine 8 girls in a room all getting ready at the one time to go out. To our suprise there was only 1 shower which i thought was a disgrace and to make matters worse you wouldnt call it a shower, i had to stand on my tip toes and lay against the wall to get nearer the shower and the water that was coming out of it would barely wash your face it was a disgrace. There was no bath. Our friends had baths. The hotel staff are very noisy and creepy. The Breakfast in the restuarant if you would call it that was not great. The only good thing about this hotel is its near everything such as the train station, trams and the red light. If i was to go back to amsterdam i would find a better hotel as this hotel was in my opinion a disgrace. It looked more like a hostel to me....

<Content>Ideal for stag Party Stayed here in June for my stag do and found the hotel better than expected after reading the reviews on this site. The hotel isn't the best I have stayed in but it was ideal for what we used it for.(sleeping,shower,getting dressed). Rooms are clean and it is in an idea llocation. 5 mins from train station and 5 mins from all bars and coffee shops. We had a great time and no problems with hotel what so ever.we was even allowed to leave our bags at the reception at 9.00am even though we couldn't check in till 1.pm. Hotel was a little more expensive than others but I didn't mind as it was in a good locaton!!!!!!

<Content>Great location, but thats about it.... After booking what I thought was a pretty good deal, I was horrified to see the latest reviews talking about fleas in the beds. I'd booked our trip as a surprise for my boyfriends 30th birthday and was getting really worried about our stay, anyway.... the staff were really friendly, the sheets and towels were clean, although they weren't changed while we were there I didn't think this was a problem for 3 nights. The view was awful (a brick wall) but the location more than made up for it, across the road from the 'coffee shops', the red light district and the main station we couldn't have asked for a better location. We only managed to get up for breakfast once, and we realised we hadn't missed much, OK if you like toast but don't bother with the English breakfast. I would recommend this hotel to people that aren't expecting to spend too much time in their hotel room, but do try to get a cheap deal as I felt it was over priced!

<Content>Not worth the money Don't book this hotel by what you see on the website as the pictures are very misleading. I hope you don't get Room 006 unless you like views of walls - there was a brick wall in the room and a brick wall 3 feet outside the window (in front and on both sides of the window). It was so dark that we had to have the light on whatever time of day it was. There were a pair of men's underpants outside the window and also a pair of jeans - both had been there some time. I did inform reception but not sure that anything will be done about it. We were also charged about an extra 40 Euros tax when we arrived on top of the price we were quoted - this came as a surprise to us.It is in no way a 3* hotel and I don't consider that 320+ Euros for 3 nights is cheap. The breakfast was poor and the staff were very slow replenishing dishes and cutlery. I was told one morning that I would have to wait 10 minutes for a cereal bowl as that's how long the machine takes to wash them!! The only plus is that the hotel is ideally situated for most attractions.

<Content>don't know what to say!!! stayed here for 2 nights at the end of may. location great, right outside everything- straight across the road from red light district etc!!! breakfast not so good, but for the price, can't really complain. did like the fact that when we checked out early, we could leave our luggage at no cost.- what i didn't like were the fleas that shared our bed!!- out of 4 people staying there, in 2 different rooms, all 4 of us had the great pleasure of returning with souvenirs of blisters that itched like mad. personally i received 5!!! to ask if i would stay there again??- don't think so- don't have that sort of thing back home- so why would i go somewhere that gives them when i have to pay for the privilidge!!!

<Content>Delta Hotel Stayed at the Delta Hotel for 3 nights and thank god we were out most of the time. Does not deserve its 3 star rating, more like a 1 star. No fridge, musty smell, beds only made 1 day. Did not go on holiday to make beds, can do that at home! Rooms very small. There was three in our room. Lighting very dull. Impossible to put on make up. One electric socket for drying our hair and it was no where near the mirror. Hotel not worth the money they ask.

<Content>Hated this Not as expected. Booked on Easy to Book as 3-star hotel. Surely not. Dirty entrance and lift. Lift works but slow. Men hanging around reception most of day. Quiet room, amazing on this busy street. Room v small, carpet stained, grout in bathroom dirty, ceiling leaked and stained and lumpy like something is growing under it, furniture badly chipped. Sink by the bed, toilet and shower through separate door, smelly, no real ventilation. The food was passable, tinned fruit, eggs but there were cats in the kitchen. Main problem was someone opened my door in the night. I left at 5.30 the next morning. The receptionist was rude and unhelpful and said she was going to charge for two nights because I was cancelling. It was not a cancellation, I moved because I felt unsafe. The person in charge only comes in on Tues. My advice, avoid this, I paid 100 E a night and it is definitey not worth it and in my opinion not safe.

<Content>A Pleasant Surprise We are a married couple both in our sixties and have travelled quite a bit, usually staying in moderately cheap places as this gives us scope to see more. We wanted a place centrally located because of mobility problems. Hotel Delta seemed to suit our needs so we booked a room for 3 nights. However when we read some of the reviews we had serious doubts. As it was for such a short time we thought we'd go anyway. On our arrival the receptionists were very polite  helpful,  spoke perfect English. The lift worked(thank goodness as we were on the 4th floor)  our room we found to be clean  adequate if basic. As we had found a very good deal with Easy to Book on line we decided the place was ideal. There was a brick wall as a view from the window but that didn't matter as we were out all day anyway. There is still some building equipment outside the lift for ongoing refurbishment but it wasn't in the way. The buffet breakfast was plentiful with a good selection served in the restaurant at street level. The food was so good we went back for lunch! What do these people who criticise want ? If they want excellence they should pay more. The only downside for us was we had some noisy inconsiderate young lads on our floor who shouted and slammed doors from about midnight till 3 am. That was not the fault of the hotel. We thought the hotel gave good value, good service and is ideally situated. We shall use it again on our next visit.

<Content>Terrible place, don't waste your money This is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in!! We have travelled all over the USA, most of Western Europe, all over the East coast of Australia, many places in India, and a few countries of Asia, from 5* to caravan parks, this still makes the 'grade' as one of the worst in terms of price-value proposition (paid on average with tax Eu125 per day for a triple, that's more than what I paid in Paris for a place near the Louvre!!). My observations:(1) Our triple room was furnished (or rather unfurnished) in the most basic manner (3 single beds, a TV, a table  chair, 2 side tables in a bare walled room)(2) The bathroom was a reasonable size but there was a noise every 3 or 4 mins from the wall, some kind of a water sound for all the 4 days we were there. There was a liquid soap dispenser at the basin, one in the bath, 3 towels (no hand towel, no floor towel), nothing else. Oh yes, one dead BIG cockroach which remained just under the toilet seat for all the days we were there.(3) First day, came back to see room not cleaned, bathroom not cleaned, towels not changed but too late in the night to get someone to come in as we just wanted to sleep.(4) Second day, told at the reception to make sure room done, but came back to see the same status. Went back to tell the reception before going out to dinner, were assured it would be done, but when we came back past 10pm, it was still undone. Begged for towels and got them.(5) Third day made a BIG noise and finally it did get done. But the cockroach remained where it had been!!! My advice, don't go there. It offers facilities like a hostel at prices of a good hotel. Its a rip off. Location is the only good thing about this place.

<Content>Damrak - its better than yours! This hotel was superb!The bathroom had just been refurbished, clean and tidy rooms, fab location, working if somewhat scary elevator (great when your room is on fourth floor!) and good breakfast.We did email ahead and requested a room at the front which i would recommended to anyone as you get to watch the world go by which is great when sampling the local fungi!

<Content>Only good for sleeping after visiting coffee shops When I stayed there by myself a few years ago, the bathroom was ok, clean sheets and lock on the door was all I needed. I fought a cockroach from picking off of my breakfast plate downstairs. In the night stand, there was a dirty sock and a small plastic bag left behind and I had the maid re-vacuum before I headed out to the coffee shops. He did anything that I asked and did it with a smile, a sincere smile. Plus, it helped that he spoke french (I was studying in France at the time) and not much english. It was close to the Red Light District and didn't have far to go back. I would stay there again because it was cheap and when I come back after being in the coffee shops and sight-seeing, I know everything was taken care of in the beginning.

<Content>Mice - What mice? We have just returned from another trip to Amsterdam (11th - 13th April). We are a group of English Ajax supporters and regularly pop over to Amsterdam for the matches, we also normally stay at the same hotel (the Frisco Inn).However on this occasion my friend was clicking around on the internet and came across a great deal for the Delta hotel through the EasyToBook[-] website.It worked out at around 拢25 each per night INCLUDING breakfast (our other hotel doesn't offer breakfast and we pay 45euro's - 拢31 per night).On this occasion three of us were staying there so I booked the triple room.No matter where I go I always read the reviews on Tripadvisor and after reading the reviews on the Delta hotel we had some serious resevations about staying here,especially reports of mice and cockroaches.But the deal was that good we went ahead.The Delta is virtually opposite our other hotel and is located right on the Damrak just a stones throw from Centraal station,the red light area and Dam square.On arrival we were greeted by the friendly reception staff who processed our booking.We were given the triple room (446) at the rear of the hotel on the fourth floor.When we arrived at the fourth floor we were met by a building site.They were refurbishing all the bedroom toilet/shower rooms and ours seemed to be the only one they had finished.There was boxes of tiles,bags of grouting,builders tools everywhere plus all the carpeting was covoured in sheets of paper.We were not too impressed at this point,however,on entering our room we were quietly surprised.It was very spacious with plenty of room around the beds,lots of storge space,a security safe and a television with free PORN channel!!The shower/toilet room, as expected was brand spanking new and was also quite big which was excellent.Water pressure was superb.If I had one grumble I wished the shower had been in an enclosed cubicle instead of being open plan.When you took a shower everything got wet plus if a mate wanted to use the loo he couldn't - unless he wanted a shower sitting on it!! Beds were comfy and all bed linen was clean.Our room had windows that ran full width of the room which let in plenty of light and all the windows opened for ventilation.Breakfast in the morning was the usual euro fair,scrambled eggs,bacon,beans plus breads and cheeses and cold meats etc.We had no complaints here at all.If there is one thing the hotel could really do with is a good clean up on the outside,it does look rather dirty. All-in-all we had a pleasant two night stay and for the money it was fantastic value and would definitely consider staying here again.I have given my rating a four star on the basis of value for money.Oh, I nearly forgot,we didn't see a mouse or any evidence of mice or cockroaches anywhere.

<Content>You Can't please all the people all the time... I booked this hotel due to the huge discounts offered by some web-sites prior to reading the reviews (something I never normally do).Some of the other reviews are DREADFULL! I therefore had a sense of dread at what to expect.I have to say that the hotel is a basic hotel, but for the price we paid it was great(90 quid for four nights each for a twin room)what more could you want!The location is superb; Central Station and Dam Square within sight, coffee shops bars, cinemas, restaurants etc (oh, and the ace chip shop next door!)all within very easy reach.The room was a good size on the ground floor, good sized bathroom, comfy beds, and even a safe (even though the safe was only attached to a flimsy wardrobe shelf, it still gave you a slight feeling of security!).At the end of the day, in Amsterdam if you don't sleep well at night after being out and about then there is something wrong with you! a mouse could have tap danced on my face most nights and I would have been oblivious! (see a previous review re: mice)I thought overall it was great, and would reccommend it to anyone purely on the price/location ratio.

<Content>Good times at the Delta The Delta hotel is right on the main strip extending from the train station. It is about a 2-5 min walk to get from the platform to the hotel. It's central location is excellent if you want to pick a direction to go in each day. Dam Square is right down the street and all of the best coffeeshops are right around the corner. We made Cafe 420 our home base, we were sure to check out everywhere, but always seemed to end up back there. We had a 3rd and 5th floor room both facing the street. Each room had one of the most memorable views of the city. Watch early in the morning for the Amstel Horse and Buggy, that is if you are able to get up that early. Probably not the best hotel for business purposes but definately great for those looking for a good time. Beware the elevator, it is only big enough for 1-2 people and their bags and even that is pushing it. Lean too hard on the wall and you can hear it touch the sides of the shaft. We took the stairs most of the time. I cannot wait to return to Amsterdam and the Delta Hotel, hopefully I'll see you there.

<Content>cheap and chherful. We stayed at the delta for 2 nights and on reading reviews i was ready to cancel. I'm glad i didn't, what rubbish people write. We arrived early and were allowed to store our bags whilst we explored city before checking in. room was clean and spacious, bathroom ok, shower very hot and powerful. Ok Breakfast wasn't great but tea and toast does for me. staff were helpful to every need and were polite. On the last day we wern't flying home till night and we were able to store our bags in the hotel until we were flying home. Excellent location, chip shop next door is amazin, best chips ever. The grasshopper coffee shop afacing is a good place to chill, the hot chocolates are great.overall this hotel is basic but clean. Its not luxury but for 拢80 for two nights what do you want?strongly recommend this hotel to people who want a good cheap base to explore from.

<Content>not the best-but not the worst! we stayed in the delta hotel for five nights in early feb 2006. between the 9 of us we had 3 rooms- 2 doubles and a 6 ppl room).our room (one of the doubles) had a huge bathroom but the room was quite small, the other double was tiny! the 6 was quite small, but it was cheap and thats what we expected.never mind- huge bonus is the location- 2 mins walk from central station and dam square and 30 seconds walk from the grasshoper-bonus! all in all we found all the reception staff (bar one-the night shift one) to be really friendly and helpful. they let us check in 2 nours early, also they let us store our luggage all day after we checked out. from the amount of ppl we saw walking around with cases all day everyday-trust me this isn't the norm!if you want a 3* hotel the delta isn't the place for you but it can't be beaten for location and was clean and comfortable. rooms are cleaned every day but are basic- i would return again!dont let the bad reviews put you off!

<Content>Should Not be a three star, great location though. How on earth the dutch tourist board awarded this hotel with a three star rating is beyond me! However, the hotel is clean and the beds are relatively comfy. Its quite good value for money, but certainly dont go expecting luxury!!! Staff are average, but location is excellent.

<Content>Stay Away, Stay well Clear!!! I spent 4 nights in this Hotel for a long weekend break. Here鈥檚 the breakdown:Day 1: Checked in the Hotel late Friday Evening, There will charge of 鈧?0 deposit (refundable after when you checked out) this is because you don't trash your hotel room etc. But I understood that. So far so good.Day 2: All hotels guest get free breakfast from 7:30am 鈥?10AM, which was not bad. During naptime, the heater was making an annoying whistling noise every few minutes. I couldn鈥檛 sleep. I went down to the reception  explained problem, they did not have any other rooms, so I had to live with it.Day 3: I was moved to another room, in the morning, at night, whilst I was a sleep, I got up to get some water, and to my surprise鈥︹€ saw 2 mice running around my room, I was shocked  disgusted. So I immediately went to the reception  explained the problem, they moved me straight away to another room (the deluxe suite). I was asked if I was eating in my room, I said no. They said to me I will have to move in the morning鈥︹€O NOT AGAIN!By the way no eating is allowed in your room!! No wonder!Day 4: That morning the manager apologised for what had happened, and it was OK for me to spend my final night in the Deluxe Suite.There were no problems during that night.During Check-Out, I got any apology from the staff, but I did not get any discounts or reductionsBad Points: - Mice, Noisy Heaters, Bad Showers.Good Points: - In a perfect location, 5 mins from Centraal Station, close to RLD, Dam Square etc, all pretty much in walking distance.I can鈥檛 say if I will every stay here again.

<Content>disgusting filthy rip off We were very happy to be going on a break to Amsterdam again after not going for 3 years and were very sadly disapointed when we got to this hotel we had booked over the internet. The photos of the rooms on the web site look great but trust me the room we were show to had no resemblence to the advert. The first room we were offered was very small and the bathroom was like a cupboard with broken tiles and black grouting, it had twin beds and my husband and I had booked a double, the nets at the windows were brown from smoking and it stunk. We went back to reception and asked for an upgrade and were taken to another room which did have a double bed but the curtains were also brown and the bathroom small and smelly again with broken tiles. There was no wardrobe in the room only an old broken chest of draws with a small TV on the top and a wooden chair to sit on so we had no where to put our suitcase or clothes. We again asked for another room but were told they were full and had no choice but to stay there. We decided to make the best of it and had a rest then went out for a meal and a walk we returned later and had a quick shower which to be fair was ok then went to bed. I got up around 3am to visit the toilet and opened the bathroom, put on the light and there was a huge cockroach sitting on the toilet seat and another one running across the floor to the pipes at the back of the loo. We got dressed and went downstairs to see the night manager who although did not speak English very well was very nice. He sent another guy who was working in the kitchens up stairs to get rid of them and he took of all things a can of Glade airfreshner with him, what for I will never know. He went into our bathroom, laughed and knocked the roach onto the floor and squished it, the other one had scarpered. We packed the few things we had taken out of the case and went down to reception to ask for a refund the guy who had diposed of the roach had returned to the kitchen with roach juice on his hands and shoes and carried on with out washing his hands (YUCK) We were told by the night manager he could not give us a refund and would have to wait for the day receptioist to arrive. We sat in the reception from 4am till she arrived at 8am and were told that we were dirty people and that we had bought the cockroaches in on out shoes, well forgive me but if I had a two inch bug on my shoe I think I would have noticed it. We left and went to the tourist board who booked us into the Crown Plaza American which was only 拢5 a night more than the roach motel. They told us the Delta was only suitable for back packers and young people and that they should not have 3* in their opinion they should be graded at 1+. All in all our 4 night much needed trip away form work, kids and housework turned into a bit of a nightmare and would definitely NOT NOT NOT be staying in this flee pit again.

<Content>Grotty Dirty, hot room. Took 3 days before they put a fan in the room. Windows opened inwards and you walked into them if you had to go to the toilet during the night. Carpet on the wall? Very strange. Grubby bathroom. Breakfast unusual, okay if you like eating off chipped plates and cups. Certainly not worthy of its 3 stars. Only good thing going for it is location. Have stayed in better 2 stars in Amsterdam. Only book this if its cheap and you're not fussy.

<Content>Don't laugh - this is our FAVORITE hotel! Jeez, I can't believe all these bad reviews are about my FAVORITE hotel in the world: The Delta Hotel (or as my wife calls it: the Delta House!). We have travelled happily to Amsterdam 7 times and have stayed at the Delta 5 of those times and wished we had the other 2 times. YES the lobby is small (who cares?) but the staff has ALWAYS been more than gracious (ie: making us food  drinks AFTER the restaurant has closed, watched our luggage and chatted cheerfully with us). Grant it, we ALWAYS stay in our favorite room(s) - in particular room 330 or ANY room with the small balcony. These balcony rooms face the Dam (AND we were warned that it can get noisy) but for two people they're HUGE with tall ceilings and, as I mentioned, two french doors that open to a balcony overlooking the Dam. We were able to enjoy the Christmas parade right outside our room (Black Peter even threw candy up to us!). Yeah, breakfast was basic but never cold and I have NEVER seen any mice or critters in our room and the showers/bathrooms seemed no different from any other hotel.This hotel has TONS of personality, sits next door to a killer french fry stand and is a 4 minute walk from central station. By the way, the hotel picture on the websites that shows the sign  the balconies: THAT'S ME STANDING ON THE BALCONY LOOKING OUT! Go to the Delta, just ask for a balcony room facing the street.

<Content>Dirty dive but close to station Very central, close to station and Dam square. You have to pay up frount for the loan of a TV remote. The room was small ( I dont really mind that as many are in Amsterdam) the room was dirty and the shower room disgusting, curtains were full of cig burn - not exactly classy but if your looking for a central hotel then this is for you.

<Content>Cheap n Cheerfull! After reading other reviews about this hotel, we considered cancelling and booking something else! But it was the location we were after which is fab for town and red light district. Went with two friends and had a triple room 4th floor. Room was neat and tidy nothing to write home about but for 拢75 a night in Amsterdam you cant really complain. No window in Bathroom did make it a bit smelly at times but you could open the bedroom window. Fan in room, nice little touch and the last nights guests stuff in the bedside table! Safe not screwed down in wardrobe so a bit pointless as you could take the whole thing! All in all fine if your main use of the place is to sleep, as for the noisy chippy it was always shut when we rolled home at 5am! Goes without saying, never saw breakfast!

<Content>Avoid at all costs Stayed here for a Stag Do. Rooms were OK, although one of our foursomes ended up with the attic room which wasn't fit for storage let alone accommodation. Admittedly, when another room became available they were moved. All was going OK until checkout, when they tried to sting us for phone calls we hadn't made and premium channels we hadn't watched. Needless to say, we refused to pay and they eventually waived the fees.Then, a month after checkout, a mysterious 拢150 charge appeared on my bank statement. They'd taken it upon themselves to debit my account for a tv we allegedly threw on the floor. Absolute rubbish. Currently trying to get this money back from them.In my opinion, although the accommodation was OK, and the location was good, I would never recommend to anyone I know staying here, as it might end up costing you a ----sight more than you bargained for !!

<Content>This place stinks! (Literally!) We stayed just one night in this hotel, and although we weren't expecting it to be brilliant as we read these reviews (after booking unfortunately), we weren't prepared for the smell! The actual public areas weren't too bad and everwhere seemed reasonably clean (apart from the windows), but when we walked into our small room, we noticed they had opened the window wide (luckily we had one). The room smelled of stale smoke and sweat. It was only when we opened the wardrobe we noticed a brown stained pillow at the bottom and in all honesty i have never smelt anything like it!!I joked that the pillows on the bed probably smelt the same, so we had a look and they were just as bad. The covers were clean, but i dread to think how old the pillows and quilt where. We actually slept on top of the bed, and used our clothes as pillows. Im no snob, but i couldn't bring myself to get in!I agree with the other reviews about the breakfast, edible, but the book Green Eggs and Ham springs to mind!I suppose this hotel is Ok for stag does etc, or if you're not fussey about were you sleep, but i wouldn't recommend it, and it certainly put a damper on our trip to Amsterdam. Luckily my husband and myself both have a good sense of humor, and i would say that this is a reqiurement of staying in this hotel!

<Content>Great for a group of Lads Stayed in the Delta in May for my stag night. It was cheap working out around 拢40 per head for a group of 14. If you want a hotel close to everything who will not bother you for having a laugh you will not beat this place. The rooms are not great but it is somewhere to put the head down.

<Content>Friendly staff Things seem to have improved at the hotel since the some of the other reviewers have stayed there. My biggest compliment is that after I left my wallet in the room they posted it back to me in England complete with money and all the cards.The hotel is in a great location and is relatively cheap. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast, especially the scrambled egg, was very mediocre, however. All in all, a decent place that isn't as bad as you've heard.

<Content>Poor quality We stayed 3 nights April/05. Room was tiny with the bed against one wall and 20 cms from the other.Light switch by the door-so to turn off have to walk in dark round corner, up step and climb into bottom of bed. No bedside light. on arrival 2 of the 3 lightbulbs in room were broken. In spite of having booked a total price with agency were ripped off to tune of 21.60 euros on leaving. Noisy at night,in scuffy area-chip shop next door. Room and hotel down at heel and dirty. I strongly suggest you stay elsewhere.

<Content>An absolute disgrace!! This joke of a hotel is an absolutely disgraceful rip off and makes a mockery of the Dutch health authorities and tourist inspectors. It's a mouse infested, idiot staffed, poorly managed (if there is one) hell hole.I would seriously warn anybody thinking of staying at the Delta Hotel to consider not only their safety but their health as mice were running freely in our room and mouse droppings are everywhere. The staff don't give a damn and a room maid said they are quite used to the mice. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!

<Content>not for the faint hearted Just come back from a 3 day hen party in Amsterdam. Did not expect the Ritz for the price we paid and our quad bedroom(apart from damp in bathroom) was adequate and clean enough but some other party members had horrific rooms with little or no windows in them and litter scattered around the place. The attitude of the staff is to say the least downright ignorrant it doesn't get you anywhere when you complain because they couldn't care less about you. We didn't spend much time in the hotel so get what you pay for I guess but would not reccommend this hotel to anyone even my enemies! Some customer care wouldn't go amiss with the so called manager. Wouldn't last 5 minutes in this country!

<Content>Great location and good as a base I stayed here a couple of years ago but recent reviews suggest not a lot has changed for the better (or indeed the worst).This hotel is perfect for those who want a base in the city centre, close to the train station, who just want somewhere to sleep in between exploring the city.My room was clean, comfortable with good bathroom facilities. The staff were friendly and gave me some good advise when my wallet was pickpocketed in the city - they even let me use their phone to call home (overseas remember) to cancel my credit cards etc. Luckily I had left most of my money in the very handy room safe.Not a place to go with family but for a good value, central hotel for those who are going to spend very little time in their room, it's great.simonwilding@aol.comipswich UK

<Content>Great position! We stayed in the Delta from the 10 - 13th Feb 2005. We where on the 5th floor which meant 5 flights of stairs to get to our room 554, there was a lift though if needed. The room was average more like a dorm than a hotel room 4 beds, table with mirror and a tv, the room was quite small for four people, but it was clean and tidy. The bathroom was simple but there was some mould on the ceiling, and a big wire sticking out of the wall ohh and no mirror which was a real problem for shaving if you did not bring your own mirror. The hotel is perfectly situated, just a stones throw from everything, you can not beat this hotel for its position in amsterdam. The reception staff where friendly enough.*I would not recommend a family stay at the Delta Hotel, it would simply cause problems.*Ideal for a few lads.*You will be asked for a 40euro deposit for the door keycard and tv remote, but you do get this back at the end of your stay.*This is not a 3star hotel.*For the price we paid it was fair.

<Content>Never again!!!! Stayed 15-17 January 2005 inclusively. Cramped tiny lobby, breakfast - scrambled egg, bacon and beans, all cold! Rubbish and litter in the corridors. Noisy and overall very dirty hotel. These are the good points. If you are thinking of booking for this hotel, do yourself a favour - DONT! Look elsewhere.

<Content>Fantastic location - not bad VFM I cant believe what I have read about this hotel. OK, the entrance / lobby are small, but the room we had was more than adequate. Clean, clean towels and bed linin every day, and very comfortable. We stayed there for 4 nights in Oct 2004, and found it a very useful base to explore the city. Its reasonably priced (we paid Euro415 including a Fri night), and I dont beilieve anything more can be expected, if all you need is somewhere to wash and sleep. Breakfast was more than adequate (hot buffet, all you can eat). Didn't try the restaurant at night so can't comment on that.All in all, I would recommend it to anyone

<Content>Don't even THINK about it!!! We stayed at this hotel per the 3 star rating and it was not 3 star by any means. All the reviews that mention how the hotel staff are not very helpful is right on. We went in Sept 04 and were booked to stay 3 nights. The first nite we got in late and tryed to stay out late because I was scared of the room. Dirty, SMALL, our room was on the first floor in the back and was tiny, looked like a cell. The bathroom was small and there was no way I could use that shower. Floor was very dirty, sheets  blankets probably weren't regularly washed, if at all. The next morning we went and found another hotel straight away that was about the same price and much nicer!!! They are out there. Next time I travel I will for SURE read reviews. After looking and finding a new place we went back to our room to get our belongings and there was one of the staff in there, that looked like some kid off the street! No uniforms or name tags, at least I hope they were with the staff. Luckily we got out as soon as we could after one night of almost no sleep because of being creeped out by the whole experience. I didn't feel safe for myself OR my belongings, even with the dumb safe! My boyfriend said we should have taken a picture of the room and I told him 'We don't want to remember this room or experience. Funny now ... awful then! Happy travels and no Delta Hotel...

<Content>"Oh no. This can't be happening!" We arrived at the Delta on 4 December. The entry way off the main street is the first clue that their web site has stretched the truth a bit. If you're expecting a grand entrance with welcome host, think again. You enter into a small, cramped lobby where you sign in. By the way, prepare to leave a deposit for the TV remote and to pay cash for the room taxes due when you check out. After check in, we made our way to our fifth floor room, partially with elevator and climbing stairs the rest of the way. Standing at the door, we felt like we were entering a cabin in a submarine. It was dark and small. When we pushed the door open, it was shocking. Mind you, I've traveled extensively on business for 25+ years, throughout the US, Europe, Canada and Mexico. This was the worst first-impression ever. The first thing that ran through my mind was, It's only for one night. To make a long story short, shabby carpet, extremely small room, funny smell, mildew on the shower curtain, flimsy walls and door, all for $169US based on the current exchange rate. We booked this based on their web site. Don't be fooled. Avoid this place at all costs.

<Content>Don't book until you've read the reviews!!! This is the one of the worst, sorry no, THE WORST hotel I have ever stayed in, room was small, smelly, dirty and cramped. the sheets I hope had been washed but didn't look like it, we slept on top of the sheets and put out T-Shirts over the pillows to be on the safe side. The carpet was filthy with stains all over, not once did I let my feet or any part of my skin touch it!!!It has all the basic facilities of a 3* hotel, bathroom, TV, telephone, hairdryer, safe etc. but I would rather stay in a clean 1* hotel without any of these items. Amsterdam is great but this Hotel lets Amsterdam down, their tourist board / health inspectors should seriously take a look!!!You get what you pay for ................NOT IN THIS CASE.

<Content>The hotel from hell DELTA HOTEL AMSTERDAMdeserves no stars- This is dreadful hotel,rude staff,chipped dishes,and generally dirty. We had our room broken into all valuables stolen, no help from staff, sent to wrong police station at 11pm and on return at 12.45pm were expected to sleep in same room which could no longer be secured. We paid 7 nights up front and this was day 2 we demanded our money back and received nothing but lies from staff who absolutely could not care less about the way we were being treated. the room had been previously broken into as old repairs were visible. It took us till 10.30 next day to finally get our money and left.Iwould advise all to never stay in this hotel, it is very unsafe the safety deposit box in room could be carried under arm and taken out with you. a total farse. A horrible dirty unpleasant place to stay.

<Content>Money grabbers that provide terrible service. Yet another case of a nice family run Dutch hotel selling out to Mediterainians or North Africans.Stayed there many times in the past, got nice rooms and pleasant service at a reasonable price.Not anymore..the toilet seat was lying on the floor, the tv didnt work, neither did the phone.Room was filthy, so were the bed cloths. When they did eventually get the phone to work, had to pay 25 e. up front. The seat was never mended and all you got from the front desk was, maybe tomorrow.!Maybe tomorrow Ill stay there again.But I very much doubt it.

<Content>Good breakfast, shame about the shower. The Delta Hotel is in the perfect location, 5 minutes walk from the train station and in the centre of Amsterdam. The hotel could do with a bit of a clean but the rooms are adequete. Our room was at the back of the hotel and was quiet despite the noise outside from the terrible Teaser Bar (over priced and rude managment...... thats another story!) The staff are friendly and breakfast was yummy! Our only complaint was the shower in our room. On several occasions we had to shower in cold water and twice we had no water at all, mmm nice...! Our advice is to get up early for a warmish shower and not to expect too much, its somewhere to sleep and somewhere that doesnt charge 50euro's to poo!

<Content>friendly nice hotel I stayed in the delta hotel for 5 nights and found the staff happy, friendly and helpful. There were a few probelms but all were sorted out as soon as possible and we were all given free complimentry drinks in the hotel bar. The room was nice with a spacious bathroom and small balcony. The room admittedly wasn't luxery but was more than fairly priced and included a breakfast and a discount on food purchased from the hotel restaraunt.i read a few bad reviews for the delta and i would like to say that my experience was nothing like that. Its a well situated, affordable, comfortable hotel full of friendly helpful staff that were always willing to have a chat or help if asked too.i would defently recommend this hotel for your stay in amsterdam

<Content>Cheap  Hardly the Ritz, but not bad considering what you're paying. Try not to get a room on the top floor though (which is probably what you will get if you book a package with a tour operator) as you may end up having to do contortions to get in the bath - or even worse, the bed. A fabulous location from which to explore the city.

<Content>Mice in Amsterdam! Watch out for the mice!!!....at the Delta Hotel in the centre of Amsterdam. I stayed in room 552 on the top floor. A very sleepless night - my boyfriend was kept awake by the loud generator outside our room and I was kept awake by the mice crawling in my suitcase and eating my snacks!!We told the staff the next morning (complaints in the middle of the night about the noise were answered by a very large shrug of the shoulders!) and were told - what did we expect - there are mice in Amsterdam and they are in all rooms!Having said that we were then moved to room 331 which was fine and no friendly visitors in the middle of the night!
