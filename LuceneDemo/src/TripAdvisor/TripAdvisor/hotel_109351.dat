<Content>Make sure where your room is at and bottersome maids I love the marriot, dont get me wrong and I LOVE the pools but this place had some annoying factors.At one marriot my original room had a broken airconditioner and I was placed in another, I didnt complain b/c i wasnt double charged and it still came with a bed.First, the pros; Manager was nice, pool was great,*heated* comphy bed, good food, I like those mini coffee pots, nice location...of the hotel.Now the cons, the maids. ALWAYS the maids. =S Heres my story, I drove SEVERAL hours and was beat. I was on the 3 or 4th floor faceing the lobby, where they set up breakfast. How do I know? Well, the Noise, noise NOISE.At the crack of dawn as employees would make themselves know that they were setting up breakfast b/c I can hear it LOUD and clear.I didnt complain b/c they were just doing their job....in a LOUD way. So I lost several hours of sleep after I was dead beat tired from the long drive.The next con was, on the day of checkout, being at noon*forgot* trying to get as many minutes left on sleep, at 7something am the MAID unlocked my door, Didnt announce herself, ENTER MY ROOM, TURN THE LIGHTS ON and say 'oops. when she realize I was still there.I said to her, I found out later she didnt speak english, I have sevarl hours in this room left. I always put everything together before the checkout day so I can rest, washup and leave w/o worrying about anything else.But back to my story, She leaves and I look at the clock, the time being close to 8am, checkout at noon/or 11, one of the two. I try to sleep through the workers making noise with the dishes downstairs and 30 minutes later, the maid walks in, turns the lights on, yanks my sheets off and says 'oops' and walks out.I put the do not disturb sign up and try to fall asleep.40 minutes later, she opens the door AGAIN!! Turns the lights on and realizes Im there and says 'you no go?No, you go. She did and guess what, she does it again. It was rediculous so I call downstairs and complain about the lady. I cant sleep now since people are laughing and talking excessively loud and I go to wash up.I come out of the bathroom and shes back in my room pulling the sheets off my bed.I complained downstairs and they were nice to give me a free stay, though I would of liked my money back. Still, they were nice about it.Just be sure to know where your room is at and...heads up on the maids.

<Content>Wonderful Thanksgiving Get-Away This is a very comfortable Marriott Courtyard that is an excellent value for the money. The staff was wonderful as was the location. It is right next to the Central Expressway in Dallas, but not at all noisy. The room was absolutely clean, the beds were wonderful, and the bathroom totally spotless. The breakfast was extra, but also an excellent value for the money with plenty of choices (service or buffet, as you like it). it was easy to get around because of the proximity to shopping, restaurants and the art district. My husband and I had a totally relaxing Thanksgiving vacation. Thank you Marriott!!

<Content>Convenient Location  Spent two nites recently at this property and it's in a convenient location. Just a little north of Northpark Center on 75 and not far from Greenville. Within about 10 minutes of Uptown and downtown without traffic. Fairly simple lodge without any frills. Has a morning breakfast buffett for about $9.95 I believe. Parking lot gets busy in the evening since the property shares a joint parking lot with Marriott's Residence Inn. The property has a pool, spa, and gym; however I didnt use any of those services. I had a first floor room which had an antique am/fm clock radio that looked like it was from the early 80's.. The a/c worked fine as well as the water temp and water pressure. Towels were fairly comfortable/soft for a lodge in the class of a Courtyard.. The one downside was for some reason the remote and tv were not interacting. The remote was working since it was blinking however I had absolutely no response from the TV so it was inconvenient.. And the tv was an older 19 tube tv. Oh, and no vending machine on the property. A simple desktop was in the lobby to access the internet and print. Overall, the staff was friendly.

<Content>Great value  I stayed there for business for 2 nights and was very impressed. The new Marriott marketplace in the lobby was a bit meager but it was an easy way to get snacks and drinks inside the hotel regardless of the hour of day.The breakfast buffet was great, and well-priced at $9.95, and the computer kiosk in the lobby made it easy to print out my boarding pass. My only complaint would be that the front desk was difficult to contact when I called down there a few times. I suppose they were busy, but there was no phone operator so the phone would keep ringing.The beds were incredibly comfortable and the work space was ample. I would 100% recommend this to business travelers because it's close to a few restaurants you can walk to, and easily accessible by cab to the nearby business districts.

<Content>Great for the price I gave the Courtyard a rating of 4, but that's considering the hotel in the context of its price and location.The room was fine, although someone must have slept on a really awful bed to rave about the Courtyard's beds; they're average. Actually, average pretty much describes the Courtyard. There's nothing surprising or particularly nice about this hotel. The rooms are very clean and nicely sized, but that's what I'd expect. The positive exception to its average character is the staff. The desk staff are above average in speedily getting you through check-in and check-out, and the cleaning staff are unobtrusive and very competent. The bathroom items supplied are below average. You probably want to bring your own body lotion, shampoo  conditioner.However, for $109 a night without breakfast at a hotel so conveniently located, average is pretty good.

<Content>Great for visits to SMU I was in town for a conference at SMU and chose this property for its close proximity to the campus and because of my loyalty to Marriott; I was not disappointed.I was traveling with a group of about 15 colleagues and the hotel shuttle made multiple trips to get all of us and our luggage to SMU, definitely above and beyond the call of duty.Just behind the hotel is a great tasting authentic mexican restaurant, definitely give it a try.If business takes me back to SMU, I will stay again. For tourist attractions however, its not very close to downtown Dallas.

<Content>Great place, great service, great value I have stayed in this hotel twice over the past six months for SMU-related events, most recently last Friday. This hotel is an exceptional value.Pros: The staff is helpful and friendly. For both stays, they helped by providing a quiet room facing away from the highway.The king-sized bed is PERFECT. I want one at home. The Courtyard commercials brag about their new beds, and I must agree - these beds are quite nicer than those at higher-priced hotels in the vicinity (I'm looking at you, Embassy Suites).Two words: Free. Internet. So many hotels have sketchy scammish Internet stories, and this low-priced hotel delivers broadband with no charge, no gimmicks. Sweet.The location is close to SMU, which was great for my needs. It's probably close to other stuff too, but I don't know Dallas that well.Free breakfast. Haven't gotten to eat it, but good to know.Finally, price. I think I paid $80-90. For this neighborhood, that price is ridiculously low.Cons:Can't think of much, but the room has some noise with people passing by. This is going to happen in a non-suite situation, and it wasn't a problem for me.Overall:I would stay again. I probably will stay again.

<Content>Great Staff! I stayed at the Dallas Northpark Courtyard over the holidays, and the staff was great. I could not have asked to stay anywhere else and I WILL stay there the next time i'm in Dallas.
