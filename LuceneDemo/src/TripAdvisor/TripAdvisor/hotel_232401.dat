<Content>Had a fabulous break After reading the reviews of this hotel to say I was apprehensive towards staying here was an understatement!!!!!However when we arrived we were more than pleasently surprised!!The reception staff were extremly friendly and more than helpful.Our room although a bit on the small side was clean and well presented. The shower and toilet were also cleaned to a very high standard!Im not sure of others expectations of a 3 star hotel but this more than met ours.The hotel is in a quieter part of the city but is very close to the city centre about a 20min walk or 10 mins on the tram (no 1)There are also some very good and reasonably priced resturants in the vicinity.Overall we have had an excellent time

<Content>Could do better.... Stayed over UK half term October holiday. Not a good start, two rooms booked next to reach other and we were initially offered on different floors. Eventually resolved. Rooms clean, loads of hot water. Double room seriously small, shower leaked. The twin room next door was much bigger and better.Public areas not kept clean. No secure luggage store which in this day and age beggars belief. Breakfast at best ok.There are much better hotels in Amsterdam and particularly in the area which has major plus points rather than closer to the city centre which is 20 minutes walk or a short tram ride, number 1.

<Content>Stinks!!! Just arrived back from a weekend in Amsterdam where we stayed at the Europa 92 hotel. When we first got in to room the window was open. Since the weather was very cold we shut the window, soon we understood why it was open. Room and the bathroom was smelling like a public WC. So windows remained open during our two days stay. There were cigarette ends under the table and they stayed there as long as we stayed there. Shower cabin was very unclean, that I won't give more detail for not being disgusting. We paid 250 Euros for two nights stay and I'm sure there were much better hotels that we could stay with this amount of money. Yes, the location is great but still, I advise anyone to stay there.

<Content>not as bad as i imagined reading all the reviews, i arrived expecting the worst. the first thing i would say is that wheb booking a budget hotel like this you've got to be mindful that you generally get exactly what you pay for. i arrived extremely early at 9am but the staff were superb and allocated me my room straight away. all the staff were extemely polite at all times and very helpful. i had booked a single room and assumed i would get a twin room because no hotels have single rooms these days right? no, here they have single rooms. when i entered the room i realised that cat swinging was not a national sport in holland (however every other kind of swinging is catered for in the nearby red light district). the room although small and smelling of stale cigarette smoke was spotlessly clean. as were the sheets and bathroom. bathroom had a corner shower and the usual stuff. all was good. the bed was mongst the most comfortable i have ever slept in. breakfast was sparse and i would have expected some eggs for nine euro. however, there was the usual cheeses and bread etc. sufficient to kick start the day. as for location- pretty good. far enough away from town to be out of the tourist infested rld and suchlike, but close enough to get there in one five minute tram ride. it is in a great neighbourhood close to the famous vondelspark and musuems. pay per view has the usual selection of german documentaries and porn. i even saw the same horse in a documentary and a porn film. anyways, all in all, if you arent expecting the hilton and you dont mind hearing the guy in the room next door playing the banjo in the shower then this is the place for you. cheap and cheerful.

<Content>not worth its stars the hotel is not deserving of its 3 stars. The room which we stayed in was meant to be a honeymoon suite which was shocking. The bathroon had a leaking roof not to mention the hazadous situation a guest could be faced with as the roof was leaking onto a blowdryer. Fortunatley we detected this before using the hair dryer. However if the rooms were cleaned everyday as expected from a hotel with a 3 star rating and not merely cleaned by way of a change of new towels everyday or once we had checked out after 7 days, the leaking roof would have been detected.Needless to say our rooms were situated directly next to the staff toilets which we were fortunate enough to hear flush when we occupied the room. We would not recommend spending unnecessary money on the breakfast offered by the hotel as it merely comprises of pre-packaged products which are conveniently laid out directly from the packaging.If this were a 2 star hotel the above-mentinoed would be acceptable

<Content>Good, no frills Amsterdam hotel THIS IS NOT A MANAGEMENT RESPONSE:The Europa '92 is good value - I paid 80 Euros a night for a single, which included breakfast. Mostly frequented by Europeans the Europa's location is fine - not smack in the middle of the pictureque canal district but only a fifteen minute walk from it (which would account for the reasonable price). The hotel is clean (it's a clean country after all) and if you get a room in back then it's very quiet - which is a blessing. Friendly enough staff, internet place around the corner and some perfectly respectable restaurants in the immediate neighborhood. You can rent a bike at the friendly dutchbikes.com five minutes away and have a fine Amsterdam time of it. A couple of reservations about the hotel: the internet service is expensive (12 Euros for 24 hours) and not very powerful; also you can get a very very very small single if you don't watch out.

<Content>the hotel was above expectation after reading the reviews i was a little anxious on staying here ....however from the moment we arrived we were met with friendly helpful members of staff who made us feel welcome and responded to our request of more pillows straight away . breakfast was fresh and although typically continental, there were four cereals with fresh fruit and yoguart, choice of breads or rolls with a number of meats and cheeses with spreads and jams . you also had a choice of a pot of tea or coffee . we were situated at the front of the house , and of course it would be noisy ... after all you are in the central of amsterdam !!!!! we would definatly use this hotel again and if i were to change anything , it would be to put tea making facillaties in the rooms at a small charge maybe for the deposite for the kettle .

<Content>Pretty average I stayed at the hotel a few weeks back, the location as mentioned by other reviewers is good, everything is either a short walk or you'd have to catch a nearby tram, which is still pretty good. If you are in Amsterdam for just a stopover it's great, but be warned the room we had (twin room) was the smallest room I have ever stayed in. There was only room to walk around your bed, I am not kidding it is extremely cramped, especially if you are staying with a friend and not a partner. In fact from what I saw the entire hotel looks rather cramped, the lift will only fit two people with one piece of baggage each, and the steps are tiny, you can fall over if you rush. If you are a plus size person give this hotel a miss if you intend staying for longer than one night. Other negative aspects for me was that there was no airport shuttle, I couldn't find any aircon in the room (although it's a mentioned feature) and the breakfast was disappointing. If you are used to eating a cold breakfast no worries but if you are expecting a continental English breakfast you would be disappointed. The positive aspects of the hotel was the location, the staff were somewhat friendly and the room was extremely clean, especially the bathroom. I think the immaculate condition of the room is what has raised it to the 3 star rating.Overall I would say that the negative aspects can be forgiven because location and cleanliness for me is more important.If you catch a taxi, don't mind the size and are prepared to have a tiny breakfast than your stay at Europa 92 would be great. It's quite affordable for a hotel in this location in Amsterdam.

<Content>Just a toursit hotel Haven't stayed at hotel myself but booked a single room so I can share general impressions. Right near hotel there is tram stop 1 that can take you to the center. Leidseplein (bars restaurants - 10 min walking) museummplein is also not too far away. Room was very small but clean. I'd say this hotel has 2,5 stars and is good if there are no very special offers in better hotels.

<Content>A what you see is what you get Hotel After reading the mixed reviews the hotel received we had in fact a very pleasant stay in this hotel. We booked this hotel as part of a 6 night stay package deal, so price wise I don't know what the actual cost of staying here was. We arrived on the 29th Dec and had no problems checking in, the receptionist also gave us a 5 min quick brief on the local area.We had requested a double room but on arrival we had in fact been allocated a twin room, which in hindsight was probably better given the room size, also it was at the back of the hotel facing the garden which was nice and quite apart from the noise of fireworks going off . The room itself was on the 3rd floor and if we used the lift ( which states it can take 4 people or 300kg ~ 2 people is about right ) we then had to climb down some steepish stairs to reach our room. The room itself was okay in size, the twin beds butted together , dressing table, bedside tables, 2 chairs, table and a tv ( Only CNN was in English~ extra channels at a cost) . The bathroom was on the small size, but stylish, completely tiled , and had an enclosed shower. The room was fresh and clean, the beds were comfy and fresh clean sheets and fresh towels were supplied every day, including New Years Day although i,m not sure if the rooms were cleaned. My only complaint regarding the room is that we requested extra pillows after the first night (only 1 soft pillow is allocated to each bed) only to be told that the hotel is fully booked and there is no spare pillows, we asked again every other day only to be given the same answer, i thought a hotel this size would have extra linen, pillows etc available.The Reception was open 24hrs and we found the staff to busy doing reception and other duties to be friendly,chatty but in saying that they were very helpful when asked( Except if you'e asking for pillows) . The night receptionist got to know you and had your key available for you without asking for it .The bar was next to the reception area and was covered by whoever was on reception duty, it was small, reasonable priced, just ideal for that nightcap.Breakfast was typically continental with assorted cereals, fresh breads, ham, cheese, jams etc... orange juice and hot drinks, although for some reason the tea was warm rather than hot and that was without the milk being added,and on a couple of occasions we had to ask for the meat platter to be refilled. The location of the hotel was excellant, a No 1 Tram from Central Station stopped 50 yards from the hotel in the next street ( Cost 1.60 Euro).To Leidesplein square it was 5mins max as was the designer shops which is located in Hoofenstraft . the Van Gogh and the Riksmuseum are also 10 mins from the hotel and Dam Square 15 mins walking. The only downside regarding the Europa as like any other small Amsterdam hotels is that there not really disability friendly in the number of stairs encountered and access areas.Although i,ve highlighted a few negative points this hotel is a good, clean hotel , I would not have any problem in returning to this hotel in future,or recommending it to anyone going to Amsterdam

<Content>Very Pleased, Good Hotel ,Great Location After reading the reviews we were very pleased with our stay in this hotel. We booked it on another website as it offered a reasonable price and requested a quiet room. We arrived 30th Dec at 11am and had no problems checking in so early. As requested they gave us a room overlooking the garden, so apart from the noise of fireworks going off , we had no noise at all from the traffic.The room itself was on the 4th floor (rm 27) and was indeed quite small. Basically when the door was opened, you were into the room and faced with the large bed, dressing table, bedside tables, 2 chairs and a tv. The bathroom was a good size, completely tiled ,with both a bath (ideal for soaking in, after a long day of sightseeing) and a shower. The room was fresh and clean, the bed extremely comfy and we were given fresh, soft towels everyday, including New Years Day! As I said, the room was small and would not have been suitable for a large or disabled person.The Reception was open 24hrs and we found all the staff ( and cat) to be very friendly. After the first day , we didn't need to ask for our room key as the guy would have it ready for us as soon as we walked into the hotel. Breakfast was typically Dutch with assorted cereals, fresh breads, ham, cheese, jams etc... orange juice and the usual hot drinks.The location of the hotel couldn't have been better, a short walk to the Leidesplein square, 5mins to PC Hoofenstraft ( the posh shops) and 10 mins to the museums. We got a taxi from Central Station (11 euros) but the remainder of the trip we walked everywhere. The staff organised for a taxi to take us straight to the airport to catch our early morning flight and he was there early for us.A good, clean hotel (with very comfortable beds!) and nothing to complain about.

<Content>Great value for money After having read some of the reviews posted after I booked this hotel I was slightly worried but I am pleased to say that the hotel was clean and in a great location for reaching the Leidesplein (approx. 7 min walk). It is quite basic and it is not a modern hotel but this did not matter as we only wanted somewhere to sleep and spend a minmal amount of time in during the day. There is a nice garden that would be lovely in Summer time at the back of the hotel.Breakfast was included in our booking and consisted of cereal, bread, cheese and meat mainly. I was pleased with the standard of cleanliness and with the customer service that I received and it was excellent value for money. I would definitely return here.

<Content>Good Location I visited here with my partner and his family to celebrate his 30th birthday. On arrival to the hotel i was a bit worried as to what to expect when i opened my bedroom door (especially after walking up what felt like Mount Everest to get to it), however i was surprised. It may not look much but it was clean, the bed was comfy, there was plenty of hot water and you could control the heating within the room which is very handy when you are a cold blooded person. We were located to the front of the building where there was quite a bit of noise from the road outside however after visiting a few cafes each day i managed to sleep through it!!! One member of our party asked to change her room as it was too noisy and the staff were very quick to arrange this. Our room was quite small however the other two rooms were much larger, i think they may have been suite rooms. The hotel is a bit of a maze with lots of stairs. There is a lift should you wish to use it, it looked a bit antiquated to me.The hotel provided a continental breakfast which was adequate and the service received from the staff was satisfactory. The hotel is in a great location, from Amsterdam Central we took Number 1 tram which stopped just over the road from the hotel. The hotel is only a short walk from Leidsinplein Square and is extremly close to Van Gough Museum etc.I could only make one request to the hotel and that is to sell crisps, sweets i.e munchies, behind the bar for those midnight munchies and not be offered a small machine which dispenses handfuls of nuts!!! Thankfully there was a small shop still open at 1.00am just along from the hotel which was able to fulfill my needs.Overall our stay at the hotel was sufficient, we paid very little and i think it was great value for money. I would like to point out that i have high cleanliness standards and this hotel almost met my standards, i only noticed a couple of things which could have been better.

<Content>Awesome experience at Europa 92 We just returned from a stay at Europa 92 and I must say I was very pleasantly suprised. The location was wonderful and the accomadations were extremely comfortable. The owner and his staff were very gracious hosts. I would return anytime. We particularly loved the beautiful garden with a lovely mural painted by the staff.

<Content>Great Locaton  Just arrived back from a weekend in Amsterdam where we stayed at the Europa 92 hotel.After seeing some of the negative reviews on this site, I decided to write a reply.The hotel is in a fab area, only 3 mins walk to the Leidesplein area which has all of the cafes/bars and restaurants.The hotel is situated on a busy street, but it didnt disturb my sleep, and ultimately when you are in a city centre location, you have got to expect some noise.There is a nice bar area and a lovely terrace, which was great for a night cap (or two) before bedtime.Breakfast consisted of fresh bread rolls, ham, cheese, eggs etc, along with fresh orange and coffee.. absoluately no complaints about that.The staff were very friendly and helpful, in fact they couldnt have done enough for us.The rooms were basic, but clean, decent size bathrooms. My friend and I had booked two single rooms and they were more than adequate for a weekend break in the city. We paid 鈧?75 Euros each (拢60 a night) including breakfast and city tax.The hotel was fully booked, but at no time was I disturbed or did the hotel feel noisy and cramped.Overall, I would recommend this hotel. If you want 5 star luxury stay somewhere else, but if you want a good value, friendly hotel in a great location, stay here.

<Content>Dirty, Smelly and very Noisy If you want some sleep don't stay at this hotel. My family and I were extremely disappointed by the Europa 92. The general appearance of the hotel was smelly, damp and dusty. My husband and 2 kids booked a family room and were given a room at the front of the hotel. The room was basic and had a very unpleasant smell. It was warm and didn't have air conditioning so we had to open the windows. The noise from the traffic and the trams from the street below was deafening. My husband asked politely at reception about the possibility of changing to a room at the back of the hotel and was met with a barrage of abuse from the girl at reception. He was informed that he shouldn't have booked a city centre hotel if he couldn't put up with the noise. None of the family had any sleep. We were charged 200 euros for one night (without breakfast) which is a complete rip off. The next day I enquired at a very nice 4 star hotel in a more residential part of the city centre about rates and was quoted 165 euros for a family of four.!!! We will know better next time !!.

<Content>Will do in a pinch, look for better prices if you have time We stayed here in a triple bedroom (1 queen and 1 twin) for one week in June. The hotel is generally well kept with a good location. You can walk to shopping, museums and very good restaurants from here. There is a market, an ATM and internet access nearby.The room was generally neat, but as it was an older building, you never really got the sense that it was immaculate. It has many guests in it, but we rarely saw them and had the place virtually to ourselves. There was little or no noise from other guests, but we were situated at the front of the building (which we don't recommend) and heard trams and traffic all night long.The room was standard-small, the bathroom has some unknown mold growth around the vent, and our toilet seemed to be on the verge of falling off of its base. Shower only in our room. We asked for additional pillows every night and were told there were none each time. Others who asked for irons and ironing boards seemed to have difficulty bridging the language or cultural gap and asked repeatedly. Television is limited, but you can purchase several tv channels (including some not children-friendly channels) at the front desk for 7 Euros.The onsite manager is kind and efficient, other staff members were less able to address patron needs. While the website advertises a restaurant and bar, it really is not any place you would stop for more than a half hour - leaving you lots of time to discover good food through out the city!There is an elevator for those with mobility concerns.The location and a functional hotel room that is safe and secure is what you get for your dollar here; if you have time to look around I would recommend looking for something a little more luxurious for your travel dollar (see the Hotel Zandbergen or get a deal on another property). We have no real complaints but felt like we would not stay there again given the choice.

<Content>Very nice place, convenient, good staff (kind and professional) We choose this hotel considering other reviews on the internet. All was perfect. The staff knows the job. The location is really near the museums and the Leidseplein (plenty of restaurants, bars, ...). The bedrooms on the street are a little noisy (trams passing in front of the hotel) but this was not terrible and we slept very well. The bedroom was clean as well as the bathroom. The breakfast is a continental one with different types of bread, cheese, cereals, marmelade, .... Everyone would find what he needs.Very nice place. We would stay there again.

<Content>Excellent location, convenient, good staff and clean I took the advice from a Trip Advisor review and called a week before arriving and requested a garden view room (as the street can get noisy with tram and car noise primarily). I was very happy with my garden view room and would recommend Hotel Europa '92. The room cost $90 U.S. dollars a night and for Amsterdam, it's a steal. You can come and go day and night effortlessly with a great overnight front desk person. You can get around on the trams from right outside of the hotel once you figure the tram system out. It's near a Wagamama if you are a vegetarian (like I am) and after flying for 18 hours Wagamama's fresh vegetables helped with the jetlag). Hotel Europa '92 is in walking distance to the Van Gogh museum and the Rijksmuseum. It's near the flower district, Anne Frank House, and pubs galore.

<Content>Don't leave any valuables in your room We stayed at the hotel for two nights. However, this short time was enough for someone who had access to our room to take just $40 out of the sum of $85 left in one of our suitcases. Otherwise the service was good and the room was well equipped.

<Content>Much better than expected Have just returned from a two night break at the Europa, and I have to say it was lovely. The hotel staff were very friendly, and informative of the sights to see in Amsterdam. The room we had was spotlessly clean, the only drawback being the noise from the street below, if you are a light sleeper, beware, ask for a room at the back of the hotel. The breakfast were more than adequate, with plenty of choice.Good location, and trams leave from just outside, hence the noise. Wonderful Indonesian restaurant just round the corner.

<Content>Frustated! This is my 2nd stay at the hotel and I'm not so sure I would stay there again. The first time went much better. This time there were a few problems, I had asked for a wake-up call the day of my flight home and got NONE and barely made my flight. While there I paid my bill in cash and when I got home I discovered they had charged my credit card $476.46, funny, my bill I paid was $365.00.....I'm glad I kept my receipt! Also, I didn't like it when the maid came in while I was taking a nap, they should have a little sign that you can hang outside the door that lets them know you don't want to be disturbed. The rooms are very small and you can hear your neighbors talking through the walls. The room I got this time was facing the street and when I opened the window (it was stuffy in there) the noise was loud to the point of not being able to hear the TV.The good points are that they have a good breakfast and their location is great!!!!!

<Content>Good hotel! The hotel itself is clean and the staff is polite.However, when you book that hotel make sure you take into account the following:The price posted on the net EXCLUDES 5% city tax4% for credit card use2.25鈧?day for the key to the safe9鈧?day/person for breakfast.(Breakfast includes 3 different cereals, o-juice, fruits, cheese, rolls, sliced bread, different marmelades, etc.)So, in the end you might pay 100鈧?more than you thought you would. One more thing: Ask for a room facing the garden NOT the road. The road is way too busy.Nevertheless, I definitely would recommend this hotel.

<Content>would recommend We have just returned from staying at the Eurpoa 92 for 2 nights. We had room 23 which overlooked the courtyard so there was no traffic noise, it was very quiet for us except the odd selfish people that were noisy coming back to thier rooms The room had a double bed and a single in it. It only had a shower not a bath but that was adequate.Like previous comments the toilet could have done with some bleach. Breakfast was continental but I missed the luxury of toast. The staff were friendly and helpful when prompted. Locality was good, previously we had stayed at the Rho on Dam Square,on comparisson the positio of the Europa was better and for someone who gets lost chasing her own shadow I had no problem with the trams etc. and finding my way around. I would recommedn this hotel.We booked on Deckchair , for two nights and return flights we paid 拢400 all in so we felt it was a good deal.

<Content>No Tea  Just came back from a short break at Hotel Europa 92. The hotel is clean  tidy near a variety of restaurants so many too choose from.Our room no 27 was small with a big bathroom!! but luckily was overlooking the court yard so we were able to get a good nights sleep unlike the other people who were overlooking the busy main road. The staff were a bit reserved  the only draw back was there were no tea or coffee facilities in the rooms.If you want a short reasonably priced break with somewhere just to lay your head then this is the one.March 2004.

<Content>Three star Central location, close walk (10 min.) to main dining/shopping area. Tram available in front of hotel. Friendly front desk staff which is open 24hrs. Room 45 is a big room with 2 large windows, a sink, range, and fridge. Friends stayed in room 47 right next door and it was quite small with no sink, fridge or range. So if you don't like the room you were given, ask to see a different one. Room was clean and the tv offered several English speaking channels (not just CNN). Breakfast is what you expect in a european hotel, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, meats, bread, etc. The stairs leading up to the first floor are a little steep. Our room faced the front of the hotel and like a previous reviewer stated, the street noise can be quite loud. The walls are also quite thin. We paid 90 euros and I feel it was just worth the money.

<Content>Felt like I was sleeping in Amsterdam Centraal Station The hotel is nice, the family are reserved but nice and the courtyard is great.HOWEVER - I suggest you ask for a room at the rear. Our room overlooked the street and the noise from the trams, revellers etc was deafening. This eventually wears you down. The lavatory could also do with an extractor fan and some bleach.

<Content>Watch Out For The Safe Our European holiday started on Tues 10th June from Auckland, New Zealand. One of our stays was at Europa 92, Amsterdam for 2 nights 21st and 22nd June 2003 and have just arrived home from London. On our entire trip we kept all money on our persons. At Europa we used the safe to store our UK pounds. On arriving in London, I was UKP 60 short and my husband UKP 130 short. Whoever had access to our rooms and safe was clever enough to realise that by taking all the money, the alarm would be raised, but by just taking a portion would be unoticed! This matter will be taken up with the hotel but a positive result is not expected. Our travel insurers may also take a suspicious view but there you are.....people be alert! We are extremely careful people so this is a very large disappointment. Sue Smith and Barry Stevens
