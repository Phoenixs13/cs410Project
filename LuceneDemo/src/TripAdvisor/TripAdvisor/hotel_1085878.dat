<Content>Wonderful hotel in the old Tokyo A little hotel in Asakusa, the old part of Tokyo. The hotel has a great location close to shrines and resturants and everything that is happening in the Taito City Area. The rooms are small but had everything that you need. Negative for me was the fact that the window was not able to open.
