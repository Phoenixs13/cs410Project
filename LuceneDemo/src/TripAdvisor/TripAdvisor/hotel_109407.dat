<Content>DONT STAY The hotel cancelled out our reservation even thought we has secured it with a credit card. We arrived at the hotel at 4 pm on satrurday and we planned to stay the whole week there. I arrived to check in and my reservation had been cancelled and they had given the room away we requested. We got another room that was smelly with smoke and we requested a non smoking room . then they charged us $50.00 to stay in the jacuzzi room and i felt like they should have given it to us because of their mistake. The next day we checked into another room and that room had an order of urine and it had not been cleaned. The staff was very friendly. They were in the middleof renovations it was nothing like it was on the internet (no breakfast, no workout room). The hotel was just a mess. I would not recommend anyone to stay there. They were unorganized and the looks were deceiving.

<Content>Scary! Friday the 13th! The motel experience at this Super 8 fits the date. I would guess this was another brand motel, with recent renovations and a new manager (Mid-Eastern). Location was just off an expressway, in an industrial area; warehouses and apartment complexes. First impression was okay until closer examination showed concertina (barbed) wire on the fences of the property and a side entrance closed off. Outside room entrances, 2 floors, no elevator. Several construction vehicles in parking lot, meaning the property is used by transient workers. Rooms were very nice, clean, and conditioned air. AARP rate, 2 adults, $62.09 total. Small, outdoor pool, looked okay but in front of property-lots of road debris. Manager had a mesh fence around the pool to try and keep the debris from the road entering pool. This worked partially, there were still some papers, cigarette butts, leaves, etc. in pool. Big sign on road (as well as motel brochure) advertised wifi, exercise room, and whirlpool- all non-existant. A car alarm went off outside our room at 2:30 AM-thankfully not ours. A man (intoxicated?) was sitting in a p/u truck, fiddling w/alarm(stopped it). But then he started trying the doors of the car next to the truck. I called front desk to inform them but got no answer after a dozen rings. Informed desk next AM, no concerns expressed (an Asian thing?). I always ask for connecting rooms on our vacations. Queried about this again. Same response at this inn- the only rooms that connect already had one occupied. This after a 4 month reservation lead time and a personal phone call 2 days before the arrival- why can't inns grant this request? Continental breakfast in AM, not bad, but crowded area. I would not recommend this property.

This motel probably have 40 to 50 rooms but the are great, nicely renovated and very friendly staff. Seems like new management.very hard to find at economy level motels now a days. great lobby and a great breakffast. I would to love to stay at this motel again and again.

<Content>Never Again  Rooms were not clean. Toiletries were not provided. We were on a trip with 2 other couples. Two couples stayed in one room, and the other couple stayed in another room. We were accused of having 12+ people staying in one room. ??? How is that possible when we only had 3 motorcycles. ??? Our room only had 1 towell. When we asked for more the next morning, we were accused of having extra people in room. Very rude service. We will never stay at this motel again.
