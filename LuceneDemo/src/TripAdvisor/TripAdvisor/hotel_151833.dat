<Content>cool peolpe. Decent place well my stay in this hotel can be pretty much described as dull except for the friendliness of the hotel staff. Especially the really cute front desk guy. Beautiful smile. ;) the rooms were a bit smaller than expected but I guess overall it was a pretty good vacation. Awesome bar too! I know the bartenders made me some pretty good drinks there hehe.

<Content>Dirty and dangerous fun Unfortunately I have to give this fun gay hotel a bad review due to two major problems. The first problem was the gay-bashers/robbers hanging out right outside less than 50 feet from the front door. The second problem was the dirtiest floor that I have ever seen. The manager gets kudos for making an attempt to keep an eye on the suspected gay bashers/robbers. I did not complain to the management about the floor because I am not Puerto Rican and thought that dirty floors might be part of the culture. After all, American floors are usually dirty compared to Asian floors, for instance.The good news is that the Atlantic Beach Hotel has a fun nightlife, with a built-in bar. So, if you like bars, this can be a fun visit. My favorite part was the beachfront continental breakfast that was included -- only to be topped by the very attractive Puerto Rican native young man that I met for a brief, but very memorable romance.I can only recommend this hotel to the most foolhardy of nightlife-lovers. The average traveler might prefer a cleaner, safer hotel.

<Content>Worst Stay Ever at the Atlantic Beach Hotel It was my first stay in the Condado area and it being a short weekend trip I wanted to be on the beach. Therefore, I left a much nicer, yet less expensive hotel a block away to be at the Atlantic Beach Hotel. Within minutes of checking in, my wallet, credit cards and all indentification cards were stolen from me in the middle of the day near the bar area of the hotel. It is not that I hold the hotel responsible for this (however, one would like to think that he/she was safe at the hotel), I got absolutely no assistance from them and had to seek out the police to file a report on my own (not that they were anymore concerned than the Atlantic Beach management and staff). Luckily the hotel had secured a credit card hold for my room. And although they had secured a much higher limit than the rooom rate, they absolutely refused to add a incidental (taxi fare) to the room charge to get me back to the airport. Basically I was stranded and it was the hotel's attitude and lack of concern that bothered me, especially since the theft took place on their property. The next morning when I did check out and tried again to get the hotel to add the incidental (taxi fare) to the ticket before it was closed out, the lady would not, nor would she call the manager to get apporval to do it. When she gave me their copy of my room charges for me to sign, I wrote on it that my credit cards, money and ID's had been stolen while staying there. The lady got furious at this and started yelling. After being told that the room had been billed successfully to my credit card, I had had enough of the Atlantic Beach Hotel and staff. I left without being given a copy of my room charges. It was my decision to leave a better hotel a block away to stay at the Atlantic Beach Hotel. And if it had not been for the theft, I would have accepted everything, even the extremely small, poor condition, over-priced rooms and would have had a good time! It's just the NO-CARE attitude from the management toward their guests is bothersome. One other issue I had was trying to get back up to my room as guests have to be buzzed back in. However, the desk staff were never at the desk and were out on the street talking to other people. Once inside, I felt like I was in a high school dorm on lockdown as guest are not allowed upstairs. You can not despute that the hotel is in a great location and that the bar area is fun and that the barbacks are the BEST. Nevertheless, I would recommend to anyone that they stay at another of the many hotels in the area and experience the Atlantic Beach Bar without staying at the hotel !!! Lessons learned ...and I learned the hard way!

<Content>Dirty and Gross If you are thinking about staying at Atlantic Beach, please reconsider. I stayed a week at this dirty hotel and could not wait to check out. The hotel refused to give us back our money if we checked out because we made reservations. The hotel is outdated, dirty, and just plain gross. The elevator is dirty, look at the light when you step inside plus it is slower than my 90 year old grandma. The beds are uncomfortable, the room was dirty, the floor was gritty with sand, and we found a used condom on the floor. We didnt even have a tv remote, microwave, iron, coffee pot, or a refrigerator. Plus the hotel was being renovated upstairs. We were NOT told of the renovation as we heard hammers and drills all morning. I also caught the desk clerk asleep at 3am when I went out for a snack. Another night I asked for towels 2 different times and the front clerk forgot. He never did bring the towels. Dont stay there. Trust me one step into this dirty hotel and you will know exactly what Im talking about.

<Content>Disgusting Room...Great Location The room at this hotel was absolutely disgusting. Stained sheets, dirty carpet, rusted ceiling fixtures, the bottom of the bathroom door was missing and there were hairs in the drawers. We were told that the room might not have been cleaned because the rooms aren't always used (I wonder why). They would not change our room. Only good thing about this hotel was the location. It was great. However, I would absolutely never never ever stay at this hotel again. The first night, I woke up 4 times afraid that something would crawl on me.

<Content>She was nasty even a decade ago, or so I now hear. DO NOT STAY AT THE ATLANTIC BEACH!The rooms were filthy. They apparently have zero interest maintaining the property, as seems to be the case on much of the Condado. The rooms were small (approximately 10' by 10'). Bar prices were outrageous. My significant other nearly castrated me when he set foot in the room.I wouldn't call it a roach motel. We didn't see a single roach. Roaches have to much pride.I stayed there because it's where family stays, for 2 nights pre-cruise.Never again.AVOID THE ATLANTIC BEACH!

<Content>looks seedy and uninviting One thing I have to mention is that the wonderful Regis (bartender) is unfortunately gone. Other guys are good, but this business will definitely suffer without Regis. He was the only reason we came over to hang out at the bar even though the bar itself didn't look all that great. (we stayed at the Caribe Hilton). The beach is very nice in front of the Atlantic Beach hotel.

<Content>Loved the Atlantic If you are looking for the Ritz Carlton then book it, and do not book here. If you are looking for a clean, fun place to stay and relax then book here at the Atlantic Beach Hotel. I read reviews on this sight and was quite hesitant to stay here but I am glad that I did. The staff was fun, friendly, and quite helpful. The management was willing to please the guests and make the stay as comfortable as possible. The accommodations are not four star but the service is. Everyone working there helped to make my stay exciting and fun.  The bar had a great mix of tourists and locals, it was low key and they prepared fabulous cocktails from 11 a.m. until late in the night. I happened to be there for New Year鈥檚 Eve and we partied and had a great time. The staff went out of their way again to make the evening exciting. I will be returning next year and I hope that more people overlook the negative reviews and give this place a chance.

<Content>Great Location, Great Staff! We recently stayed here before and after a cruise. While the facilities may not be 5 star, the location and friendly staff more than make up for that!The hotel is located right on the beach with free beach chairs available to hotel guests and beach towels provided after leaving a refundable deposit at the front desk. The bar also overlooks the beach and is great for people watching or sitting back with a drink and enjoying the waves.The staff went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and were very friendly. From Chris at the front desk, Dedrick at the bar, Carlos serving drinks on the beach and providing lawn chairs, to Gabriel working the bar......everyone was outstanding!If you are looking for a 5 star hotel with impeccably decorated rooms, this is not the place for you. But if you want an affordable, clean room right on the beach with a bar on premises and an outstanding staff, you would very much enjoy the Atlantic Beach Hotel! I know we will be back!!!!

<Content>Remember, It's not a 5 star hotel It's located between 2 abandoned hotels. A lot of guys hang outside the hotel starting around 10 pm. The elevator does not work, if you want to use it for your luggage. My friend and I stayed in a non ocean front room. It was very tiny, the AC is always blasting, the bedsheets as well as bath towels had stains on them. The bathroom was dusty and very small, no windows to let the heat out. There are no microwaves or refrigerators anywhere, so if you're going to eat out, which most likely you will, eat all of it at the restauarant. A lot of our food went to waste. The staff were very nice, they have people at the front desk 24 hours. Watch out for the $3.50 cans of soda at the bar. Not the best place to stay, We definetely would not stay there again. You have Walgreens, restaurants, souvenir shops, and starbucks in the neighborhood.

<Content>worst place in Puerto Rico San Juan, Puerto Rico Atlantic Beach HotelDate: March 10, 2005Seemed nice when we arrived, we were told to drop the key off at the desk when we went out and pick it up when we came back, so we did. Upon returning after an afternoon of shopping, I went to pick up my key and the desk clerk claimed that I did not leave it off. I explained that I was only gone for an hour and I did leave the key with him. He got very rude with me and flatly refused to issue me a key without paying a $50 fee to replace the key. I had to pay the fee to get a key to my room. He handed me what looked like the key that I dropped off. { who really knows}. He was very rude and raised his voice to me when he refused to give me the key. I feel that I was scammed out of $50 and refuse to stay at this hotel with what appears to be a very unprofessional staff with bad public relations.

<Content>Don't Do it!!!! Don't Do it! if you coming to puerto rico to enjoy the beautiful Island do it elsewhere.. This hotel is located between two abandoned hotels. The rooms are dirty , hallways are dirty. entering and exiting hotel is like a prison..or a pawn shop... you have to be buzzed in... you are not allowed to bring anyone to your room, no friends, visitors no one unless you pay $15 extra per person. First time i stayed there electricity did not work for half the day.. second time i stayed , water did not work for a full day.. we finally checked out of our hotel and are now disputing charges with credit card companies. Stay further down the street at hotels like holiday inn express much cleaner with a pool.. its walking distance so you can still enjoy atlantic beach bar or the gay beach.. but honestly this hotel is miserable.

<Content>A piece of dingy paradise The rooms are a little dingy, bringing your own pillow case is advised, but overall its cheap and you can't beat the location. The bar on the beach is to die for, and the beach it's self is really nice. The staff was really freindly and you cant beat the free continental breakfast on the patio over looking the beach. This place would be perfect if they would just clean their rooms more and get new sheets. If you just want a chill vacation on a beautiful beach this is the place to stay. Overall I would go back again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Beware - Out Traveler review My partner and I switched our hotel reservation to the Atlantic Beach after I read about it in OUT Traveler. What a mistake. The place was so dirty we refused to stay there - and this after looking at two different rooms. The first one had a ratty looking bedspread and a lumpy mattress. I pulled back the sheets and not only found pubic hair but semen stains. We couldn't believe it, hands down the grossest hotel I've ever set foot in. The bathroom was dirty as well and the lobby had peeling paint. The bar stools were rusted. And this was all after OUT Traveler said the bar had been renovated. We refused to stay and then they refused to refund my money until I threw a huge fit and refused to back down. This place is a dump. Ignore OUT Traveler's continual pushing of this joint - for what reason I don't know.

<Content>Take care at the hotel's bar Location is great, and it is a beachfront hotel. BUT, take care at the bar. It has a NYC drinks' prices ( TOOOOOOO expensive), and you most to be a great observer when you are paying a drink. I pay a beer with a $20 bill and i recieved change and i recieved return just $5.00. The bartender didnt gave me the correct change, and i was sure that i payed with a $20 bill because i had only $20 bills on my wallet.I'll never return to that hotel.

<Content>Atlantic Beach Hotel may be a bit rundown but overall it's not too bad. I stayed at the Atlantic Beach late last August 2006 for the first time in several years. I was really miffed because the management has decided to restrict who can come and go from the guest rooms -- for no reason I could asertain other than the management has decided to appoint itself as the gay moral majority. I queried the the manager (or owner -- he didn't identify his role at the Atlantic Beach, except he lives in the penthouse), and his response to my query about this policy was we don't want that here. Who is we? I will find other accommodation when I return.

<Content>Dark, dingy rooms with poor AC. Go somewhere else. From the outside, this gay hotel looks clean. The room I had at the rear of the property was very dark, in fact to read I had to go into the bathroom. The decor was extremely outdated and the air conditioning had no controls and was not cool enough. A total makeover is required to make these rooms habitable.

<Content>Go somewhere else.. Not all the way clean, stained sheets, smokey... No parking. We had to change from the 1st room to another because the bathroom was not clean. Bring shower shoes!! The AC was central regulated by the hotel, so even though we don't smoke, we could smell the other people smoking in our floor. Noisy and poor customer service. The only good thing is a great location, in the heart of the tourist zone, and with its own beach. Beach chair and umbrella provided. It was relatively cheap, considering location. If you have a little more money go somewhere else. If you dont care about sleeping in a noisy environment on a bad bed, save some money and stay here. Will NEVER go back.

<Content>Budget Hotel in Excellent Location Atlantic Beach Hotel offers a budget hotel in an excellent location. The hotel is situated in San Juan Condado Beach and caters to gay travellers especially couples as the hotel does not allow anyone other than hotel guests in rooms (which is a good thing). The rooms are basic, but clean with A/C and hot water in working condition. Bathrooms are a bit small. The ocean view and its location right on the beach in Condado area as well as the free parking and WI-FI throughout the hotel makes up for some defficiencies. The hotel also has a rooftop ocean front deck with lounge chairs and is perfect for spending romantic evening with your lover, spouse, or just hanging out with friends. The hotel also has a coin laundry which is handy for washing clothes especially beach towels and swimming items. My spouse and I loved the hotel and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Water is mixed into their liquor...illegal? I've stayed once before and decided to give it a second chance. I won't make the mistake again. The property has gone downhill considerably AND IT WASN'T GREAT BEFORE...just a few snippets from my recent 3 day stay:1. I was told I could park along the gym on the side of the building by reception (everyone else seems to park there too) and 6 hours later had a $75 ticket on my car. They apparently like to target tourists' cars, I had a Hertz with neverlost in it so it was obvious and the cars in front/behind me has no tickets. 2. The room was filthy. The air conditioner was rusted so bad that I'm shocked it had the ability to freeze me to death- as it did.3. I changed my arrival date within 10 days and they almost refused the change. Poorest cust. service I've seen and I live in Manhattan! I needed to change my vacation dates due to a work trip which came up. NOW FOR THE ICING ON THE CAKE...4. My friend doesn't drink so she ordered a pineablle juice and I had a single beer, 2 drinks = $16 ($8 local beer and $8 juice). I haven't even seen those prices in my 6 years in NYC (yet). 5. THEY ABSOLUTELY MIX WATER WITH THEIR LIQUOR. THERE ARE TINY BUBBLES IN THE VODKA AND TEQUILLA WHICH MAKE IT CLEAR HOW THEY RIP YOU OFF, ALL ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT 5 HARD DRINKS WON'T EVEN GET YOU BUZZED. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME THEN ORDER A SHOT (JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY USE THE SAME BOTTLE AS THE DRINKS THEY POURED YOU EARLIER). F.

<Content>FANTASTIC VACATION We recently stayed at the Atlantic Beach Hotel for 5 nights and very much enjoyed our entire stay at the property. The location is directly on the beach and within walking distance to some great restaurants.The staff at the front desk and bar employees treated us great. The maids were also very nice, although there was a bit of a language barrier at times we were very pleased with the way they cleaned our rooms and they always left us extra towels.We definately plan on returning very soon to Puerto Rico and the Atlantic Beach Hotel.

<Content>Great location and right on the beach I had the pleasure of staying at the Atlantic Beach Hotel in June 2006.This hotel is right on beach. I found the staff to be extremely friendly. The hotel offers a dining area which overlooks the beach so every morning I enjoyed having my continental breakfast while looking at the fabulous ocean!The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. The weather was quite humid so the air conditioning was a comfortable relief.The patio bar is the best in the area for atmosphere, music, and view of the ocean.Bottom line, I had a great time and loved the Atlantic Beach Hotel.

<Content>Hotel did not refund my deposit I had a reservation for a two week say at the hotel. I heard of a government crisis and did not feel comfortable going to Puerto Rico at that time. I called the hotel about 10 days before to cancel my reservation. The hotel refused to refund me my two day deposit. They were not courteous to me or cooperative. I have been going to the hotel for years and would have gladly put my deposit towards a future day. The refused and were very nasty. Now I now why this hotel has so many negative reviews.

<Content>Had A Great Stay At This Hotel I wont say this was an excellent hotel but I enjoy my stay for six days with my partner. Everything was convinent for us, we both loved the beach and the good service they provided. Just one bit problem and that was it was no refergerator in the room we were in which i believe was the Standard room but not much I can complain for good price.

<Content>Another Positive Stay at The Atlantic We recently returned on 3/23/2006 from our fifth annual stay at the Atlantic Beach Hotel. Based on our past visits we have never understood some of the negative commente made about this hotel. We have always found more good points about this hotel than negative.This year we were able to book our reservation directly thru their web site on their new reservations system which we found to be very quick and convenient. All of the rooms we have stayed in over the past 5 years have been absolutely fine with ample space and always very clean bathrooms with plenty of towels.All of the staff is really very friendly and helpful and the service could not be faulted. The location is ideal and so close to everywhere that we have always wanted to go while in Puerto Rico. We look forward to our sixth visit next year, and we will continue to recommend the Atlantic Beach based on our past five stays.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel/Location I just returned from Puerto Rico and a 15 night stay at the Atlantic Beach Hotel. I have to admit to being worried about booking such a long stay at this hotel after a few of the negative reviews. But from the moment I arrived I knew it would be a great place to stay.All of the employees and management made me feel right at home from the day I arrived to the day I departed. They were all so friendly and helpful, and couldn't do enough for me. The hotel's location is perfect with a good selection of restaurants close by.The Atlantic Beach Bar was really HOT, and was always a great place for drinks and meeting locals. All in all, I had a very positive experience at the Atlantic Beach Hotel and have already booked my return trip for July 2006.

<Content>Not a complaint in the world.... I stayed at the Atlantic Beach after staying at the Marriott down the beach and drinking at the Atlantic Beach bar for a couple of past visits. I finally decided to take a chance after the Marriott wanted $250 for a night. I was pleasantly surprise with the room and the value of the property. Don't get me wrong...it is basic accommodations by luxury standards and if you want the Ritz Carlton (at the $400 p/n price tag) it is down the road a few blocks. I stayed on the 4th Floor in an ocean view room on the end. I usually stay in top suites at top hotels but for a few days at the beach and out of the cold of the northeast, how bad could it be. It wasn't bad at all. The room was clean and comfortable. I saw nothing that other claim. The water was hot in the shower (or though you did need to run it to get the water up to the top floor in the morning) and it was convenient to both Old San Juan and the trendier clubs. The bus stops a block away to you can get to Old San Juan or the Plazas des Americas very easy and cheap.PROS: PRICE, friendly staff, convenient bar and beach, great breakfast on siteCONS: None really unless you're expecting the Ritz Carlton and in that case, have fun with the old people cause we'll be drinking on the beach.I had a wonderful visit, drank my butt off at the bar, met some great people with whom I still stay in contact from my area and will be repeating the entire thing next November (if not sooner).

<Content>i had a good time I stayed solo at Atlantic beach for 8 days at the end of March, and had a great time. It may help to have a somewhat limited expectations. It's not the Marriott, which for me is a plus. It is a great location, on the beach, in the center of the Condado, lots of places to eat, shop, or hang out.There are hot bars and dance clubs in Santerce, just up the hill,and the spectacular Old City a short cab ride away.I had a room facing the ocean, (very clean) and really enjoyed that. The rooms are modest but comfortable. It's true that the airconditioning is cold and the only solution is to tape over the ducts but, so what.I didn't care, as i was at the beach all day,at the bar in the hotel for happy hour each night,and otherwise with my friends out doing things. Staff was really friendly and helpful, from the beach boys to the front desk, to the cool Jamaican woman who cooks breakfast.Probably helped that the weather was perfect, clearand 85 degrees and beach full of hot guys, butthat's really what i came for. There's a great terrace on the 5th floor,with a beautiful view, very private, very peaceful. check it out.

<Content>Excellent All I can say is the Atlantic Beach Hotel was an excellent choice for us. My partner and I just returned from a week long vacation in Puerto Rico (3/10/06 to 3/17/06). And we can honestly admit that you truly can't do better than the Atlantic. Our room was a bit small but it was more than adequate, and the housekeeping staff was great and they always made sure that our room remained spotless. The hotel's beach front location was perfect for us as well. All of the hotel and bar staff were great and they were always ready to help us with any of the requests we had. We will definitely recomend this hotel to all of our friends and we will most certainly return again very soon.

<Content>Great place! Good location! Very Clean! Listen... I had read all the reviews on the internet prior to booking a room at the Atlantic Beach Hotel and was more than concerned about some of the negative reports. Let me set the record straight! In my opinion the people who complained about this hotel should just stayed home! Or better yet go ahead and spend the $500 plus and stay in a 5 star hotel. This hotel is by far, more than we expected. Everyone knows that you can't please everyone and some you can't please at all. This is a great small hotel with nice rooms, perfect location and great service.

<Content>Not a Bad Place I would like to say its not as bad as the reviews make it to be. I hear people talking about bugs and the place not being clean. What lies! I saw cleaning peoples every day changing the sheets and cleaning the rooms. The staff was very helpful and kind. Yes its not a five star hotel so do don't expect it. I went with my partner and 2 other guys. We all would agree that it served its purpose for the 2 weeks that we were there. There could be improvements but you get what you pay for!

<Content>Lousy hotel, friendly staff We didn't know that it was a predominantly gay hotel, but learned from the info desk at the airport. Taxi driver said we were the second straight couple he had taken there in 14 years. When we were there, though, it was mostly gay couples, plus some straight couples and families-- very subdued, in spite of the photos of cross-dressers in the lobby. The room was dumpy, uncomfortable mattress, fungus on ceiling. No control over the AC-- the room was FREEZING! Their only solution was to put tape over the vent. Argh. Still, the staff at the desk was always available with advice and a smile-- more approachable and friendly than anywhere else we experienced in San Juan. The hotel was right on the beach, and the beach was WONDERFUL. It was great to be right on the water.

<Content>For the price - No complaints My stay at the Atlantic Beach Hotel was exactly what I expected for the price. The rooms are small but when in San Juan, how much time are you going to spend in there. The room was cleaned daily and the beds were made, as well as all the linens replaced. The beach is one of the nicest around which explains all the people not staying at the hotel there.If you are an extremely high maintenance person, don't stay here. If you want something comfortable, clean, and affordable this is the place to stay.

<Content>Definitely not the Ritz. You get what you pay for. The rooms are small but ours was clean (we were ocean front). The floors were ceramic in our room. The Condado area is convenient to area attractions. The bar prices could be lower $5.00 a drink (small plastic cups). The elevator ride is priceless. We used our room just as a place to sleep after a day of touring. We found that if you close the hurricane shutters the bar noise was blocked out. We would stay here again if we returned to San Juan. The owner could get rid of the double and twin bed in the room and replace them with queen beds. It would make the sleeping arrangements more comfortable.

<Content>Worst place I've ever stayed! Bugs, noises, dirty linens, toilets with leftovers on them. I could go on and on about this place but the fact is that if you want to enjoy your trip in beautiful Puerto Rico, start by avoiding the Atlantic Beach Hotel. There are dozens of hotels you could stay at along the wonderful San Juan and Old San Juan strip.

<Content>Terrible experience! Quite possibly the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. The outside of the building is nice, but once you open the door to the lobby, the problems start. There's a strange smell when you entire the stairs to your room. Once in the room you see the carpet is stained by a half dozen strange colors, the smell is awful. I had ants crawling on my left leg when I was trying to sleep. The beds are rough and not comfortable to sleep on, let alone with two people if you're a couple! The bar is nasty. We left after one night and found a gorgeous room at the Sheraton in Old San Juan for only $45 more/night. If you're visiting San Juan, PLEASE don't feel like you're missing out on anything by not staying at the Atlantic Beach Hotel or even going to its bar. Completely unremarkable and forgettable, except for the ants, the smells, the ridiculous price and horrible sleeping conditions.Stay in Old San Juan. Plenty of family there in guest houses or boutique hotels, which is the way to go. Or just stay in the darn Sheraton. I know it's big and stuff, but you'll sure as heck sleep better than you would at the Atlantic Beach Hotel.

<Content>Do not stay here! Absolutely breath taking view and wonderful beach. Absolutely terrible hotel.From having to clean my own room when I arrrived (could not see the beautiful ocean view ocean through the dirty windows, cleaning someone elses feces off the toilet, spraying for the swarm of mosqitoes in the room, sweeping and mopping the dirty floor. I am a slob, but this place was tooo much.) to the non-existent and nasty service this is a disaster.The hotel is poorly maintained(the elevator has broken three times, once with me in it.) poorly cleaned and decaying former status as a gay icon. The bar is never full and serves, what appear to be watered down drinks. I wanted to have happy glow one night. I am not a drinker, two beers makes me sleepy, (a cheap date). I drank 8 double Jacks on the rocks and I was slighly buzzed. I should have been under the table after 2 drinks.I stay in Puerto Rico twice a year to see family and have stayed in top end settings and exquisite small guest houses. I am not usually fussy and have enjoyed each in their own way.For Atlantic Beach Hotel, the view is worth the money, but do not expect anything else from this hotel. STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!

<Content>It's simple; This is a dump When we first arrived to the Atlantic Beach Hotel, I asked the receptionist where would be a good place to eat dinner. Her response: Wendy's or Subway. I knew I was in trouble. It's quite simple; this place is a dump! I booked the hotel after doing research on this web sight and noticed very mixed reviews; some being good. There is nothing good to say about this hotel. The room was small, with a poor ventilation system. You can smell cigarette smoke in your room when a neighbor is smoking! Upon our departure, the elevator was broken and we were required to carry all of our luggage down 4 flights of stairs. If you want to experience the gay scene, stay at the Marriott and walk over to the Atlantic Beach Hotel for a drink. In fact, I would not recommend staying in the Condado area of San Juan. It is not a nice area and there are many abandoned buildings right on the ocean front. I would recommend staying in Old San Juan, which is very much like a sparkling New Orleans. Live and learn, as they say!

<Content>Reasonable and extremely friendly hotel I have never met a more attentive staff than the Atlantic Hotel. The accomodations are older but they keep it clean. Having the beach bar was a great ammenity. I would highly recommend this place for a visit to Puerto Rico...it'll be our first stop again. The bus stop is a short distance for service to Old San Juan (B21).

<Content>Good Value for what you pay I was also worried prior to checking in at this hotel, based on the conflicting reviews. First things first, this hotel costs about $120 per night, and is right on the beach. That qualifies for a budget hotel. If you want luxury, the Marriot is right down the street for $200/night.The Atlantic Beach staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The bar is lively, and the bartenders are very friendly too. When my partner and I asked about other clubs to visit, the hotel staff brought us the local gay magazine and made several helpful suggestions.The lobby is functional and clean with no frills. The elevator is in serious need of a facelift, and does give a bad first impression. The hallways are clean and well kept. Our room was clean, and the bathroom was actually recently renovated. The shower was very narrow, and you almost had to stand sideways, but as I said it was all new, including new windows in the bathroom. There is free coffee, juice  bagels etc in the breakfast area, which is VERY clean and overlooks the ocean. For the price you pay for the room, I wouldn't expect a full breakfast to be included. Lounge Chairs on the beach are provided, and towels are free with a $10 deposit (same as most places).Overall, we had a really good time here and would stay here again.

<Content>A squalid, flea bag of a hotel. Squalid! A vile, nasty place that made me feel worse than I did before leaving post-Katrina New Orleans. I made reservations for my partner and myself based on the website, thinking the negative reviews were balanced by the positives, and hated it. We did not even stay in the building 5 minutes before leaving to find another hotel in the area. We returned to check out and were told that the hotel would charge our credit card even though we were not staying for the weekend. Do not stay there.

<Content>Hated It Stupidly, I discounted the negative reviews of this hotel and checked in for three nights after more than a week in Santo Domingo. My initial reaction was what have I done??!!!! The lobby area gave the impression of an abandoned loading area....nothing there gave me the feeling that this was a well-maintained place. Everything was either dirty, rusty, untidy or just plain grungy. The so-called roof garden with jacuzzi was a total mess...nothing working and dirt everywhere. My room was reasonably clean but there were few facilities, just bed and TV, and it's impossible to control the air conditioning. Although there was a view of the beach, the windows are small. Don't be fooled by the free breakfast thing...it's only coffee and toast. If you order anything from the menu you have to pay full price. The one morning that I did this, the waitress rudely told me that I have to pay immediately at the front desk and loudly called the receptionist telling him to collect the money from me as I left the (untidy) dining area....as if I was about to run away with their money.I booked this hotel precisely because it is advertised as gay-friendly. But, there is very little there for the single gay traveller. There is no information available on gay-related activities and the front desk staff do not make any effort to make you feel at home. They have a happy hour when some of the local gay community come to the bar but that's about it. If this had been a budget-priced place I might not have hated it as much but these people charge top dollar...($125 per night). I was glad when it all ended. May advice.....find somewhere else.

<Content>Buyer Beware!!! I don't even know where to start. This is a dingy, run down, unfriendly building. I am 50 years old, and a seasoned traveler. I arrived late at night and was shown two terrible rooms. I agreed to the third room only to be called one hour later that they were going to bill me twice the promised amount. When I refused (but agreed to leave early the next morning, as it was very late and I had begun to unpack) they threatened me with police action and threw two women out in the street. You think this is gay friendly???Think again.....

<Content>Absolute Dump Hotel is awful; bar and beach is fun. Stay elsewhere and do happy hour here here. Stayed in March 2005. -Location is Condado is good; Calle Vendig is a bit seedy.-Room not well cleaned-took them 2 days to vacuum up sand in my room.-Wallpaper hanging off the wall-No hot water-Sheets seemed clean (although stained)-Loud, especially on the Ocean side; difficult to sleep.-Staff was friendly, but couldn't do much.Overall, the $170 per night is WAY too much for what you get.

<Content>Worth the stay We stayed at the Atlantic Beach hotel for 4 nights and would stay again. We stayed in room 403 which had a great view of the ocean, beach and bar. You can watch the drag shows from the room. The room was big and comfortable. It had a queen bed and a twin bed in front of the window. Our room was clean and had towels and soap (no shampoo). The TV was old but everything else was fine. We paid $170/nt. For more luxury go to the Marriott which is a short walk away and pay the additional $70/night. The staff was friendly and the bar was fun but the location was the best.

<Content>Recent Stay This hotel is located in the Condado on the beach in San Juan. While the hotel is a great location and has a bar on the beach, this hotel has limited services, the front desk staff is unfriendly and is not helpful, the rooms are dirty, the bar is loud and you can not sleep, the hotel is in general a run down hotel on the beach. They charge top dollar for this hotel and for the money, you can find other hotels.I was told there was a hot tub on the roof - when I arrive there was no hot tub. Ocean view is through a small window.The breakfast is a muffin only in a dirty run down restaurant.I rate this hotel terrible in all aspects.Especially the reason you go to San Juan - the beach - is terrible, small and dirty.

<Content>FUN NIGHT We always cruise out of San Juan, this time we stayed 3 night before our cruise..... the first night we got in late from our flight.... we hung around the hotel and had more than a few drinks at the bar. There we met the best bartender!! We had a great time meeting alot of people and laughing it up all night.... the next few days and night we explored the city, we always come back to a clean room, the service is always nice. We never encountered anything seedy or suspicious... besides every hotel has its dark corners. I would definately recommend a few nights here for any of my gay freinds!!!

<Content>Lower you epectations and have a great time! I had the same experience as another reviewer in terms of making reservations. It took them so long to follow-up on my e-mail that by the time they did, all other hotels were books. The Atlantic Beach was my last resort so I lowered my expectations and left the freezing temperatures of Chicago for my vacation in Puerto Rico. With my own towel, soap and tissue in tow, the taxi dropped us at the hotel on a beautifully sunny day. Checkin was pretty flawless, they had a file on me. The reservation system didn't appear to be computerized although there is a computer at the front desk. My file consisted the faxed reservation from that took them a while to send and that I was worried about faxing back to them via unsecured fax line. I was asked to complete a couple of other forms - name and address, traveling companion - the basics but then the clerk asked me to sign a blank charge ticket. I inquired that there should be a dollar amount on the slip before I signed it but the clerk reassured me that it's o.k. Just trust me, the cutie behind the counter smiled to me. I did aother quick attitude adjustment and signed the damn thing. The hotel location was perfect. Couldn't get any better Condado. The building literally sits on the beach. The hotel lobby was nice, nothing special, but immediately to you left was the open bar and restaurant area that exopsed a clear sky and beautiful ocean. I started to think that maybe this won't be so bad afterall! Our room was sort neat-nasty. The furnishings - two beda, night table, dresser, tv, we nearly arranged in the tight perfectly square room but the place was dirty. Nothing that a fresh coat a paint and more detailed cleaning couldn't fix though. The bed linens were clean (they smelled like laundry) but the bedspread smelled musky and mildewed. There were towels, tissue and soap however! We unpacked quickly, not allowing our feet to touch the through run between the two beds, and heading to the bar. Most of our time in Puerto Rico was spent outside of our hotel room making this stay a great experience. When we weren't on the beach drinking and sunning we were at a restaurant, casino or bar. The staff was wonderful. There was a few straight couples (more than I expected) there, kids and all. Check out was pretty straight forward. The blank credit card slip that I signed coming in had been conveniently filled out with the correct amount for my stay. Our check out was earlier than our flight depature so they checked our bags while we went a Casino for our last pull of the slot arm. We we lost our last quarters, we return to our luggage, they called us a taxi and we were off. I'd stay here again in a heart beat! Highly Recommended but adjust your expectations.

<Content>think twice it was nice to be near the beach and have the bar at the hotel. the rest of my stay was terrible! the rooms are small and dirty. when i checked in the room had sand and paint chips on the floor, the bathroom toilet and floor were dirty. in the bar area the bathroom had no paper towels in it, after asking three times over 2 days a employee told me to tell the owner, so i did, it took another day for them to appear. kind of makes u think where the employee's were washing their hands since there was no other place for them. the bathrooms at the front desk were closed for the 7 days i was there. the 3 rd night a fist fight between two bar staff broke out, bad enough that the police were call and one of the employees was arrested. two of the bar stool broke under the weight of two customers while sitting and talking. a friend staying at a better hotel tried to pick me up for diner on new years eve, the staff would not let him past the front door of hotel to call or get me. they wanted $5 cover for floor show in bar, he told them he just wanted to get a guest, they still wanted the 5. we stay for drinks to see the show, no show most people left by 12:45 as we did to go to other area bars which were packed. the last day i went to the beach till i left, when i went back to my room at 11:30am the maid was already done cleaning my room even though the do not disturb sign was out on knob. check out isn't till 12 noon. while looking at the tools she used to clean my room, she had nothing to clean the carpet with and just a mop no water to clean the bathroom floor with. she just used it room to room. when i checked out and told the manager he said to tell the owner, i asked if he would just relay my concerns. he gave me the bill and tried to over charge me for the room $150 a night instead of $130. i had the comfirmation with the rates on it, he said the owner would have to deal with this. 1/2 hour later the owner came and fixed it. i told he about my stay, he started to swear at me and tell me it must be me! a group of us staying at thre hotel became friendly and compared rates for the same size rooms they range from $69.50 to $150 a night. we all called to make rsvp???? what factor do they use we all had no ocean views????????? think twice they want are money and insult us at the same time......not too gay friendly

<Content>Party Central for San Juan Gay Life, (By Day and By Night) I had a fantastic time in San Juan and the Atlantic Beach Hotel is the focal point of everything during my stay. First, the people are great, from the bar staff, (and yes, I spent a lot of time here), to the front desk, security, and house keeping, the people make it so much fun. This was my third visit here over the last five years and Terri has really turned the staff around here, much improved over what it was when he took over the establishment. Terri has taken a very hands on interest in the place and is there every day and night to see that his guests are satisified. He is remodelling roomes and the hotel. It is a big project but progress is being made in every corner. There are other alternatives in the area but this is party central, it is all about convenience. You can walk from the bar to your room when you need something or have that visitor that wants to see what your room looks like. The bar is active seven days a week, party central and the starting point for every evening. And, YES, you can bring visitors up to the rooms. The security and hotel staff do filter out the problematic people but if the guest does not have a history or it is an obvious problem person, they are there to protect you. They welcome you to have a guest up to your room. Don't go by what you have heard in the past, this place is party central and is getting better every day. Thanks to Terri and his entire staff. Jim

<Content>BEWARE! We were sent here due to a canceled AA flight since they said all other hotels in San Juan were booked. When we pulled up, there were seedy looking men hanging around the front of the building. We went to check in and noticed the pictures of men in drag and the gay drinks listed on the menu. Ok, a gay hotel, no problem EXCEPT when it appears to be a gay hotel that rents by the hour! We went up to our room which we were told we had to share a bathroom with the couple we were with. The rooms were absolutely disgusting! You are better off sleeping in the airport or in a car! Dirty, dirty, pee on the toilet, blood on the bathroom wall, stained sheets, shredded carpeting, smoky, phone did not work, etc. $185/night? C'mon. I've traveled extensively and have never seen this type of room in my life! I don't know where the other reviewers were staying but it was not here! We called around and found a room at the Marriot and walked there after checking out in 10 minutes!

<Content>Clean  If you are expecting the Ritz.. find somewhere else to go. My friend (25yo)and I (23yo) spent the New Year at the Atlantic Beach and we had a great time for the week we were there. The front desk staff is semi friendly.. the bar was great times  the bartenders are fun as well.. you just have to make an effort to be personable and get to know the guys (you just can't sit there! Be sociable!).Upon check-in everything was great and we were buzzed in and then we got into the Crickity  somewhat scarry elevator which took us to our room. The room was clean and similar to what you would get at Super 8. The view was fantastic and so was the one from the top sun deck.Okay.. lets do the pros  cons:Pros- Location, Bar, Beach steps away, View, Clean Rooms, AtmosphereCons- Older building, the Elevator, Waiting for Hot Water (run the shower for about 5 min before getting in), lack of storage in rooms.Previous posts on here say some of the worst things.. but honestly people.. this is a great place to stay due to its location and atmosphere. Overall quality is okay... if I were to go back to PR, I would probably stay @ the Atlantic again.(Tips for PR: If you are up for taking the bus.. its only 25cents to Old SanJuan.. Taxi is approx $12 eachway. Also, the shops in OSJ close EARLY !) Most of all have fun  enjoy your trip.. I know we did!

<Content>nice staff, clean room My husband and I ( not gay ) picked The Atlantic Beach Hotel out of a magazine on our way to our one night stay in San Juan. We did not know it was a gay hotel but found out just as we finished checking in. The staff was absolutelly friendly, helpful and very accomodating and we arent even gay!!!!!!!. We had read so many bad reviews about hotels in San Juan and were advised to be shown a room before you pay for it. The staff had no problem showing our room to us before we even payed. Our room was just a room but very clean and smelled just fine. It even had a nice view of the ocean. The outside bar was completely tropical, the cocktails were great. I wish we could have stayed longer, they were just putting up all their Christmas decorations.

<Content>Unreliable and risky First I sent email via their web site. No response. Determined, last week I telephoned this hotel to make my December reservations. I gave information to the person who answered the phone; my dates, name, email address for confirmation. After a week of hearing nothing on a confirmation, I called again. This time spoke to someone else. When I explained I hadn't received my confirmation he said  Oh yes I saw your name around here somewhere but we can't give you a reservation. When I inquired why he simply said Oh we always have rooms. Just come here on the day you arrive I explained I was coming for my first visit to PR from California and was not comfortable flying all that way without a confirmed room. He was rather Oh well. When I inquired as to why no one contacted me, he had no explanation. Now I must scurry to find another place having wasted all this time expecting I already had a room. Thank goodness I didn't arrive in December only to be told I have no room and Oh well.

<Content>I was very pleased with my stay. I have been visiting an Juan, Puerto Rico for the past fifteen years. and have stayed numerous times at the Atlantic Beach hotel over the years.Although it had been two years since my last visit to San juan and the Atlantic Beach, I decided to give the Hotel and its new management a try despite some of the negative reviews that had been posted all over the internet.I was truly surprised, and pleased at the experience I had encountered during my ten-day stay. What I experienced was a completely transformed gay-frinedly hotel with a much different environment from which I had previously experienced on my visits over the past 15 years.The first thing I noticed upon arriving was that all of the hustlers (drug addicts) who used to surround the area 24 hours a day (streets, gay beach, Barefoot Bar, etc...) as well a inside the rooms and bar of the Atlantic Beach had disappeared entirely. The new management has apparently restricted their entrance to the property so they have all vanished or moved on to other areas outside the Condado.During my stay, there were numerous old local friend who I had met on previous visits to Puerto Rico, as well as some new aquaintances that the hotel staff and management said were more than welcome to visit me in my room. However, they made it quite clear that the hutlers were not permitted anywhere on the premises, if that was my intentions. This new policy made me feel something that I had never felt before during my previous stays at the Atlantic Beach - safe and secure.Along with a definitely more friendly management and staff, I noticed a much cleaner, organized and upgraded hotel accomadations which appeared to be an ongoing project.I must say that the new management and staff has created one of the most charming, friendly, fun and safe hotels in all of puerto Rico. I will definitely return very soon.

<Content>"HAPPY ENDING" I recently spent six wonderful nights at the Atlantic Beach Hotel in San Juan. Within one hour of my returning home I received a call from the general manager of the Atlantic Beach Hotel informing me that I had forgotten my jewelry bag with several pieces of my most prized and sentimental pieces of jewelry in the room. I was completely shocked as I had yet to unpack my luggage. The general manager assured me that all would be taken care of and not to worryThe following morning I was awaken at 8:30am to discover that my jewelry bag was being special delivered by a FedEx representative with all its contents intact, courtesy of the Atlantic Beach Hotel management. This to me was such a shock that they would go beyond the call of dutie to make sure I had safely received my valuables.I feel I was so blessed to regain my jewelry, not only for the monetary value, but for its sentimental value. My sincere thanks and gratitude go out to the entire staff and management and especially the honest and wonderful housekeepers. It makes me so proud that we still have such honest, conscience and caring people in this world that we live in.Thank You so much Atlantic Beach Hotel.

<Content>"FANTASTIC GETAWAY, LOVED IT" This was the second time we have stayed at the Atlantic Beach Hotel, and like the first time it was perfect. The whole staff at the front desk, especially George and the bar (Josheau, Stewart) are extremly helpful, professional and friendly.The room and the surrounding property was clean and everything was working properly in our room. Even though the room had central air, we were quite comfortable with the new system. The new windows in our room were also as nice way to get a nice breath of the ocean air.We will certainly be back as soon as we can. Thanks!!

<Content>Best Place to Stay for the Gay Traveler Stayed here on Labor Day and had a great time. If you are expecting four-star luxury, move on. But if you want a simple bed and shower right on the beach with LOTS of gay eye candy, this is your place. The bar below is fun, but the bartenders can be rude. Because so many people visit the bar security to get upstairs is controlled. So if you are looking to bring people back to your room this isn't the place. Very close to Wendy's and Dunkin Donuts, Walgreens, and all the shops. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Stay Away From This Attitude Zone I have been traveling to PR for more than a decade. I have been staying at the Atlantic Beach Hotel for almost as long. Up until recently, my experiences with this hotel have been wonderous. Around 2000-2001 the hotel's general managers have been slowly purchasing the hotel from the long time owner. Let me just say, that these new owners (there are 2 and they are also lovers) have a different sense of hospitality. They also seem to have a specific agenda of the type (race, socio-economic) people they want at their hotel. One even wonders if they will one day abandoned the Gay theme for the str8 set (I am sure if the money is good they will). I have subsequently refused to stay at the hotel on my last few trips to this paradise island and have found some nice bed and breakfast accomodations in the area. Unfortunately, the bar at the hotel is still the only real happenings during the week. Just stay clear of the big white haired bear and you will be okay!

<Content>one of my favorite places to stay in the world... I have stayed at the Atlantic Beach Hotel twice, and I wouldn't stay anywhere else in San Juan. My jaw dropped when I first walked in and saw the cute beach bar with the ocean in the background. The staff are very friendly. The rooms are clean but of standard hotel chain variety, but I do like the rooms with an ocean view much better (you can hear the waves when you fall asleep at night). But hopefully when you visit here you won't be spending too much time in your room! I have had decent breakfasts here, once again while sitting at a table with an ocean view. The beach in front is very gay, and the waves are so much fun to play in - but be careful you don't go out too far, as it's hard to swim back in. I speak from experience on this one! The rooftop deck is awesome. I wish I could attach photos to this review, as I have some great ones of the views and the hotel. Very nice location for shopping, restaurants, bars and clubs. Highly recommended by this world traveler!

<Content>Repeat Guests For the second consecutive year, we stayed at the Atlantic Beach Hotel and enjoyed it more than ever. Our ocean front room was recently remodeled and the view of the beach and ocean each morning was just the thing to start the day right. The hotel staff was very friendly and cooperative (as long as you are). The bartenders are very friendly and accommodating. The beach was very clean and very active with friendly people from all over the world. The convenient location of the hotel is within walking distance of a wide variety of restaurants and stores. However, coffee, orange juice, and a bagel (complimentary breakfast) overlooking the sand and water was just the way to get every morning started before basking in the sun on the beach. Nothing but good things to say about the Atlantic Beach Hotel!

<Content>Do not stay here! Thanks to American Airlines that made me loose my connection to Mayaguez after their flight was delayed for over 6 hours, I had the misfortune of staying here. I knew the dump from years back when I stayed there overningt on my way to St. Thomas so I objected vigorously. They claimed that all other hotels were full!When I got to my dirty room, I noticed that there was a lock to the tiny closet-bad sign. After complaining that there was a loud air conditioning unit in front of my room, I was told that they had no other rooms and that the noise would stop-a lie. The door to the room did not reach the floor leaving about a 2 inch aperture, which meant beein woken up everytime noisy guests arrived speaking loudly and banging doors. To top everything the bed's cover had graffity on the inside! After all of this I was so leary of the environment afraid of contracting God knows what malady.Breakfast the next day was a nightmare-water down coffee and orange juice and greassy omelette. I could not use the phone to talk to my family advising them of my new arrival time because the hotel did not have a deposit from me-this is a new one. All in all a horrible evening!
