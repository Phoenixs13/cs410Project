<Content>Would Stay Again This was a nice hotel to stay at - providing you are not planning on spending a lot of time in the room. The rooms are small - I stayed in a double, and it was a bit cramped. But the rooms were very clean, as was the rest of the hotel. The staff was very accomodating - I needed a different adapter and they sold it at the desk, then also gave me a lesson in how to plug in the converter. They also willingly moved my room when I found that the first room was very noisy (situated right in between the stairs and elevator). It was a pleasant place to rest my head after a long day of walking the streets in beautiful Florence.

<Content>Quiet and friendly This hotel is conveniently located in Florence -close to railway station and about 15 minutes from Car hire offices. It is also close to markets, Duomo and river. We found the room to be very clean, well appointed but very small. There was little space for more than one suitcase. We had to use the door space to store a second bag. Bathroom/shower was excellent, double glazed windows blocked out all external sound. Bed was excellent as was breakfast. Many restaurants within minutes of the hotel. Reception staff friendly and many spoke good English.Overall, an excellent place to stay.

<Content>Great place to stay We have just returned from a long weekend in Florence staying at Hotel Sempione. The hotel was in a great position, within walking distance of all the city landmarks. Great breakfast, very friendly and helpful staff and some brilliant recommendations for restaurants for dinner. I have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to everyone.

<Content>Great place to stay! Stayed for 4 nights at the end of September and have no complaints at all. The hotel was lovely and clean, great location and the staff were always around and always helpful. They helped any time we asked for it. We got the room with the big loo! now I understand how a recent guest said their legs dangled. Had a lovely visit and would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Convenient, Clean, Well Priced We stayed in Room 64. It was wonderful...typical smallish European room but it had a large patio (no view). The room was spotless, as was the bathroom. We needed a place near the train station and close to Hertz. This was perfect. A five minute walk to the station and another 5 to Hertz. Breakfast was very good, hot pastries , great coffee, cheese, ham, and the usual assortment of juice, yougurt, and cereal. The people on the front desk were extremely helpful. We were concerned about the airconditioning -based on other reviews. It worked well...and it was very warm in Florence.

<Content>great location This hotel was a really good location, the carparking was weird as the receptionist called a bloke who came and picked our car up, which i was a bit worried about (baring in mind we had driven from england via france and spain and was only half way round our holiday), but we got it back without a scratch the next day no problems. the hotel was small, but i think they all are around there, as its a town location. nice and clean and 2 mins walk from the main square. perfect!!

<Content>Clean, Great Location, Great Service This hotel is in a very good location, right near the train station, 3 minute walk to the Duomo and 5 minute walk to Ponte Vecchio. Florence is pretty small so everything is walking distance. There is a cute market just half a block away, which sold all different types of leather goods, shawls, etc. Fantastic!The hotel is very clean, the staff is nice, and the breakfast is satisfactory. We were surprised when we arrived to get a nice room with a large terrace!! It was so pleasant, and for 100 euro per night you couldn't beat it.If you are looking for a budget hotel that is clean and central, this is it! Lots of little restaurants nearby, lively since it is close to the station. Friendly staff. Book online with at the hotel's website - it is cheaper (although make sure to read the cancellation policy).

<Content>Fantastic location, fantastic city I stayed here with a friend for 4 nights on a recent trip to Europe and it was a great experience. The hotel is REALLY close to the main Santa Maria Novella station, literally a 2 minute walk, and easy to find. Florence isn't that big, so it was a really convenient base for sightseeing too. Plenty of restaurants, cafes, gelaterias and shops within easy walking distance. The staff were nice, the service was great, the rooms were fine - decent size, clean, comfortable etc., and the breakfast that was included in our room rate was tasty. Overall it was fantastic.

<Content>Wonderful value - useful location This was a good find at a bargain price. Close to the station which proved very useful for getting around. The staff were very helpful and happily made bookings for us for the Uffizzi gallery and called taxis and suggested buses to get to Siena. There was only one morning shift older fellow who got a bit short with our battles with the internet when he was trying to do his bookwork !The continental breakfasts were plentiful and the pastries fresh and the room was not huge, but certainly not cramped. The en-suite bathroom however (Room 26) was enormous and had a toilet built for giants. Quite fun dangling ones legs while sitting on the loo !There is internet in the reception area, but no wireless in the bedrooms.Don't always believe their restaurant suggestion, Lobs seafood bistro was truly awful, but Enzo's around the corner was wonderful.Florence in general. Take the bus from the airport to town, it is much cheaper than the taxi. There are no signs to the bus stop, but look for a blue bus on the other side of the taxi area. Do try the touristy hop-on, hop-off bus. We got two full days use for our 鈧?0. (24 hour tickets must be for 24 working hours). It gave us an idea of the layout of the city, and gave us some background and saved our weary feet.Do go to Feosole, it is lovely and the views are amazing. Catch the No 7 bus from the main station (SMN - Santa Maria Novella station). When they say validate your bus ticket on the bus - this means pushing it into the slot in a machine in the bus where it stamps your start time on the ticket. Your ticket will then be valid for the next hour (day/week, depending what you bought) and you do not have to validate it again in that time.Try the galleries and museums just before they close to avoid the huge queues. Reserve tickets before going to the busier ones.Beware of the chianti tours - the one I went on dragged on. We were taken via a scruffy village, a wine producing castle (interesting) and the left to hang around for an hour or so with nothing to do before going back. Enjoy.

<Content>Good Location Excellent location - just a couple of minutes from the main station Santa Nouvella. and also the sights of florence that one wants to see.Rooms were very clean and so were the baths. The rooms are generally small as in the case of most city centre hotels in Europe. Breakfast was a large and good spread from cereals to sweet breads and fruits with cold meats and cheese with super coffee.Staff were very friendly and they made sure I got a top floor rooms as I had requested one with views and I could see the Duomo over the florence sky line- Great Hotel will stay again.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel  We really enjoyed this small hotel. It was conveniently located near the train station and an easy walk to the sites. The rooms were very clean, a little small, but well priced. We stayed in the hotel twice and they were very helpful when we needed to change our dates on short noticed. The breakfast was excellent and very hearty. The breakfast room is a little tight, but the service was great. Definitely a place we would stay again.

<Content>not very good hotel We spent here one night after spending two night in Caravaggio hotel, very close to this one. Wish we could have stayed longer in Caravaggio. Hotel Sempione was more expensive and worse in general. Old furniture, small bathroom... I have to say our views was excellent, but we have other priorities. The street is noisy but we were on the top floor. 10 minutes away from the Duomo. Breakfast room not nice, very small, but breakfast ok. Wouldn't recommend it unless the price was half it is.

<Content>Little Gem This small hotel was a treat. Spotless homely rooms, pleasant service, handy location (we walked everywhere), lovely breakfast room with attentive service - and good prices available if booked on the internet or through the hotel booking service at Italy's railway stations.

<Content>Good room, great location My wife and I stayed only one night but wish we could have stayed longer. The hotel is very nice and clean. We enjoyed the little balcony on the room also.  We made a mistake and took a taxi from the train station to the hotel because we didnt know exactly where it was. We both laughed when we found out it would have been easier walking to the hotel rather than take the taxi. We can actually see the station down the street from the front of the hotel. The location is central just about everything a tourist would like to see. The breakfast was also very good. This hotel is a very good value and we will stay there again.

<Content>Good value, convinient location We were very pleased with this hotel. The location can鈥檛 be better 鈥?it is just minutes away from the central train station. The street is quiet at night - you are guaranteed a good night sleep. Hotel accommodations fully conform to the description on the website.Our room was comfortable size (for European standards), clean, with spacious bathroom that has a full size shower cabin and even bide. The staff is friendly and English-speaking.The breakfast buffet was better than what we have seen in a 3* star hotel in Rome. They offer cold cuts, breads, croissants, cheeses, and cereals so you won鈥檛 go hungry.This hotel is definitely a good-value pick, and I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to recommend it to budget travelers.

<Content>Absolutely basic, spoilt Florence for me! I disliked this hotel. It was very basic, cramped and was more like a backpackers! It was clean, bathrooms were absolutely basic in its amenities. The breakfast was in a small cramped space with hardly space for guests to move. The place spolit my stay in Florence and I couldn't wait to get out of it. If we hadn't paid ahead, we would have moved out straight away. Definately cannot recommend it.

<Content>Very friendly staff and good location I stayed at Hotel Sempione in late July and was very impressed with what the hotel had to offer for the price. Very friendly staff who spoke English fluently, Internet access (5 euros for 1 hour I think), good cold buffet breakfast with plenty of choice. Rooms were quite small but had good sized ensuite bathrooms including shower and bath. Minibar and safe in room. I would definitely stay here again - it is literally a three minute walk from Santa Maria Novella train station and about 5 minutes from Duomo (although it will take you longer because you'll get distracted by the San Lorenzo market stalls on the way!)

<Content>Nice and modern After a horrible night at a different hotel, I was pleasantly pleased by the Hotel Sempione which was walking distance from the main train station. The staff spoke English and the rooms with private bath AND air conditioning (it was very hot when I went) were not too small, clean and modern. Not only was the price extremely reasonable, but breakfast was included and internet access (for a small fee) was available on site. I would highly recommend the hotel. The only reason I did not rate it as excellent was that there was some noise heard in the rooms when people were in the hallway, but all in all the hotel is an excellent value!
