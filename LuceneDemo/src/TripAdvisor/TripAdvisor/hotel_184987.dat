<Content>I was bitten. Well it's a beautiful building with friendly, helpful staff and in a great location BUT.... I stayed there for 2 nights and was bitten, whether by bed bugs or mosquitos I don't know, but it was bad enough to make me very itchy and uncomfortable and I moved on.... To be honest, I think it was bedbugs; the sheets and blankets were threadbare, ripped and with holes in them. I would not be able to recommend this place to anyone I'm afraid.

<Content>Reasonable, professionally run but yes, risk of bedbugs Excellent location, variety of rooms with and without bath, responsible management (a plastic bag of personal items I left was there for me when I came back), ample hotwater, storage room for luggage while you travel elsewhere--but yes, I brought bedbugs back to my house once after staying there and had one bite another time so will probably not go back.. The hotel does have a vacuum cleaner, ask to have the rug vacuumed if you are there in the morning when cleaing is done. Elevator to upper floors. .

<Content>Usually very good, But I just returned from a two week trip to Mexico and stayed in the Hotel Monte Carlo coming and going and have stayed there several times in the past. This time, in Room 116, which is really the second floor, has four double beds, the bed bugs attacked me! I looked like I had the measles on inside both arms, side of neck and face. My brother who lives in Mexico uses this hotel frequently in the past with no problems. Very quaint Mexican, prices from 250 for two to 450 pesos per night for four of us. Except for this one time problem you might try it. Right around the corner is the Hotel Isabela, also OK, and has small good restaurant attached, lots of international visitors, A VIPS restaurant is just up the street and close by is Sanborns, a very nice restaurant but with American prices. About three blocks away is an internet cafe and good to print your boarding pass day before leaving for States, only 10 pesos. It is an adventure to find it up an escalator. Be sure you have enough Spanish to pull this off, or just look up phrases in travel dictionary and copy them down in writing on a piece of paper for people to read, especially in internet cafe. Accent is everything in Mexico, or you will not be understood, Water is Awa, not Agua. Mexican people are very helpful with directions, especially security cops that are in every major store on streets crowded with vendors and unbelievable noise and crowded. Walked around by myself, a red haired gringo age 60 with no problems and never felt threatened. Be sure and have hotel order cabs for you and to airport was 150 pesos with tip. Cab for two to Teotiwaucan was 600 pesos plus tip and tolls and you can come and leave when you want, not have to stay all day like with bus. Worth it unless you are on a budget. Big Catholic Church and Government buildings with Diego Rivera paintings all walking distance and all this in Socalo district. There are no rest rooms anywhere except in public buildings and be sure and carry large light weight over the shoulder bag with TP, baby wipes, and water with you while wondering around. Rest rooms seldom have paper products except in fancy places. Bottled water is cheap and everywhere so don't worry about that, but it gets tiring using bottled water to brush your teeth! Leave all jewelery home and men keep your wallet in your front pocket. Buy a cheap Timex with strap. You can exchange dollars to pesos at airport coming and going but keep at least 100 pesos to buy food or drink at the airport after you go through security. If you have any left they make for good conversation at home and for scrap books!

<Content>My 2nd home in Mexico As a flight attendant I travel the world for a living. I spend several weeks here every year since 1998. Request a room with a small balcony with a door that opens over the Avenue( Rep. de Uruguay). the owner is usually very friendly and helpful. This hotel is very basic, some have tv's others not. It is usually well-kept, clean, and even serves to park cars through the lobby throughout the day. Rates are from 10 to 15 us/day. Only 2 blocks from the Zocalo and the metro station Pino Suarez or either Isabel la Catholica. The Palacio de Bellas Artes is nearby too, as are a lot of history and architecture. Enjoy Mexico City and this hotel as much as I have and continue to . Better from single travelers by far. If you're a family, spend more somewhere else. If you're up for adventure, choose MonteCarlo. This is also where D. H. Lawrence did some of his writings, fyi. Enjoy your stay. Nos vemos, stace

<Content>Good place, good location I stayed in this place for four nights in December 2002. It's near Hotel Isabel, but on a quieter street, which should mean less street noise and a quieter place in general but also a walk down a dark narrow street late at night. I had no problems at all in the centro historico, but women or nervous types might prefer someplace else. The rooms are nice, but if you stay during the pollution season (winter, for example) be sure to plug up the door and close the windows before you go to bed to keep out the smog in the morning. My room was on an open courtyard and the smog comes right inside. After morning the smog cleared up a lot and it was fine.
