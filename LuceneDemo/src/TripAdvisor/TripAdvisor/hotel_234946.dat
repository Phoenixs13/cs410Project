<Content>So-so...but the area is great ! As a frequent traveller to Berlin, I'd say the pros and cons of this hotel compared to hotels of equal prize are as following:Pros: The neighbourhood...the hotel is located in between Oranienburger Strasse and Hackesche H枚fe which means you are equally close to great dining, shopping and transportation facilities...and only a 10 minute walk away from Alexander Platz. The elderly man who seemed to be the owner of the hotel and who recieved me on my arrival was also very nice and helpful.Cons:The room I rented was extremely small and had absolutely nothing in it but a very small bed, a small tv and a closet. The bathroom, while squeaky clean, was also fit for a midget only and lacked such facilities as a blow-dryer, shampoos etc. which are standard in most hotels of equal price in Berlin. The remote control for the TV did not work and the volume of the TV set could not be adjusted manually resulting in that the TV was on so loud I could not stand to watch it.The tram drove right underneath my window - as it must do under all the hotel's windows - creating a lot of noise. As for the lobby, the hallways, etc. the hotel is very small, dark and claustrophobic. All in all...I would say it is defintely possible to find better hotels in Berlin that are not more expensive. The Taunus is much closer to being a two-star hotel than being the three-star hotel it supposedly says it is.
