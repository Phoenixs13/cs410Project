<Content>Good value - Good location My husband and I stayed at this hotel twice in September. Our first stay was at the beginning of our tour around Japan and then decided to book it again at the end of our 3 week holiday. This hotel has excellent access to the JR train (Bakurocho Station) as one of the station exits is just a few steps from the hotel entrance and (next to 7-11). We used the JR train to get into the city from the airport. The hotel appears to have been refurbished or rebuilt earlier this year so everything is new. Room and bathroom is small (typical Japanese), but we are only in the room at night. The free breakfast is excellent - salad, hard boiled eggs, fruit, pastries, cereal, miso soup, rice cakes, juice, tea, and self serve coffee machine made from fresh ground beans. This hotel was good value for us as they have an over 50 rate, as do their other hotels in Japan, so we decided to use some of those as well. Staff friendly and helpful with adequate english. Make use of the staff for onward bookings at their hotel chain as they could acquire some rooms that were unavailable on the internet.- write down the details of what you want, it is easier for them. The free coffee machine is also available from about 3pm to 12pm? There is a laundromat on site too, and free internet in the lobby. This hotel is about a 10-15 min walk from Akihabara Station. We paid approx AUD$108 for a double room at the discounted over 50 rate. Travel light - often the stations are not fully serviced with escalators or lifts, so you will have to cart your suitcase up some stairs - as is the case with Bakurocho Station. Happy travelling!
