<Content>Gross A single night in Seattle was made incredibly unpleasant by staying at The Baroness. The building lobby was under renovation and the area was very noisy beginning at 6:30 a.m. There is no air conditioning at the hotel and we were given a fan to help cool off the room on a day that was 32C/90F. The rooms are old and dingy and only the lobby is currently being renovated. The price may be low compared to other hotels in downtown Seattle, but it was not a bargain given what poor shape the hotel is in. Parking costs an additional $13 and is located a block away. Walking back to the hotel from the parking garage would be very difficult for someone who is not in good physical shape since there is quite a hill between them. I would never stay here again or recommend this property.
