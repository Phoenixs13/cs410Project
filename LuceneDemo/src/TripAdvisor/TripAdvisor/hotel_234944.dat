<Content>ok but very boring stayed for 3 nights in a small dbl room. the room was warm, well cleaned, bathroom had a tub and was clean and well functioning too. breakfast was ok, with a decent selection of breads, cereals etc. tv had only german channels and there was no internet available in the rooms.the person in the night watch, in charge of letting late arrivals in, was a bit suspicious and not too friendly, but this might be a language barrier thing too.even though there are all sorts of services in the vicinity, including a supermarket open until 24.00, i found the area around nollendorfplatz very boring. would not choose this hotel if I wanted to experience any culture in berlin. luckily the u-bahn (line U3) station is a stone's throw away, which makes this hotel a option worth considering if you want to be somewhat in the city but have errands at the freie universit盲t campus, which is also on the U3 line.would be 3/5 if they had internets and english-language TV (and if I hadn't found the location so boring.)

<Content>cant go wrong with this hotel slap bang in the gay area of berlin it has a mixed clientel. ive stayed here on many occasion. most rooms have now been refurbished to a good standard. they say you get what you pay for but with this place you cant go wrong. the newer rooms are light and airy, some with private bathrooms, pay less and you share a bathroom on the landings. its centrally located with a 2 minute walk to nollendorfplatz station. i cantcomment on the breakfast because ive never been awake at that time to try it.id happily recommend this place to anyone.

<Content>Location was great! This hotel was in a centralized location and was very affordable. The breakfast was filling and the service was friendly. It is close to the U-Bahn station and two stops away from the Zoo Bahnhof. There are a variety of restaurants nearby. We would stay there again!

<Content>Loved tghe Sachsenhof Sachsenhof is a comfortable Hotel on Nollendorfstrasse in the heart of the gay nightlife area. The rooms are small and clean. Some have separate bathrooms which are also clean. Safe, secure, hospitable and inexpensive. You can't go wrong.
