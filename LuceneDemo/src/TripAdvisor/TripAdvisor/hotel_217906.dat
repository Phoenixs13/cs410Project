<Content>Basic but pleasant This hotel is set in a quiet residential area, so a bit scary if you've never been to Berlin before because it feels very far from anything touristy. The hotel doesn't have a lift, so we had to walk up two flights of stairs with our bags. The hallway carpet is rather grotty, with patches where they have replaced a small section with a newer piece, which rather stands out. We booked a 'large' double room, which was of reasonable size and obviously used to be just one room when the whole floor was one large apartment. The smaller rooms have partition walls which aren't too soundproof, and really are very small. Our room had twin beds with individual sheets and a really thin duvet each. The bathroom was on the small side, with just a shower cubicle (none of the rooms have a bath as far as I can tell), sink and WC. The lino flooring was clean but showing some wear and tear. Our room did have a balcony, however, which we didn't pay extra for, shame it never got the sun in March. For breakfast there is a reasonable selection of cheese, ham, salami, fruit juice, cereal, bread, yoghurt and fruit. There is also a self-service hot breakfast section, offering scrambled egg, sausage, and sausage patties. The hot food wasn't very well stocked when I was there, and the scrambled egg had a very strange consistency, like a yellow savoury Aero bar. Solid with bubbles in.For a non-touristy Berlin experience I would recommend this though.

<Content>Home away from Home Sorry to be so late with this review. I stayed at the Hotel Hansablick for 5 days at the beginning of September 2007. I loved this hotel. It is located inside of a still existing apartment complex , so one feels like one is not really a tourist, but lives in a residential neighborhood. This neighborhood is called Tiergarten, which is located between the Tiergarten and the Spree River. A short walk across the street and you are on the banks of the Spree River, where there are lovely trails to walk. The walking trails along the river will lead you all the way to many attractions. The hotel is also convenient to public transportation (the S Bahn and the U-Bahn). The staff is very friendly; after the second day they remembered that I liked two pitchers of coffee instead of one with my breakfast. The coffee they made was very good, by the way. The breakfast buffet was very diverse. Always plenty of food and a large variety of items. My room was huge; I had a balcony with a view of the Spree river. The rooms have high ceilings and original art. Ladies: THEY HAVE A MAKE-UP MIRROR -- big plus. They also have a nice little cart in the bathroom which fit all of your personal items very nicely. The room was cleaned well. They have a computer in the lobby for all guests to use for free. I'm probably forgetting something, but here it is, for now. I would definitely return to this hotel when in Berlin. Berlin is awesome, by the way. Definitely worth a visit (my 5 days were way too short -- will return for more next time.)

<Content>Great Find in Berlin! I had the lowest category room in the hotel but the room was nicely appointed (room safe, TV, WIFI, new furnishings, art and design with a modern, hip, flair), with a spacious bathroom, large armoire - all spotlessly clean and refreshed daily. The (price included) breakfast buffet was lavish with hot and cold items, endless coffee and fresh fruit. The location is excellent next to the Tiergarten S-Bahn so easy to get anywhere including to/from Tegel for 2 euros! Also right on a bike/wlaking path up and down the Spree River so it is perfect for quiet strolls, biking or jogs. The hotel provides free WIFI plus a PC station for those without a computer. The staff gladly researched information if they didn't happen to know it. I couldn't have been more pleased. Superb value for money.
