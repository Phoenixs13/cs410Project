<Content>Affordable and Friendly Berlin Hotel I stayed here on a recent group visit to Berlin and the Free University (walking distance) and was very happy with this quaint pension in a leafy district of Berlin. The hotel is located across the street from S-bahn station (Botanical Garden). Even though downtown Berlin is just a few minutes away by train, this university neighborhood near the botanical gardens was quiet after dark. The rates were cheap and for an additional $5 we enjoyed a traditional German breakfast with bottomless coffee or tea in the breakfast room (the patio table is the best). The manager spoke English, Polish, and German quite well and helped our group get taxis, train maps, and printed boarding passes for our group. Since there were refrigerators in some rooms the grocery on the first floor was a handy option for snacks. There are several restaurants, little shops, and bakeries within walking distance. They are a cash only hotel but helped some pay using other forms of payment like pay pal. I would stay here again without a doubt.
