<Content>Fine when passing through mexico city We booked the hotel before travelling to Mexico City and wanted someplace central and our friends recommended this hotel.The hotel is ok for just a few nights. Dont expect luxury in any way but if you're travelling on a budget this is a good way to go. The rooms are fine, just make sure you dont get a room facing the road - unless it's higher than 3rd floor it's too much noise. They have carpet which makes it a little hard to clean properly, but considering the price it's something you can probably live with.The breakfast buffet is recommendable when comparing to nearby restaurants. The staff is not good at english, but there's always a manager around who does speak english.The hotel can arrange taxi service which is supposedly safer than getting a cab in the street. Just make sure you agree on a fixed price - it's not a guarantee from the hotel that the driver won't take you for a longer ride :(

<Content>I read the reviews.. and was terrified when hotwire assigned me this hotel. Hard beds, slept on softer park benches, slow hot water..but staying four days..i was really impressed with everything else. Large, clean room, no bugs, accessable air condition control that stayed on all night. On the fringe of the main drag with a couple of run down buildings nearby. 4 long blocks from reforma. The staff is really professional, giving my friend an umbrella when she lost hers, finding tickets to a sold out ballet..a couple of hours before it started, the hotel cheffure/ taxi, took us to san angel, zoloco, dropped us off and came back to the exact location, hours later to the minute we asked him to pick us up.Left laundry at desk, and later that day, they were ready and placed in my closet. I was really impressed with the service..I tip my hat to the staff that made our trip an experience. a great one, i was so moved at the warmth, freindlyness and a wanting to please. of not only the staff but the mexican people as a whole, poor but proud.

<Content>You gel what you pay for... well, if your objective is to not spend a lot of money, this is for you. The area is just near everything, the bed is HARD and the decor is not only outdated (not important) but not in good condition. The front desk was nice, but do not ask for them to call for a taxi: you will pay $ 100 for a $20 trip. I wish we selected another one... Mexico city is great!

<Content>Disastrous and Deceptive Where do I begin? On the first morning (Thursday, 5/17) the 7am breakfast buffet wasn't ready until after 8:30 AM. A serving spoon was dropped on the floor while they were trying to light the sterno-type heat source. The spoon was placed directly back on the table for use by the next unsuspecting guest. I was told the delay was because the waiter (only 1?) called in sick that day. I didn't return for breakfast the next day. I subsequently went to Sanborn's for better service, food, price, and cleanliness.Many extra charges are not clearly disclosed, i.e. INTERNET ACCESS: 25 pesos (about $2.50) per hour. I inquired about the charges, asking the Front Desk Manager, Mr Alejandro Cortes de Leon (who was not only rude but also completely unhelpful throughout my stay) about the multiple 25 peso charges on my bill. I speak Spanish, so there was no difficulty in communication. His response was, basically, Nope. That's the price. Whether you use the internet for one minute or one hour. Take it or leave it. LAUNDRY CHARGES are not posted ANYWHERE. There is no way to determine the cost of laundry until your bill arrives. Of course, at that time it's too late to dispute any of the charges.ROOM ISSUES: 1. HOT WATER on most attempts took at least ten minutes to arrive at my shower head in room 701. I had to get into the habit of turning on the water 10 minutes before I needed to shower.2. ADDITIONAL BOTTLED WATER is charged at almost double the rate posted in the room. Each room is given 2 small bottles daily and charged for additional bottles via the Room Service bill, WITH A SERVICE CHARGE added. I went to 7-11 after that.3. A/C remote control is attached to the wall, encased in a plexiglass housing (to prevent theft, apparently) making it almost impossible to see the controls, much less to use them. 4. There is NO bathroom phone, operational cable TV (4 channels, none of them in English), or In Room Bar (it's an empty fridge) contrary to the company's claim on their website. The in-room Safety Deposit Box is a metal safe sitting loosely on the shelf, and is easily removed from the closet.5. The furniture is very worn and tattered, so much so that I CUT OPEN MY RIGHT THIGH on a nail sticking out of the chair resulting in a significant amount of bleeding. Again the front desk manager, Mr Alejandro Cortes de Leon, was extremely unhelpful when I called for assistance. He came up to my floor but proceeded to chat with the maintenance crew for TEN MINUTES in the hall outside my door before knocking to provide assistance. His only concern was that the nail be hammered back into the chair. No apology, no offer of assistance. His response was, Well, what do you want us to do? He sent up a bottle of alcohol.6. Do Not Disturb signs are simply not available. I was repeatedly awakened several times each morning by the housekeeping staff.7. If you like to sleep on the floor, you'll LOVE the rock hard beds!Avoid this hotel at all costs! They are deceptive, dishonest, and completely unhelpful. Just about the worst I have stayed in anywhere around the world, at any price, especially in Mexico City. There are far better choices in and around the Zona Rosa.

<Content>Priceline Is At Fault That I Stayed In This Hotel The hotel is dirty and the location is poor, but the staff was agreeable. This is not, as PRICELINE suggests, a 3-star hotel.In fact, PRICELINE does not list this hotel if you search for a 3-star hotel in Mexico City's Zona Rosa, so I was shocked when I was booked into this hotel AT A HIGHER PRICE THAN I could have arranged directly. PRICELINE insists this is a 3-star hotel and would not budge. I will never stay at Zona Rosa again, but more importantly, I will never accept PRICELINE's hotel ratings again, and neither should you.I'm not angry with Zona Rosa. It is what it is. But it is not a 3-star hotel. I'm totally angry with PRICELINE. My wife was very upset for days. Other than our one night here, we had a fantastic time in Mexico. We easily found wonderful hotels everywhere we went. Too bad PRICELINE is too incompetant and unprincipled to do the same.

<Content>Worst Hotel I've Ever Stayed In Having made my reservation for the hotel through Expedia, I arrived on December 25, 2005. Apparently, the two queen-sized beds in the hotel's listing were a misprint and my directions for an extra-clean room had not been read, and I was given a room different from the one described. When I walked in, I almost feinted: the once-white walls were smeared grey, brown, and black; there was dirt everywhere--on the floor, beds, and furniture; there was fecal matter all over the toilet and on the bathroom floor; one of the bed spreads was missing; and someone had obviously been sitting on one of the beds. The manager was exremely discourteous and refused to try to accommodate my family and me in any way, and actually accused me of making the mess, in spite of my having been in the room for only two minutes. I suddenly found myself walking through Mexico City on Christmas Day, searching for a different hotel. Luckily for me, I am fluent in Spanish, and I've been to Mexico City before; I don't even want to imagine how the circumstances might have been if I had not known my way around the city. In short, this was the worst hotel experience I've ever had in years of travel, and I would warn anyone tempted by the sub-$100 price to stay far away from this hotel. Expedia was nice enough to give me a coupon for a future reservation, but the memory of this experience still disgusts and angers me.

<Content>Street noise, inadequate curtains, bad food, no English channels on TV Nice, comfortable room, but bothered by street noise and light coming in through curtains that didn't close all the way. As in most of Mexico City, the food at the hotel was horrible! The staff offered friendly, helpful service, but I ordered breakfast from room service three days out of four and they got the order wrong all three times!! On the fourth day, I had breakfast in the restaurant and they got the order wrong again! Also, there was an extremely limited number of channels on the TV, none in English, not even CNN or BBC, but I'll admit it was kind of fun watching live NFL games dubbed over in Spanish by a couple guys watching them in a studio. Not really a bad experience, but I can't honestly recommend the place.

<Content>Good hotel, cute rooms My partner and I (lesbian couple) stayed here one night only. The hotel has friendly staff and the room we got was big and cute. The place is an old building with character and the room had a window seat built in and an alcove with a huge vase for decoration. It also had a nice sitting area, a big king bed, and a nice tiled bathroom. Very close to the zona rosa but on a quiet street.

<Content>Great welcome and good value It's a little outside the Zona Rosa, but in terms of price and welcome, I think it would be hard to beat. We also stayed in a glitzy five-star hotel slap bang in the middle of the Zona Rosa, and wished we'd returned here instead. It was so much more friendly and has a much better atmosphere. Rooms are really spacious with good views, the restaurant is good, and the staff really are some of the nicest people I've ever met. Nothing was too much trouble for them.
