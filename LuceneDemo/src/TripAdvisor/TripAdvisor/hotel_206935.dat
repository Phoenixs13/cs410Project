<Content>fantastic full breakfast in general I'm giving 4 points, thanks to delicious openbar breakfast and huge kingbed, also not too far from the Ramblas and old town. nice and kind staff. what we liked less: even though we had a one double bed booked, they offered us a twin, and only because it was quite early we had a last chance to change it to king (last one they said); stinky (but clean) bathroom due to damp; loud (malfunctioned?) air conditioning. otherwise really good weekend experience!

<Content>good location, decent price Besides good location, fair price and meeting the standards of a 4 star hotel, it was great to find free internet available. I think the hotel should inform the customers who have a car about the discounted parking fee in a better way.

<Content>Better than expected A fairly long walk from the main 'Ramblas' (30 mins?) and also, therefore, the old quarter but closer to the cathedral and still a wide range of Tapas bars within easy reach.For a top destination like Barcelona we felt that 120 Euros for two nights in an above average hotel was excellent value.

<Content>Good safe location The hotel was in the business and shopping district. It had free internet access and a refrigerator in the room. The metro was not far away -- about 5 minutes -- and there were good restaurants nearby. We especially liked Mussol right around the corner on Diagonal Ave. Flash!Flash! had good frittata style omelets, but rolls to accompany them cost 2 euros each.

<Content>Just OK The hotel was tucked away in a quiet area of Barcelona in the financial area. A five-10 minute walk to the nearest Metro and Bus Turistic stops. The rooms were neat and clean. The free continental breakfast was OK. What I was most annoyed with was the blase attitude of some of the staff. Depending on who was at the desk, service or questions about the city could be like a trip to the dentist. They did not go out of the way to offer advice. Also, don't look for restaurants near the hotel. Most better places are located in more lively parts of town. The best part was the hotel had a reasonable price. Pre booked at $205 per night.

<Content>Upmarket convenient location The hotel was exactly as expected - good standard, clean and ideally situated in an upmarket neighbourhood away from the crowds but close enough to public transport to allow us to move effortlessly around the city. We found the metro cheap, efficient and easy - Diagonal being the closest to the hotel. Reception staff were friendly and helpful when approached but seemed reluctant to look up from their computers to pass the time of day - a greeting and a smile makes a big difference. The rooms were kept spotless with clean sheets and towels every day - full marks to the cleaning staff. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel because of the comments made in previous reviews - there are lots of lovely cafes within easy walking distance at half the price.Barcelona is an expensive place to visit - to save money take the bus to and from the airport - only 4euros compared to 25euros by taxi.

<Content>Good tourist hotel Stayed for 2 nights at the Balmoral for the Barcelona - Celtic game in March 2008. Hotel was ideal - pretty good location, handy for transport, spotless rooms. Didn't eat or drinnk in the hotel at all so can't comment on that. Very competitive rate considering how busy the city was.

<Content>Watch out for the cost of breakfast! We were booked in by a promoter for two nights. The hotel was pleasant and the staff seemed nice enough.The first morning we went to breakfast..There was no sign to say that it was a buffet costing Euro15, and there was no alternative menu, so I assumed that the breakfast was included in the price of the room. I had a cup of tea. The 2nd morning I had a cup of tea and a slice of toast.When we went to check out we found that breakfast was not included and so my two cups of tea and slice of toast cost the promoter Euro 30.I tried to argue the point with the desk manager, but he was extremely rude and unhelpful, as was the other man on the desk.In the end we were going to be late for our flight home and had to drop the matter.I have stayed in hotels all over the world and have never come across such rudeness. Neither have I ever known any hotel not make it clear, or offer an alternative menu, when breakfast is not included in the price of the room.

<Content>A Great Hotel Great Location Stayed at BALMORAL last week end Service could not be faulted Room was excellent, clean sheets and Towels everyday. Well done Stella (our elusive chambermaid).Right in the middle of the exclusive financal area of Barcelona - Really good shops around the vacinity of the hotelLocated only a few mins walk from the Metro, where the trains are very frequent.and clean.Don't forget to buy the Very cheap T10 ticket which almost lasted for the whole week end - this is valid for all transport .Barcelona is not cheap so don't think it is, especially around the Ramblas where meals are extortionately priced and have a 7% service charge added on. Tip if you wish???All in all Barcelona is a wonderful city the people were friendly and the sights awsome - plenty going on even a Mexican concert in the Gothic square off the Ramblas dancing and mexican bands- Wonderful!

<Content>definately 2 star 2 friends and myself stayed for a week at this hotel, check in was straightforward, however we were not made aware that we should pay a 20 euro deposit to obtain a remote control for the aircon, therefore thinking that it was just broken suffered for almost 3 days in sweltering heat, until a friend we had made on holiday put the aircon on 4 us using her remote, we had reported a failure to the reception, no one came to fix it and still no one told us we needed the control. our bathroom door locked itself and it took maintenance 2 hours to come open it for us. however the rooms were clean and the maid service was excellent.the food was terrible, you could get an english breakfast, but most of the food was cold, and the spanish guests pushed in front of other people which i found very rude. anyone could walk in off the streets and eat in the restaraunt because there was only someone checking your room keys on admission 3 times in the week we stayed. the bar staff were either miserable or trying it on us which made it uncomfortable going to get a drink.the location was ok, but the bins by mcdonalds did stink.thank goodness the weather was great.

<Content>Great hotel, not so great service This hotel would have got a 4, or even a 5 had it not been for our experience on the last day. On the final morning I requested to book a taxi for later that day. The receptionist said that would be no problem - just contact them about 15 minutes before we were due to leave and they would call for one.When we went to leave the hotel at 3.30pm we requested the hotel called a taxi to take us to the airport. A different receptionist said there would be plenty on the road outside and to just flag one down. After 20 minutes standing outside in the rain trying to hail a taxi we returned and asked the hotel to phone for a taxi. A combination of rain and siesta time meant vacant taxis were fairly low on the ground.The receptionist refused! He said the taxi number would 'probably' be engaged so it wasn't worth trying and that we would be able to flag one down quicker. I explained that I'd already waited on the main road for 20 minutes, and insisted he at least try and phone a taxi for us. He would not budge and was extremely rude in his manner.For any hotel, let alone 4 star, I find this level of service totally unacceptable. If it weren't for time constraints (we had a plane to catch) I would have pursued the matter with the manager. Luckily a further 10 minutes in the rain saw a taxi finally displaying a green light.As I said above, had this incident not happened, I would have awarded the hotel a 4 or a 5. The location was excellent, just outside the main hub of the city, but well within walking distance of the main attractions, with the tube 5 minutes away when we didn;t feel like walking.The room was spacious enough, and immaculate throughout - and the maids daily visit ensured it stayed that way.Breakfast was better than average on the Continent with a buffet including hot food as well as the traditional cold meat and cheeses.I would stay again, but would insist on the morning of departure that a taxi is booked.

<Content>Great hotel in a good location We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. The location is near the diagnoal metro stop and buses 16, 17, 22, 24 and 28. It was very central near Casa Mila and other Gaudi sites. It is near the P. de Gracia as well. It was close enough (about a 10 minute bus ride) to Plaza de Catalynua and the Ramblas.. The hotel staff was excellent. Maria helped us plan our days, called the Renfe and other restaurants to find opening times as our spanish was limited. The rooms were clean  very nice.The management even accomodated a change in our stay once we had arrived - they were superb!Would definitely recommend - I booked this hotel through bancotel and paid 50 euros per night.

<Content>OK Hotel with Good Access My wife and I spent four nights at the Balmoral in September 2004. It is a few steps from Calle Diagonal, a main street through Barcelona that gives you access to buses and a few blocks from the Diagonal Metro stop at Rambla Catalunya. It is a Four Star Occidental hotel, but the rooms we had were pequeno (small) and located on the center court-yard, which in this case was the neighborhood backyards. Actually, not a bad room because the Via Augusta has some traffic during the day. Our room was quiet and had a window that opened. The facilities, although clean, were small and oversold on their website. The desk is relatively efficient, but there is no concierge, and one desk person refused to confirm flights and transfers to the airport. English was not a problem, but I speak some Spanish and made myself undestood when necessary.The restaurant on the evening we stayed for dinner was not particularly good, as there were few selections left, and our entrees were barely edible. Other restaurants in the area are superior.We would have reservations about staying there again.

<Content>Quiet and Close to All in the City The Balmoral Hotel on Avenue Augusta is right off Avenue Diagonal and close to the bus stop that takes you to the Forum (Balmes-Paris) and also close to Avenue Gracia which has the Tourist Bus routes - both red and blue. The hotel was quiet and some rooms have small balconies. The hot buffet breakfast was convenient.The main drawback was lots of cigarette smoke every where you went in Barcelona, however, non-smoking laws go into effect December 31, 2004, to give us a little more clean air.One other drawback is that there is a peculiar odor in the air at times in Barcelona (sewage?) due to some of the city being built on reclaimed land. Perhaps it is better in cooler weather

<Content>We'd stay again! We stayed in this hotel in February, on a mid week break. The rooms were very comfortable, staff were very good, and although not all were fluent in English (  why should they be! ) we had no difficulties in obtaining excellent service. We had booked on a bed  breakfast basis, but used the restaurant for some of our evening meals aswell; the standard of cuisine was excellent. Hotel Balmoral is about a 10 minute walk from the main centre of Barcelona, but the taxi service in the city is superb, and the metro station is not too far away if you want tio try that. We would happily return.
