<Content>Best I've stayed in in Paris, by far I wanted to take friends for a weekend break from London and as is often the case, was worried that they would either be (a) tiny (b) noisy (c) miles away (d) if central, pleasant and roomy, then fantastically expensive, pretentious etc. as I've often found. The Saint James was for me and my friends a terrific surprise. It looks a bit out of the way on the map but it's 10 minutes walk from the Trocadero and Etoile, and 2 minutes from a metro (line 2). Very peaceful. Very friendly indeed. Gracious, impressive and above all - roomy. We had two top floor rooms which were reasonably expensive but nothing like what I saw advertised closer in at the usual grand places. Very comfortable, large and peaceful. It is slightly old fashioned but that suits me very well indeed. No snooty staff in black, no clouds of perfume or loud lounge music. I found it very pleasant to walk a few blocks to get to shops, sights, metro etc. and loved the peaceful neigbhbourhood. I think this is the best hotel in Paris - by a mile. It has transformed my experience of the city! I used to dread booking there either for discomfort or amazing cost - now ... well, I sound like an advertisement. Special mention should go to the extremely friendly and helpful staff - especially in a city rightly famous for poor service. Well done. I will be back many times.

<Content>Above average customer service! What can I say about the Saint James? The front desk clerks and the concierge were outstanding and answered our questions in a friendly and clear manner.They went out of their way to assist my friend with her special needs. They arranged taxi pickups with a friendly smile and also arranged our day and night trip in and around Paris. The room was extremely spacious and clean. It was truly a home away from home. The staff will go out of their way to accomodate you in every way possible. I highly recommend it.

<Content>A wonderful oasis of Parisien calm in the peaceful 16th arrondisement. My husband and I have recently returned from a memorable 16 day holiday at this lovely hotel and we cannot recommend it too highly. It was the most peaceful holiday we have ever had and since it was combined with a nearby hospital visit for me it was a perfect recovery base and a general place to beneficially unwind and chill out. It is in walking distance to the lovely Bois de Boulogne and the beautiful Pre Catalan restaurant is a short cab trip away. We also went back to our old favourite the wonderful La Fermette Marboeuf whose food now matches up to the beautiful decor. The nearby metro Port Dauphine or RER Avenue Foch takes you into the heart of Paris in minutes. Staying here puts you within easy access to the gardens at Monceau and the lovely little areas of Passy and Auteuil. As we know Paris very well indeed it was a change for us to just enjoy living at the hotel and in this quiet residential area. The hotel lunches in the garden were wonderful on a summer's day and on some evenings we had very nice dinners delivered to the room. We were given a lovely de luxe room which we found spacious with every comfort and with windows opening out on to the front of the building. We could not fault our stay in any way. The breakfast was generous and we were fortunate enough to have it included in our very good deal through Expedia. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We loved the St James and would certainly return.

<Content>Big disappointment We have stayed in various Paris hotels over the years and because we like the 16th, we chose the St. James for a three night stay even though it is a bit out of the way. Our check in was a huge disappointment as the top floor of the hotel does not correspond with the room numbers. We had seem pictures of the 300 level but the third floor is actually the 500 level. The rooms are like dungeons with no windows to look out of. We asked to be relocated which was done after much discussion at the front desk. Our next room was quite spacious but very tired, with stained carpet and sofas very worn out. However, what killed out stay was the fact that the hotel had a problem with hot water-there was none-and after repeated assurances that it would be fixed, it was still not fixed the following day. We checked out early and received a token discount from our room rate as compensation for our troubles. This is not at all what you would expect from a 4 star hotel.

<Content>An island in Paris. Nice hotel. It is a bit out of the way. There is a Metro stop (Porte Dauphine, Line 2) a short block away. The neighborhood is very nice and very safe to walk in. There are many embassies in the area, so a lot of security. There are a few restaurants to walk to that are good. Your are not getting any cheap eats in this neighborhood though.The hotel is a bit worn but very comfortable. We had a very large room. The service and the staff are among the best I have ever experienced. There are no language barriers. The hotel is very quiet.The breakfast (which was included) was a good start to the day. I had an omelette from room service that was good but we did not try the restaurant. We used Parishuttle to get to and from the airport. If you want to be in the hustle and bustle this is not a hotel for you. If you are looking for some relaxation and pampering while in Paris you may enjoy this hotel.

<Content>Nice Place We stayed at this hotel for a week in July 2004, along with some friends (in total, we had three rooms). The good: It is a gorgeous hotel that was once an upscale private school. It is located on a private piece of property, with a garden, on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood - well off the beaten path. The rooms are huge and immaculate (a large bedroom, a large sitting room, large bath, huge windows, etc.) The metro is less than a block away (two short stops to the main line (#1)). Most of the cafes are a few blocks away, around Blvd. Victor Hugo. Since there are only 40 rooms, and many staff, there are many staff members per guest, all of whom went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and enjoyable. The hotel bar is one of the best I've ever seen (it is in the old school library), and the bartender has been working there since the hotel opened. Hotel has an Internet wireless hotspot that worked well. If you have a car, you can park it near the front door.The slightly less than good: The hotel is off the beaten path, so you lose some convenience. E.g., most of the sights require a metro ride or a taxi ride. Taxis must be ordered by phone. Altough the hotel has air conditioning, the air conditioning in our three rooms was inadequate when the temperature outside approached 80 degrees F, especially at mid-day. By bed time, however, the rooms were usually comfortable. Overall, the good substantially outweighed the slightly less than good.

<Content>Elegant, 5-Star Quality, Treated Like Royalty The Saint James, Paris is by far the nicest hotel in which I've stayed. Not only are the spotless accommodations spacious (almost on a grand scale), but the staff almost anticipates your every need. A free internet-connected computer is at your disposal in the lobby, and the two-story Library is a perfect spot to relax and unwind. We found this hotel purely by accident--the Golden Tulip Washington Opera in the 1st District insisted that our reservation had been cancelled, leaving us needing two rooms for four nights for five people. (Please carefully read all reviews--now I know that this is a common practice at the Golden Tulip Washington Opera). At any rate, we found immediate availability with Saint James, Paris (in the 16th District). I was at first concerned with its location, having only stayed in Paris' 1st District, but found the Metro very easy to use and convenient--a few blocks away. A small but well-stocked market is located just up the street. Cafe Stella is also very close and has wonderful offerings. I whole-heartedly recommend this hotel and will definitely return.

<Content>Saint James - an oasis of calm I stayed in the Saint James hotel for 5 nights in August 2002. The hotel is beautiful and service is excellent and friendly. Room service (food)was not very impressive and this put me off going to the hotel's main restaurant.However it is set in a beautiful location with a wonderful garden and fountain and the staff are extremely discreet and helpful. I was in Paris visiting my french lover and it was a wonderful place to have as a base. As a tourist you are very near to Porte Dauphine metro and the beautiful Avenues Victor Hugo and Foch.My room was decorated in the art-deco style and I even had a little (internal) terrace under the conservatory roof. Comfortable and romantic.
