<Content>dont stay here or Pension baha or las ramblas i was sent here after their sister hotel Pension Bahia said they had no trace of my internet booking (i showed them the confirmation number + print out) conveniently she could no longer speak english.took me 1 hour to find the dingy picasso. woman here equally unfriendly and said didnt speak english or spanish and claimed to be french. i spoke french to her and she pretended not to understand.room like a prison cellno breakfast as was advertised on my original bookingno sleep what so ever noise mainly from outside. but some inside1 shower for seemingly every onedrugged out african prostitues hasseling me and even folowing me at night all bars and cafes overpriced and very poor quality.las ramblas is overated. only a few streets away the prices come down and quality gets better. no way would locals pay 5.50 euros for a beer and 7.50 for a sandwhich and small coffee.everything you want to see in barcelona is not on las ramblas anyway so do yourself a favour and get a proper hotel elsewhere it will be better value in the long run.

<Content>Not good but not bad either The place was quite hard to find and once we got there the lady on reception was really grumpy. She didn麓t show us where the shower or toilet was (thankfully we found the latter after exploring a little but still couldn麓t find the shower). The room was tiny but did have a double bed (a rarity in Europe).

<Content>Do not expect to sleep a wink! This pension couldnt be in a better location for visiting the Ramblas area of Barcelona by DAY unfortunately when you return to your accomodation at NIGHT you will find you are situated in the dodgiest RED LIGHT AREA and it has a completly different feel. I was astonished to find a hole in the wall at the side of the hotel which is a bar with the whole street becoming incredibly LOUD street party style every night. Do not expect to sleep a wink till at least 8am due to the noise then get woke up at 12 by the maid. What was supposed to be a rest for me ended up wearing me out!! This place is more suited to late night party animals than quiet couples wanting a quiet break.However if your idea of soaking up the local culture involves getting oral by a black transvestite hooker this hotel could not be better situated. Enjoy your stay!
