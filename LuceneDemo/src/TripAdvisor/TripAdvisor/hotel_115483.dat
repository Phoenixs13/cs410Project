<Content>No Interruptions, Please My husband  I were in Phoenix for an extra night due to a cancelled flight. The airline suggested the Hampton Inn on South 48th Street. The shuttle driver was very nice.About a half hour after we checked in, the phone rang. We were puzzled, as no one could possibly know where we were. It was the desk clerk, asking us how we liked the room. I've never had this happen at any hotel before [even Hampton Inn's at other locations]. A few hours later, we heard noise by the door of our room, and found a copy of the bill had been slipped under the door. At every other hotel I've stayed at, I've gotten this paperwork while checking out, or occasionally, while checking in.At 8:30 am, a knock at the door from housekeeping woke us from a sound sleep. Check out was at noon, and there was no Do Not Disturb sign available for us to use. I've never before stayed at a hotel for a single night where the housekeeping staff showed up before check out time. They knew we were checking out that day, and the room would have to be completely stripped at that time, so what was the rush? And if early-morning housekeeping is the practice at this hotel, why no Do Not Disturb signs for guests who prefer to actually sleep in the room they've rented?One of the things I normally find enjoyable about hotel stays is the pleasure of being undisturbed in a private space. I felt that this enjoyment was violated. The idea of hotel staff actually waking up guests hours before check out time a startling novelty.It was impossible to feel comfortable in this room. Romance was out of the question.

<Content>perfect if need a room near the airport We were on the way home and needed a place to spend the night before our flight the next day. We checked in at the hotel, then dropped our rental car off. We had to take the shuttle bus to the airport and then call the hotel, but they came right out. The room was very nice - clean comfortable and roomy. There was a fitness room, but we were too tired. It was too hot (104!) to sit by the pool. There was an English pub next door which provided a decent supper. The hotel breakfast was above average, with a nice selection including poached eggs and bakery style pastries. The hotel took us to the airport the next day. All in all, we had a very nice stay. I certainly wouldn't stay in this area unless I had a plane to catch, but if you do, this was a very nice, convenient place to stay. Under the same circumstances, I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Great value! Hampton Inn  Suites is always a cut above other hotels at this price range. We were just looking for a cheap place to stay while we visited my brother, and were pleasantly surprised with the clean, spacious, quality accommodations. Breakfast was nothing special, but I can't complain about food that is free. Fitness center wasn't much more than a couple pieces of equipment but again, it didn't cost extra. This place is a great value, the rooms are clean, comfortable, and nicer than you'll expect them to be. I recommend it for sure.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Overall Reasonable hotel, located about 15 minutes drive from the airport. Also has free shuttle service altho鈥?did not have a chance to try this option. (Did see van by hotel entrance and looked nice.) Plenty of parking. Neighborhood is just fine. 5 minutes drive from ASU.Hotel is next to highway exit. In fact, if coming from the airport, it鈥檚 easiest to take the Hohokam Expy (#143) to its final exit, or come east on Broadway Rd, as the hotel鈥檚 cross-street (48th St) does not go all the way thru鈥?going south. Hotel staff very efficient. Fastest check-in I think I鈥檝e ever experienced, and also got the type of room I had requested online. Breakfast area quite nice as was small exercise room. Free internet available. Pool area nicer than average for a mid-range chain altho鈥?not super large. (Sun gone by 3 pm.) Good maintenance overall.Room was acceptable size and very nice. Bathroom had three-tiered counter which was very useful for arranging toiletries. Only complaint was closet size. Clothes to be hung in armoire in about 2 feet of space, including where the iron and ironing board are located. OK if you鈥檙e there on business for one night. Not so good if you鈥檙e two people there for several days.

<Content>Moldy smell The price was good, but overall, the hotel had a very bad moldy/mildewy smell and there was alot of traffic noise. For this reason, I would not stay again.

<Content>Great airport transportation We stayed at the Hampton Inn and took advantage of their airport shuttle. We checked in at the hotel, took our rental car back to the airport, and then called the Hotel to come and pick us up. If you are unfamiliar with the Phoenix Airport and their transportation to rental cars, take our word for it. It's cumbersome and crowded. The shuttle from the Hampton runs 24 hours a day and takes about ten minutes to get to or from the airport. The hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly. There is an English pub attached to the hotel which has an extensive beer list and a decent menu. If you're more in the mood for quick food, there's a DelTaco nearby. The beds are extremely comfortable.

<Content>Neat And Comfortabley Homey Hampton Inns are the no-frills version of Holiday Inn. You get a nice room that is conveniently located, free parking, newspaper, coffee, continental breakfast, etc. They even put out fresh-baked cookies at the registration counter. There's also a nice outdoor pool to relax at, after your busy day. What more do you need? My wife and I love them. This particular property is only 5 mins. drive from Sky Harbor (PHX) International Airport. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great accomodation Always pleased with a Hampton Inn. This hotel was clean, quiet, close to the airport. The beds were comfortable, the staff friendly, the breakfast consistent with the chain. No unpleasant surprises here. It seemed to have quite a few business travellers so it must be popular with them too. The only negative was it was hard to access and a little hard to find the sign which was obstructed by a tree. Unless you come to it in just the right direction you may not be able to cross a median in the road to enter the parking lot. We had used mapquest to find it , and the route they told us to take made no sense at all until we arrived there. We had to go around the area in a way that allowed us to make a right hand turn into the parking lot because of a median dividing the busy road. How on earth do those people at mapquest know all this stuff?

<Content>A great hotel in Phoenix A great hotel in all respects. Room clean and quiet, bed very comfortable, bathroom immaculate. Buffet breakfast, included in price, of excellent variety. I would not hesitate to return and, based on this experience, to try other hotels in the chain. The management is to be congratulated on its standards.

<Content>Nice accomodations, great breakfast, okay area My husband and I stayed at this hotel in January 2006 for the Fiesta Bowl. This Hampton Inn was very reasonably priced compared to other hotels in the area. The hotel itself was in very nice condition. The rooms were modern and very comfortable. I don't expect much with a complimentary breakfast but this breakfast was good. The selection changed every day but it always included bagels/muffins/danishes as well as eggs/bacon/ham/pancakes etc.. There's also free parking and complimentary coffee all day in the lobby. There isn't much to do within walking distance. It's about a 5-10 minute drive to Arizona State's off-campus area for restaurants and shopping. Overall, I thought this property was a great value.

<Content>NIce property and value Stayed here start of Dec. for 2 nights. Easy freeway access. Not many restaurants in area except for Del Taco and the British Pub (good happy hour, expensive food). Very nice staff and shuttle service. Good breakfast with hot entrees and tasty coffee. Clean good sized rooms, nice bathroom. Slightly noisy through windows. Small useful fitness room and computers to use, also high-speed internet. Felt safe but area could be better. Pool looks inviting. Not in a tourist zone.

<Content>O.K., watch out for pandhandlers I stay at a lot of Hampton Inns for business and I would rate this property as O.K. The airport location is quite good and the British Pub next door is quite a trip. However, we had all sorts of problems checking in because we had two rooms with two separate reservations with the same last name and that seemed to throw off the desk clerk. This immediately followed being approached by a person in the parking lot begging for money--not all that comfortable when you are wheeling luggage and expensive computer equipment. We were told by the front desk clerk that they had been having problems with people accosting guests in the parking lot asking for money and they were working on upgrading their security measures. Until they can confidently control this, I would not recommend this property for a woman travelling alone.

<Content>great rooms I really enjoyed my stay. I was not sure what to expect, but the rooms were great. The beds were very nice and the location of the hotel was perfect. Right off the freeway, close to arizona mills mall and mills avenue. The staff was very friendly. The only thing I did not like was the elevators, they seemed to make lots of strange noises, but they worked just fine.I will stay here again in the future!

<Content>Clean n' tidy Located south of the airport (10 minutes drive away with comp shuttle). Hotel gets traffic from those driving in to fly out next day as well as passengers from cancelled flights (AmericaWest). Normally hotels with large # of 1 night stays gets worn down quickly. This property though is well maintained in better than average condition and rooms tidy and clean. Despite proximity to various highways relatively quiet. There is an English pub/rest next door where food is good -- unfortunately no other restaurant choices within walkng distance. Recommended.

<Content>A Good Place To Stay This is a really excellent place to stay close to the airport. The staff are excellent and very helpful and the rooms are clean and tidy and very well maintained. Added to that the complimentary breakfast was very good.I would have no hesitation in staying at The Hampton Inn again and would thoroughly recommend it as a good place close to the airport.
