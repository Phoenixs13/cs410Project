<Content>Great hotel---check it out WOW after reading the reviews for this hotel, I was afraid to book. But, I was only staying in Miami one night and then heading off to the port for a cruise, so I figured I could stand it for one night. After all, the price was nice, they had a complimentary shuttle bus from the airport, they would arrange my shuttle to the port at my designated time in the morning for a small fee, and they had complimentary hot breakfast and a pool. Not too bad. I was very impressed with the whole hotel. It was very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My room was very clean and tidy. The only problem I could find is that the carpet was a little worn but thats it!! I have no idea where the rest of these people stayed that left reviews!!! This is not my idea of a dream hotel but for a day or two it definately is great. The hotel is near to several restaurants and fast food chains. All within a few minutes walking distance. I would definately stay here again. No problem!

<Content>Are you going Shopping? This is the best you will get!! I was on spring brake with my 3 kids and two of my daughter friends. 3 teenagers and two toddlers. Is convenient, everything you may need is there, the location is the best ever if you are going shopping that is.Spacious, good beds and decent rooms. We are travelers and we choose the hotel depending on the occasion. We were going shopping and this worked great. I wouldn't go there if I wanted to relax in a well decorated beautiful room. The carpet is stained and the staff is not very helpful. However for the price, what you get is worth it.

<Content>Excellent Value I was checking the ratings of hotels in Miami for a one night stay and chose this hotel because it did seem quite reasonable for the price. I was pleasantly surprised, there was a free shuttle from the airport and the hotel was situated just approx 300 yards from a nice Italian Restaurant and shops. The rooms were clean with 2 double beds and decent bathroom. Continental breakfast was complimentary and there was a large clean outdoor pool. I couldnt really fault it, although it was only a one night stop over I would go again and recommend it.

<Content>Cheap in Pricing  I am not much of a hotel snob, as I haven't stayed at many hotels. However, this hotel is definitely not worth the money. The location is convenient, and on a quiet street. However, the rooms are hideous. The blankets and towels were dirty. The furniture was very old and looked unkept. The bathrooms were old and dirty too. The continental breakfast is a joke. There are bite-size bagels, and cereal in boxes. I was very glad about the cereal in the boxes, as I didn't trust their silverware. In addition, they did not refill on the food, so there was hardly anything left when we arrived for breakfast.I highly do NOT recommend this location. Please pay the additional $ to stay somewhere cleaner.

<Content>Cheap but dirty.. The dirtiest room we ever stayed at.. The toilet was just a nightmare. The carpet was sticky and under the bed it was something alive. We opened the window but could never close it again. The positive I can say is that it is cheap, has good location to the airport, and the front des staff is very polite and friendly.Stay here if you just have to find a cheap hotel for just one night.

<Content>I would stay here again We enjoyed staying at this hotel. Our room had a small refrigerator, a microwave, a coffeemaker and a small sink. The continental breakfast was delicious. They had French toast and waffles, oatmeal, fruit etc. The front desk clerk was also nice and friendly and everything was clean. The hotel was also close to a lot of restaurants and pharmacies.

<Content>Did not meet expectations We make the trip to Miami a few times a year and usually stay at the La Quinta. We thought we would try the Baymont Inn for a change this time. This was a mistake. Waited at the check in desk for a while (while two desk clerks chatted with each other) before getting service. The rooms althoug designated no smoking smelled of smoke. The room was not very clean, carpet was very dirty, expecially by the beds and nightstand. The sheets on the bed were threadbare (so thin you could see right through them). Also the beds were sagging. Had I not been so tired from the drive I would have checked out. Continental breakfast was OK but the La Quinta is better and less expensive.
