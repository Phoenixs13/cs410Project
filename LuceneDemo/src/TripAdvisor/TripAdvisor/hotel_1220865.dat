<Content>Efficiently Relaxing Experience Most effecient and very friendly staff. Was there with my family and really enjoyed the great hospitality and the rooms we got were of very high standard. What we paid was a fraction of similar hotels in Amsterdam with the type of rooms we got.Definately recommend this hotel to all.
