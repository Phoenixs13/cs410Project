<Content>Not good located The hotel is very far from the city center. The room was good but the bathroom was too small, almost impossible to take a shower. It was a terrible cigar smell. The breakfast was not good.The neighborhood was so weird.

<Content>Near the airport! My flight to Florence arrived very late, and so I chose a hotel near the airport for my first night in Italy. Thinking I could earn miles for it, I chose the Hotel Fleming. First, the front desk staff was very, very friendly. The desk attendant that evening spoke very little English, but he smiled a lot and we got through the exchange. The next morning, they called a taxi and helped me with my luggage. Everyone was so kind -- Italian hospitality at its' finest. The room was typical by European standards. I did enjoy the mini balcony, as it provided a beautiful view. The bathroom was also typical by European standards. No complaints here. The beds were not the most comfortable, but they were also fine. It was not the most convenient location to the city centre, but as I said, they were very helpful in securing a taxi. It is very convenient to the airport (a few minutes away).

<Content>Decent rooms but out of the downtown We chose the Fleming even if it was outside the core because:1. We had driven most of Northern Italy with a planned two days in Florence before a very early flight home from there. We chose to drop the car at the airport before going to a hotel.2. The hotel is close to the airport which was good after dropping the car and would be handy for an early flight. Note, there isn't a shuttle to the airport; you still have to cab it - about 12 euros including small tip.3. There is a bus stop outside the hotel with a direct route to the core area so no big deal not being right in the downtown. One euro per person for the bus including transfers within 60 minutes of validating the ticket. (buy bus tickets at the hotel desk and validate in the machine on the bus)5. It's a Best Western. We sort of knew what to expect. The price was reasonable compared to many downtown hotels.The Fleming is what we expected. The rooms were slightly larger than most European rooms but smaller than a North American BW room. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel itself is average and that was OK. That being said, the staff was better than average - very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful and while not outstanding was a good way to start the day. There may have been comparably priced hotels in the downtown core but based on what I've read/seen, the rooms would have been smaller, the breakfasts more basic and not necessarily as new/clean.Caveots are:1. There aren't any restaurants within walking distance. There is a small shop with pannini, etc. close by but the hours are sporadic. While you can get 'dinner' at the hotel, the choices are basic, frozen entrees like lasagna and some pastas - and they are NOT cheap - 14 euros got a pop, frozen lasagna and ice cream. Hey, captive market. Eat downtown but you have to cab it back or be comfortable taking the bus.2. Drinks in the hotel were very expensive - 7 euros for a simple cocktail or glass of wine.3. The bus ride did take longer than we expected and the bus does not come every six minutes like the hotel description says - more like 10 - 15 minutes but still that's not bad. This is a good hotel for a business travel who wants to be close to the airport or the nearby university/industry. Or, if you don't have time to research hotels and want Best Western consistency at a BW price. We don't regret our stay but if I had to do it again, I think I would spend a bit more and try to find a place downtown so I could walk to the sites and have easy access to restaurants.

<Content>Good if you have an early flight The only reason to stay at this hotel is because of its convenience to the Florence airport, or because business in the area requires it. That said, the people were welcoming, the room we had was spacious, clean and relatively quiet, breakfast service was unique as tour groups eat in a separate area, and the price was okay.It was hard to find by auto in the dark. Free parking was provided and the area seems safe.The room doors are covered in fabric so it is hard to knock on them!
