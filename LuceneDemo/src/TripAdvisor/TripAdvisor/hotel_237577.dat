<Content>Good if you are just going to use your room for sleeping.... This place is not as advertised on the net. It is very dark and cramped. However, the location is very good for the price. Right around the corner from the Sqaure and Leidseplein. It's very convenient in that way, you are so close to many things. Also the front desk guy was pretty nice and gave us some good advice as to where to go.If you are just planning on using your room as a simple base that will only be used for sleep this place does the trick. We had a canal view room that was pretty basic but gave a good view of the street below. It was not too loud at night, even with all the action around the corner. Also, our room was clean but I did not feel that the rest of the hotel (the stairs front halls etc) was taken care of).You must know what you are getting into with this hotel. I really would only recommend it for young people/students who need cheaper accomodations but don't want to hostel.

<Content>Dont even think about it!!!!! Horrible hotel.... stayed here about 4 years ago...wish i had known about this website then so i would have been warned off...paid abbut 100euro a night (stupidly!!)the room was like a prison cell...it was tiny and there was a tiny window looking out onto a wall...I wasnt expecting luxury but the room was supposed to have a jacuzi in the bathroom....there was no room to even turn around in the bathroom..actually the bathroom was so small the door for it slid across and didnt swing open because there simply wouldnt have been room for it to do that!!the location was good...but it doesnt make up for it! we were also charged for something from the minibar even though i told the receptionist that we didnt drink anything and he lied and said they wouldnt charge us!love amsterdam though!!

<Content>Absolutely awful place We booked this hotel on the basis of the pictures  description which we saw on the web and the fact that it was offered through Easy Book. Needless to say we got an awful shock when we actually arrived. There was graffiti on the exterior walls. The staff were rude. The interior of the hotel smelt damp and musty. The rooms were tiny and the bathrooms were filthy. The morning we were due to leave we got verbally abused by the cleaning staff (one guy) who was shouting at us and telling us to get out of room. Never ever ever again would I even consider staying in this kip of a place. It should be removed from all web sites offering hotel deals in Amsterdam. I could not believe that it was rated three stars. It's not even worth one. Again on checking out, we were charged an exorbitant rate of tax 13% where i think the usual is 5%, and of course had no other option but to pay it as otherwise it would have been charged to our credit card. I would advise in the strongest possible terms to anyone considering this place - DONT

<Content>Do not stay here ! This hotel was a damp, dirty, smelly hovel. We explored other hotels but decided to pay extra and stay at Hotel Maas because it offered us a canal view room. It looked clean, tidy and well located on-line.The bathroom smelt awful and was covered in mould. The curtains were stained brown from smoke and the cheap laminate flooring looked like it had not been washed for weeks.Service was poor and on check out they added exhorbitant taxes and then wanted to charge us an extra 鈧?5 to pay by credit card.Avoid it!

<Content>Dont stay here Dont stay here. This hotel is terrible. They would bang on my door at 8:45 am to clean my room and if we were not awake, no service, towels, etc. At the breakfast, a staff member pulled a plate from in front of a guest who was trying to get a piece of bread at exactly 9 am because breakfast was over at 9am. He literally took it from in front of the guest. Then he stared at everyone until they finished eating. Terrible.

<Content>Dont stay in the 4 bed dungeon Huge stairs, 3 of us staying in 4 bed room, cramped and pretty uncomfortable. There was a metal grate on the window - below street level, everyone can see in, we called it 'the dungeon'. Cute guys working on front desk most of time - only bonus. Wasnt as cheap as i thought it was going to be. My advice, splash out and go for the Americano Hotel next door!

<Content>No mas, Maas! I booked this room 6 weeks in advance and requested a room with a canal view. This was not the first hotel that I had contacted; not many hotels in Amsterdam will let you book a single night, oddly. Our room was an interior room, and the man at the desk said the rooms with views were booked. I told him that was too bad! We could literally touch all 4 walls from the bed, and the walls were very thin. The bathroom was the width of the toilet, and no more. We are thin people and had to maneuver around the curve of the sink bowl in order to sit on the toilet. Bending over the sink caused my rear end to hang out of the bathroom. It was very small. The good part is that the room was clean and was located close to the museums, and was on a quiet street with a canal. And the staff was very polite. I paid about $250 USD, though. A week later I stayed at the Victoria, right across from Centraal Station and paid only about $200 USD for a VERY nice hotel!

<Content>Beware!!!! Don't trust your booking confirmation I booked the canal view room with waterbed and jacuzzi as a surprise 40th birthday present for my husband. After receiving the booking confirmation from Bookings, I e-mailed the hotel direct to advise them that I had specifically made this booking for these features, particularly the waterbed as I wanted to make his 40th special.Three days later (and only 3 days before we were due to arrive), I had still not received any confirmation from the hotel so I e-mailed them again then rang them direct (from the UK), only to be told that no such room was available as 'no booking had been received'. I advised them that I had the booking confirmation in front of me, and asked why they had not contacted me 3 days earlier on receipt of my original e-mail, and what would have happened had we just arrived? They merely said that they 'would have found us something, HOPEFULLY'!After contacting Bookings, they were extremely annoyed with the hotel as they had STILL not received notice that the rooms they were still advertising were unavailable. The hotel then rang me back and offered a room at the rear of the hotel (NO canal view), NO water bed and NO jacuzzi although we could have a free breakfast,as though this was some sort of compensation! Needless to say, I immediately cancelled and frantically made alternative arrangements.SO BEWARE!!! Do not assume that a confirmation booking will actually get you a room at all, let alone the one you've booked!

<Content>Great location and loads of attractions nearby!! Our stay at the hotel proved to be worthwhile and I would definetly reccomend returning in the near future. The hotel itself is in a prime location with lots of bars, coffee shops and restaurants with bags of entertainment to enjoy!  The hotel is in a central part of the city which you would expect to have alot of noise, however no noise could be heard from our room at all. The rooms were of a reasonable size, complete with comfortable beds and a decent sized wardrobe and drawers. The bathroom was exceptionally clean and modern with a sink, toilet and power shower with an inbuilt radio! There were however the downsides to the hotel in the fact that there was no safe( which was stated in the summary of room) and the mini fridge didn't work. Also if you want breakfast you have to either pay extra on top of the price for your room or eat out. The hotel also charges you 10 euros tax on top of your room cost (which isn't stated in the summary). The hotel has very, very steep stairs leading upto the reception area from the main road and isn't ideal for older people, (there is however, a lift upto hotel rooms)  We went to see a local comedy show around the corner from the hotel in the square called 'Boom Chicago', which is based on American humor and improvised sketches which involves the audience throughout the show;a must see! The hotel itself stands on one of the many canals overlooking the canal bike hire, which again is another worthwhile activity to partake in. Other fun and exciting activities to do nearby are: Vondelpark (a short walk from the hotel), Heineken Experience, Flower market and the candlelit canal boat cruise.

<Content>Avoid it ! I stayed at Hotel Maas during the long August 15 week-end. Despite all very attractive comments posted on the Hotel website, my wife and I were very disappointed. We'd chosen a double room with canal view. The cleaning of the room and the bathroom was very poor, plus lots of broken furnitures in the bath room. The room was very noisy and we had the impression to sleep with our neighbours....Very liitle room for the price.I don't recommend this hotel but rather the American Hotel just next door.

<Content>HEM Hotel Maas - great location but... I spent three nights in the HEM Hotel Maas in early April with my family (including one teen and one pre-teen) so we had a room for four. The hotel is in a great location, close to museums, canal boat rides, and the Leidseplein district, with hundreds of restaurants and lots of activity and colour. The hotel has very steep stairs up to reception and then more steep stairs either up or down to the rooms (there is a lift). Ok for kids but not too good if the knees are a bit creaky. We were given a room with four single beds, all of which were very narrow and not very comfortable. The room really isn't big enough for so many people, though we did have a window to the outside world (no view just a brick wall but at least there was daylight). At over 鈧?00 for the three nights, the hotel was expensive for such a basic room, then there was a community tax of 鈧?1 per night (not mentioned in the booking) and if you drive a car you will need to pay 鈧?7 per day to use a parking station nearby. The bathroom was clean and modern. The staff were very firendly and helpful. If the room was more like 鈧?35 per night for four people, it would be pretty good value, given its location.

<Content>Clean, Central and Reasonable The reviews here seem to be very mixed but my personal experience of the Maas was very good.There were three of us sharing and when we reached our room, we all thought that it was a bit cramped. However it was also very clean. The next morning we all agreed that we had all slept very well; the beds are very comfortable!The bathroom was spotless and the shower was really strong - great for that really clean feeling. The Hotel Maas is located near Leidseplein. This is a lively area full of bars and restaurants and a great place to sit and watch the world go by.We were a short walk to the Museumplein with the Van Gogh and Rembrandt museums. In the other direction we were very close to Kalverstraat, one of the main shopping areas. Also we were close to Rembrandtplein etc.Some of my friends were staying at the top of Damrak and while they were close to some areas, they were fairly distant from the museums.The staff were very helpful and organised a taxi for us to the airport on our last day.Overall I would recommend the Maas if you are looking for a reasonable central place to stay in Amsterdam. If you are looking for luxury or a very romantic setting then i think this is not the place for you.

<Content>Good location, but would choose a different hotel next time Hotel Maas is right by the Leidesplein, next door to the Crowne Plaza Hotel American i.e. terrific location right by huge choice of restaurants, bars, shopping, museums etc. And the canal bus stops right outside, with tram stops just around the corner. Location really is THE best thing about this hotel, so it is surprising that the hotel literature does not mention this. Near vertical steps lead from the street to reception, but there is a lift to the other floors once you have managed to get up them. Make sure you get a canal view room - some of the others don't even have windows at all. We got an upgraded room for the first two nights of our 3 night stay as our choice was not available (we booked a canal view room with waterbed). The room was on the top floor, and was OK, shame the jacuzzi (the upgraded bit!) did not work though. When we moved for the last night we were expected to move ourselves(!), and the room we got was clean enough but very small. And it reeked of the previous occupants smoke so we were grateful for that window.......and no water bed either, but the bed supplied was comfortable enough. The 3 night stay cost 405 euros, and whilst the hotel was OK, next time for a comparative cost of 504 euros plus 5% city tax I would definitely consider the American hotel next door.

<Content>Great Place To Stay When in Amsterdan stay at The Hotel Mass. A great room, beds a bit small, but clean. Clean bathroom, rooms for groups of 3. Close to everything, great rates, good staff, very safe hotel. Try not to be on the top floor with a shared bath. But ENJOY, you will be back!!!

<Content>One hotel I am not going back to A year ago I booked this hotel. I booked it well in advance for a 3 nights' stay because of its location at Leidseplein and convenience of travelling to my meetings. In fact I've pre-paid the whole cost about 10 days in advance. The room price was around 鈧?0 / night.When i walked into my room, i was sure there had been some mistake and the room was a storage - it was the size of an elevator and it had no windows whatsoever! Not even enough place to put a suitcase. So i went down to talk to the clerk. I was told that they had an overbooking and this was the only thing they could offer me. Not only that but they actually wanted to charge the same price for it. Following a very lengthy debate I was given a regular room (aparently available) but for 1 night only. Even though i have pre-paid the whole cost - they would move me out of the room! Nobody so far was able to explain the logic of this to me.Well, they did offer me to book me into their other hotel - but that one was somewehere across the city, and i was loosing all the advantages of the location. My request of helping me to find a room at any of the nearby hotels received a shrug and no help at all. The only thing i managed to get was a reimbursement of the 2 other pre-paid nights.I walked around the district for a hour early the next morning and found a tiny, simple but very friendly hotel nearby.Not surprisingly, Maas is certainly one place i am not returning to.

<Content>Stay away! After being treated rudely at the desk we took the rickety elevator DOWN to our dungeon room for four. The stench of the 'non-smoking' room we requested was horrendous and we later learned that a majority of it was from the apparently hydrophobic cleaning man that roamed the halls like quasimodo. Upon entering the room we were told by another cleaning person that the room was not ready yet. We found 'quasimodo' sitting on a stack of towels in the cleaning closet smoking a cigarette. This was at 5:30pm! Upon conversation with the desk we were told to consult management the following morning and that the room would be ready shortly. When asked why we got the worst room in the hotel the response was because we had paid little because we booked through expedia. Needless to say, the rest of the hotel experience only got worse. We stayed only one night and promptly left the hotel the following morning. Stay away from this poorly run hotel if you can.

<Content>Hotel Maas ? Please stay away ! Hotel Maas was one of the worst hotel experience I had. The room was very small and dirty. We had a room without outdoor window which was so dark that we had to turn on the light day long. The walls are thin like cigarette paper, so you can hear what happend everywhere in the hotel. The breakfast was included in our 100 EUR rate. The dining room was small. The buffet has not a lot of choice and there is nobody to clean the tables. The dishes were also dirty. My advice : Please stay away !

<Content>Hotel Maas-a wonderful experience We rented out 10 rooms for my daughter's wedding in May 2003. I wasn't sure what we were getting, but was very pleasantly surprised with Hotel Maas. The staff was unbelievably helpful with all of our requests...from arranging for her wedding dress to be steamed to shuffling our rooms around as people arrived!! They definitely went above and beyond the call of duty. The hotel location turned out to be perfect. The museums are right at your fingertips and the Damrack (and shopping) is an easy walk. (Everyone's first order of sightseeing was the Heineken Museum just down the street!!) The rooms are smaller but clean and ample. Those with the canal view (160 euros) have a very pretty view. The breakfast area was nice with a decent selection of food items. Night life was in full swing right next door at the American Hotel. All in all a good find. Any problems that might surface would be handled well with the professional staff. I have to add it was a treat to stay in an authentic Amsterdam canal house rather than the big American hotel. Why stay in one of those when you can experience a bit of authentic Europe??

<Content>A hidden treasure A wonderful find! Typical steep Dutch steps to the lobby but worth the hike to a delightful stay. Superior staff, extremely accomodating to tourist requests. Hotel is not full of Americans but many thrifty (not stingy) Europeans. Small but bright rooms. Small converted bathrooms, most with shower but some with tubs, some even with Jaccuzzi. Less than $100/night. Ample Dutch breakfast included. Outstanding location on Leidesekade at Leidseplein, around the corner from the overpriced American Hotel. Really good transportation hub for taxis and trams. KLM shuttle drop is across the canal. Convenient walking for the Reiksmuseum, Van Gogh, Stedelijk, Concertbegouw, Boom Chicago, Anne Frank, Rembrandt Huis, Flower Market (and the hotel will provide a vase for your purchase), shopping on the Kalverstraat or P.C.Hooftstraat, everything. Excellent restaurants in the neighborhood. Casino a block away. Very busy area but not nearly as noisy as the Rembrand!tsplein.Would I stay there again? Absolutely!!
