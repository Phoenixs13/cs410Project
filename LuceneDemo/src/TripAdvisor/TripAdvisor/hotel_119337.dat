<Content>Nasty place Awful hotel, whose sole design is to make use of the fact that people looking for the Super 8 on the same road will turn in at this same-styled Super 7 sign. The 7 is kept in subdued lighting, you have to look closely. And if your reservation is with Super8, they won't tell you they can't find your reservation.And it is awful. Toilet seats loose, lighting dim, furniture and sink in poor shape, front door chipped, with a newer lock installed over a nonworking older one. Low on toilet paper with no replacement roll.The TV worked and the bed was OK thank God, and the AC wasn't too loud. Otherwise a dreaful place, a few flights down from the quality of a Super 8.
