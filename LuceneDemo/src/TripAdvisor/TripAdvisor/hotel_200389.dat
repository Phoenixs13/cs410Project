<Content>just outside the train statioin. I was in Berlin for the first time. I stayed in the hotel for two nights. It was just outside the underground station, so it was not a problem when I arrived late night.

<Content>Location not a drawback. Would recommend the hotel to anyone who is wanting decent enough standard of accommodation without having to pay city centre prices.As with the rest of Germany , public transport is peerless and having had some trepidation about arriving at Schonefeld and having to get across to other side of Berlin, I made the journey in under 1 hour. From the hotel to Zoo is under 20 minutes with one change and it lies on the U Bahn line a few stops short of Spandau which is a seperate town completely.All in all I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>An Exceptional Hotel This hotel is excellent. I have stayed in this hotel several times and have always been happy to return. It's clean, the rooms are comfortable (don't underestimate the benefits of decent, black curtains that really stop you being woken up at sunrise - sadly lacking from most hotels).The breakfasts are good, and without exception, all the staff are wonderfully friendly and helpful.The location is well out of town, but is literally next door to a U-Bahn station, so that doesn't matter too much. Allow 20-30 mins to get into the centre, depending on where you're aiming for.I thoroughly recommend this hotel, primarily for business travel but I could also see it having some tourist potential.
