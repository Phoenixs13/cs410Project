<Content>excellent after upgrade After arriving at the hotel, the first room (superior room for which we have booked) was really dark and awfull. We've got another superior room on the 3rd floor but there was a problem with water in the bathroom which could not be fixed immediately. The all thing was during a lot, we were losing our time. Finally the director proposed us the suite which was marvellous! we've got this suite as an upgrade. All the rest of the hotel is excellent; breakfast, furniture, service, staff (even they did not spoke english), dinnerwe recommend not to choose the superior room or executive room because it is not worth it. Best to do is standard room who are very nice.

<Content>Fantastic and classic When I entered I had the opportunity to meet the Director who came to say hello to my wife and myself. He invited us to a cocktail. I actually drunk 2 gin tonics and during that time, he explained us how the hotel works etc. Rooms were refurnished and had nice flat tvs. The service was very friendly and what is more important: Very helpful.Room service was terrorific and the restaurant is closed to have one star michelin. Amazing!!!!!!! Now I understand why spanish food is at the level of french cuisine or even better.

<Content>Charm could go modern I booked the hotel directly but the reservation had disappeared...Fortunately they had rooms,actually very nice and gave us an upgrade because of the inconvenience.As others have pointed out THERE IS NO COMPUTER ,NO PERSONAL COMPUTER TO LEND though they state this as one of their facilities.Breakfast isn't worth the 30e they charge,but is in a charming space.The decoration is wonderful so ,if you're after charm it is perfect.

<Content>Great small hotel with personal service I stayed here for 9 nights in late July while I was in Madrid for business. It's a deluxe, small hotel with very good, personalized service. The room was very comfortable and the bath included a tub with jacuzzi. Very nice for relaxing after a long day of work. The bed and linens were very, ver ynice. I also appreciated the blackout curtains and small sitting area. The hotel staff left a bottle of sherry twice during my stay - a very nice touch. I did not eat in the restaurant, but did have some room service, which was quite nice. There is a small bar which is really just a waiting area for the restaurant. I was able to have a beer and read the paper outside in the restaurant before they started seating people at 9. The front desk staff are fantastic. They were quick with suggestions, very helpful at every opportunity and always made me feel welcome. The service was one of the best parts of my stay and is the main reason I would go back. I liked that it was on a quiet side street in a residential area. This was part of the reason I chose to stay here. I was a 10 minute subway ride from where I was working. I was willing to give up a fantastic view for quiet. It's in a wealthy neighborhood with lots of embassies. It felt very, very safe. I walked to Chueca (and good food) in 10 minutes. The hotel does have a few drawbacks. There was no desk in my room , which meant I had to put my laptop on the dresser. They haven't quite worked out how to provide internet services either. They should just give away wifi rather than wasting so much time (mine and their staff's) trying to sell it. Other than these glitches, the hotel was very good. I give it a solid 4 stars. To get 5, they would have to improve their rooms and facilities (access to a gym would be a help). I would definitely stay here if when I go back to Madrid.

<Content>Off the beaten path Beautiful hotel in historic building. Nice sized room that was clean and well equipped. Front desk was very friendly and tried to be helpful however it seemed as if they are more used to business travellers than tourists as they weren't that well versed on basic tourist attractions and/or hot new restaurants, etc. If you know where you want to go and what you want to do, then this wouldn't be an issue. No true concierge per se. Hotel is in a quiet residential area that is only a 5 -10 minute walk to an area filled with restaurants, shopping and tourist attractions, however it is somewhat off the beaten track. Great breakfast (although pricey), friendly and clean in general. Extremely charming appeal. Overall a good hotel despite the above critiques. I'd probably try someplace else next time but would stay here again if nothing else seemed appealing.

<Content>Perfect for a romantic weekend! Fantastic small hotel! We stayed 5 nights for an anniversary weekend and it couldn't have been better!! Location is perfect, tucked down a quiet side street, so it really an oasis of peace in a noisy, hectic city where people don't even start going out to dinner before 9pm. Off a side street from Plaza Colon, at first our taxi driver had trouble finding it - always a good sign. Rooms are large, tastefully decorated and well appointed, particularly those at the back, and we found the staff extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Madrid seems to be filling up with ultrahip design hotels which have no character and charge you a whack - the Orfila is not cheap, but great. There's a subway two blocks away, but as Madrid is really a city to walk and enjoy, we walked everywhere - the Prado and museums are only a 15-20 minute walk away. There is no shortage of excellent tapas bars and restaurants in the Chueca area which is no more than 10 minutes's walk. It's always a risk booking online, but in this case it was (for us anyhow) a risk well-rewarded. Can thoroughly recommend it for a romantic weekend in one of the most fun cities in Europe!

<Content>Nice and quiet, and somewhat upscale Hotel Orfila is a small, upscale establishment on a quiet side street near the Plaza Colon. It is the only Relais  Chateaux property in Madrid, but it is not nearly as nice as many of the others in this group where we have stayed. The lobby, restaurant, tea room, and outside terrace on the main floor look lovely, but once you are upstairs, the hallways and bedrooms are in need of fresh paint, clean wallpaper and new carpet. The level of service is surprisingly ordinary, and if you want a drink at the small bar you have to ask at the front desk for someone to fetch it for you. We did not have dinner at the restaurant because the menu was not particularly appealing and it never changed the four nights we stayed at the hotel. Breakfast was satisfactory, though one server was not enough to adequately handle all of the tables, and lunch had to be specially ordered either in your bedroom or in the tea room from a modest selection of choices.Hotel Orfila may not be up to the standards of other Relais and Chateaux properties, but in its own, somewhat upscale way it provides a quiet respite from the hustle and bustle of Madrid.

<Content>Classic, comfortable, friendly Stayed here in summer 2005 - horrifically high temperatures, and the hotel was a welcome refuge to come back to. Traditionally furnished but very comfortable. Staff very friendly and very helpful - even when we arrived for check-in hours before normal time. Really good breakfast buffet. Just down the road from the AC Mauro, where the staff (presumably used to Posh and Becks and not interested in lesser beings) couldn't have been more UNfriendly if they'd tried! There are trendier hotels, and more central (as in, close to the museums) hotels, but this is a good one, very friendly, and only a few minutes from the shops of the Salamanca district, or the round-town tour buses. Would stay again.

<Content>Perfect stay at Orfila We spent five perfect nights at Hotel Orfila in Madrid. Staff is very friendly, English-speaking, and wonderfully accomodating. Clientelle seemed mostly European, very upscale and sophisticated.This small, traditionally furnished hotel is beautifully restored and rooms are very plushly decorated, with large bathrooms and very comfortable living space. Good breakfast buffet and also several cafes nearby. Location is one of the best assets, near Plaza de Colon in a very upscale neighborhood. The subway stop is about three blocks away, or you can take a 15-minute walk down the stunning Paseo de Recoletos to the main street, Gran Via. Nearby neighborhoods in walking distance are Salamanca (Madrid's best neighborhood, lots of shopping and restaurants) and Chueca for late-night dining and barhopping. There are many cafes and bars within walking distance, as well as taxi stands three blocks away on Calle Genova. You definitely get more than you pay for at this great hotel!

<Content>A pleasure I just returned from a great trip to Madrid, Spain. During my time there I stayed at the Hotel Orfila. I was very impressed with the level of service and the ambiance of the hotel. It was pretty, very clean and located on a nice, quiet street within walking distance of key venues and attractions. The hotel staff was lovely and very accomodating. They went out of their way to make my stay a very enjoyable one. They were helpful, friendly and very professional. I highly recommend this hotel! It was a real pleasure!

<Content>Top hotel in Madrid I stayed twice at this excellent hotel, ideally located in the center of Madrid.The main characteristic of this hotel is discretion: located on a quite street, it is an old building exquisitely adapted for the hotel, with none of the bragadoccio associated with the main chains. The service is superb, the rooms are large and quiet (most of them with no views), and it has a small restaurant with patio.The only drawback is price: it is an expensive hotel. But if you are looking for a quiet, low-key luxurious hotel, this is the place.
