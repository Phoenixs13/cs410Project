<Content>Do Not Stay Here There is now way this hotel is 4 stars. I would maybe give it 1 star. There were stains outside of the elevator. When I went into my room there was an awful smell. There was mold in the bathroom. I laid down on my Single bed and could feel the springs in my back. I highly recommend the Marriott in Hoopdorf instead of this place.
