<Content>Perfect Hotel For Everything I found this hotel on TripAdvisor and booked directly with the hotel. There was 13 of us staying in Berlin for 2 nights and this place was just right. The rooms were big, clean and fully equipt and the staff were very helpful in everyway. As for the breakfast - well the reputation is true....first class options and quality. The location was brilliant too - far enough from the centre of Berlin to not be busy and expensive, but close enough to walk in Mitte if you like. There are U  S-Bahn stations very close and also there is a 24hr bar only a few steps away. Also the area has many other bars and restaurants. Really, whatever you are lookng for in a hotel - this works for everyone! Just book it!

<Content>ann ireland 15th. june 2008 just returned from four day trip to Berlin. This hotel was ideal, really close to u bahn and handy for buses too., They offer the best breakfast you could imagine all sorts of cereals, juices ,and such a choice of fresh fruits also bacon sausage scrambled egg and too !. Sets you up for the day. The rooms are spotlessly clean and of ample size, as are the en suites. The front rooms face onto the busy road and can be noisy during the night .(there are only a few of these) insist on a room towards the back and it will be very peaceful all night.. The staff are helpful in finding some restaurants down nearby streets that you would really miss without help. A bonus is that down most of the side streets about 3/4 kilometre you will arrive at the riverside, which is a lovely walk. I felt it was a quiet safe area even in the evenings and you can actually walk t o the Brandenberg Gate from the Hotel.

<Content>good value Stayed at the hotel in february and booked a room for three people. Hotel was located close to a tube station so travelling around Berlin was made very easy. The room itself was pretty basic - but you get what you pay for. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and helped in everything from advice on where to go and eat/ drink to actually booking resturants for us. The breakfast is large and varied and will see you through till lunch easily. All in all the hotel is a good value, friendly and convieniently located for a visit to Berlin - definatly recommended

<Content>A friendly oasis in the heart of Berlin The Hotel Tiergarten is an unassuming, friendly and very conveniently located family owned hotel. Located in a typical 19th century apartment block, the majority of the rooms face onto a quiet inner courtyard. They are, typically, high ceilinged with an en-suite bathrooms carved out of a corner. There is nothing particularly grand about the rooms but the beds are comfortable, the rooms are reasonably large, and there's plenty of hanging space. Oh, and the prices are sensible.Breakfast is served in two wood - panelled dining rooms. The buffet encompasses everything from hot dishes through to cold beef and smoked salmon - a really amazing spread that will see you through the day.The hotel recommends a few of the local restaurants and, as the neighbourhood evolves (a large German ministry has opened next door), new eateries are opening up all the time. Secure off-street parking is easily arranged in a multi-storey car park a couple of doors away. There's a U-Bahn station close by and a much more useful S-Bahn station a short walk away. If you arrive by air, the airport bus stops outside the hotel.Basically, this hotel is ideal for the seasoned tourist who wants a simple base close to the centre of town.

<Content>Excellent value I booked this hotel directly via the internet and the staff couldn't have been more helpful then or during our stay. The buffet breakfast is excellent and fresh fruit is left on the landings every day. Both rooms were very clean and comfortable with good facilities and very quiet as the design of the hotel means most are away from the main road. Public transport is minutes away and the Reichstag is only 30 minutes on foot along the lovely riverside walk. There are several good restaurants close by too. We paid a little over 拢50 per night which was excellent value, particularly at this time of year. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A gem of a hotel We were a group of 5 couples aged 58+ and chose the Hotel Tiergarten for its character, price and location. It is situated only 2 stops on the U-bahn from the Zoo station with the TXL airport bus stop a short walk away). Our flight landed at 10.05 a.m. Berlin time and we were in our hotel by 11.00 a.m.! Our rooms overlooked the internal courtyard and were very peaceful. We stayed for 4 nights between 16th - 20th April. The owner was extremely helpful and very friendly, as were his staff. There was a great deal of choice for breakfast and the only thing that could have improved our stay was perhaps tea/coffee making facilities in the room although we did have a mini bar. My husband and I had a room on the 2nd floor with ensuite bathroom. It was spotlessly clean and we had a daily maid service. Other members of our group had rooms in different parts of the hotel but they were of the same opinion regarding the high standard. The hotel has a lift and so taking luggage to our rooms was not a problem. It also has a luggage room which meant we were able to leave our cases at the hotel on our last day, until our early evening flight. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for quality at a reasonable price.

<Content>World cup heaven Late post as we actually stayed during the world cup last June.I went with my 12 year old son. We stayed 3 nights at the hotel and had a fantastic time. Previously in Berlin we'd stayed at the Circus Hostel that was fabulous and so we were worried that this place wouldn't be up to our previous experience.However we had a brill time. It's about a 20 minute walk to the Reichstag and very close to the underground. The rooms were spacious and clean (albeit with a bizarre bathroom implant) and the building was full of character. The breakfasts were amazing.Across the street was an Argentine steakhouse that opened late so we ate there after the games - friendly staff.Berlin itself is a great city - will go back again.

<Content>Good value hotel Just returned from 4 days in Berlin at Hotel Tiergarten. (6-9 Dec) Very nice hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Everything was very clean and comfortable and the shower was very good. Our rooms were not very spacious but he manager said if we come again we will get better rooms next time! It was fully booked when we stayed so it can't be helped. Breakfast was a very comprehensive buffet which was very good value as it was included in the room rate and we already had 3 nights for the price of 2. The rooms have a mini bar with reasonably priced drinks if you fancy a nightcap.Would recommend this hotel and if you want a bit of space and comfy chairs in your room ask for one of the bigger ones, but for a couple of days the smaller ones are fine. The staff witll order you a taxi if you want one, which comes in less than 5 mins or they will get out a map and help you find the right train to take!

<Content>Great hotel I and 14 of my friends stayed here the weekend before Xmas 2005 (apologies for the late review!). I organised the accommodation through the Berlin tourist office and checked the reviews on here. All of my friends thought this was a great hotel so there another 14 people backing this review! The hotel was based just down from the underground and was easy to find once you knew what side of the road you were on! The welcome was really nice and they were ready for us all arriving at once. We got to pick our rooms from a list so certain smaller groups could be together. The rooms were a good size with a decent sized bathroom. We had a shower and the shower tray was rather deep so if you have short legs like me be careful! The rooms were warm and cosy as were the beds so no complaints there.The hotel was based beside some good resturants and the pub a couple of doors down on the corner became our local and our meeting point. The highlight of this hotel must be the breakfasts. The buffet was like nothing I had ever seen before. Acres of food, everything you could imagine - fruit, meat, cheese, sweets, bread, rolls, cornflakes, fish, fruit salads piled up on different levels. It looked like a church harvest display. If you stocked up at breakfast you didn't need to eat until the evening.The staff were really nice and coped admirably with so many of us bumbling about and asking questions all the time.I would recommend this hotel to anyone (except those looking for 4 star luxury) and I would definitely go back!

<Content>Not as wonderful as suggested I just returned from a July 2006 trip to Germany, Poland and London. I moved around a lot and stayed at a lot of hotels. The Hotel Tiergarten was my first stop. This is NOT as wonderful as other reviews state. Parking (I had a rental car) is nearly impossible. The tiny lobby has nothing (it DOES have internet access, though) to offer and the elevator is your usual tiny luggage elevator that takes you to a very ordinary room. Ours was on the streetside, so it was VERY noisy all night since the hotel is on a main drag. And we had to keep the windows open, of course, since there's no AC as far as I can tell at any hotel in Europe. WARNING: I almost killed myself stepping out of the tiny corner shower, which is mounted about a foot off the bath floor with a tiny step out. Miss it, slip and you'll be sprawled on the floor like me, wondering if your trip is ruined by a broken ankle. It wasn't, but it was scary. Breakfasts are decent, but not as good as other hotels on the trip. All in all, a very average hotel.

<Content>Great time Stayed at the Tiergarten with my husband and two children and were well looked after. Hotel staff made us feel very welcome and spoke english which helped. Also very helpful with places to see and how to get there. Hotel room was very spacious and contained everything we needed for our 2 night stay. Also was easy to find and within walking distance from the places of interest. Breakfast buffet was absolutely lovely and kept us full till lunch time. Had a wonderful time in Berlin and at the Tiergarten and would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Excellent and charming small hotel I stayed at this small hotel with my partner and with several colleagues from different European countries with whom I needed to arrange a meeting one weekend in November. I can recommend this hotel very strongly to anyone who wants to stay in an atmospheric and charming small hotel with excellent service. The hotel building is converted from a set of nineteenth century apartments in a commercial and residential area of central Berlin - a very good place to experience the atmosphere of everyday Berlin, away from the tourists. It is not a highly luxurious hotel, but very carefully run and convenient, with attention to every detail. Breakfast is generous and excellent. We wanted to hold a small meeting at the hotel, and the manager and staff could not have been more helpful and obliging. While several other Berlin hotels I contacted wanted to charge us at high rates for just using a meeting routine for 6 people (we needed no other facilities), the Tiergarten staff were very happy to make their breakfast room available for our meeting for most of the day free of charge, and were very flexible about supplying us with coffee at minimal charge whenever we wanted it. The Tiergarten is now definitely my hotel of choice in Berlin!

<Content>Excellent transport connections away from tourist bustle. Stayed here a week, accompanying school group but would recommend it highly for families and individuals too. Large triples and quads make ideal for families. My single was a fair size with excellent lighting (a reading lamp at last!) and new bathroom. Incredible breakfast buffet with widest choice I've ever seen in 3 (or 4)star hotel. Staff are pleasant and helpful,with tips on transport, sights (and info on emergency room at hospital!) S-Bahn station Bellevue was nearby (pleasant walk by river then over the bridge) and we used it more than U-Bahn Turmstrasse which is right by the hotel. With S-Bahn you get to see the city and we found Friedrchstrasse a much less confusing station to connect at than Zoo. Both these stations 2 stops away. Short journeys (up to 3 stops) cost less: Kurzstreckenkarte. If you're doing more travelling the day ticket at 5.60 is better value (Kids up to 14 pay less). Even better value for group, Kleingruppenkarte at 14 euros covers 5 people for a day. Reception sells tickets and has maps of U  S-Bahn network, which you'll find essential!

<Content>A wonderful hotel I found the hotel Tiergarten to be a wonderful hotel.The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. It was my first visit to Berlin and had no idea how to get around but was given maps of the bus stations and underground and was told in detail how to use the transport service.The hotel was close to the underground ( less than a 5 min walk) and the service is fast and efficent.The breakfast buffet was lovely and had so much choice.Even for me as a fussy eater!!When I go back to Berlin I will definatley be staying at the Tiergarten.

<Content>Great Hotel, great City This was the second time for me at this hotel, It is close to public transport (which is super efficient in Berlin) Staff are helpful  friendly, this is not a chain hotel, and there is an interest in the guests. Excellent B'fast buffet.Help with looking after luggage prior to departure. Staff also spoke English but then who doesn't in Germany? Rooms are well appointed, no tea making facilities was the only criticism I found.
