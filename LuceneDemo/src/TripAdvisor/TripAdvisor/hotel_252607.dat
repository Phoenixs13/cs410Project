<Content>Good location, right at the heart of Mexico City 10 min walk to Palacio de bella artes, 15 min to Touristo bus, 10 min to Zocalo, and 15 min to St Juan market. Room clean and size is good enough. The perimeter around the hotel is not the best, but ones you are inside the hotel every thing change. Staff is very friendly. Reception was very helpful when it came to requests.I would definitely recommend staying here.

<Content>Bearable but glad to leave The hotel lobby has been updated to have more of a modern feel but past that the property is in need of a makeover. Rooms are quite small and a little on the musty side, the shower pressure is very poor and soundproofing is non-existent. We were kept awake all night due to our 鈥榥eighbours鈥?snoring and the next guests that moved in knew we were from Australia because they could hear us on a telephone call. There are no fridges in the rooms which makes it hard to keep any food. There is also no air-conditioning, which wasn鈥檛 a problem for us as we were there in winter but I would imaging the rooms would get hot during summer.There is a Metro station about 3 blocks away from the hotel but as first timers to Mexico City we didn鈥檛 find the location was all that suitable to tourists, the hotel is situated on a street of electrical shops 鈥?if you need a remote control, a TV or a memory card you are set, however, if you are after food, a laundry or anything else you will have to venture further. We arrived late afternoon and didn鈥檛 feel safe to go exploring in the dark so we had dinner in the hotel, the food is below average and slow to arrive but the restaurant staff are real characters. Once we were more familiar with the area we explored a little further and found some decent restaurants and shops, having said that ,we tried to be off the streets and back in the hotel by 9pm. I believe Zona Rosa is a better option if you want to feel more at ease.Some reception staff were helpful, others didn鈥檛 want to know you or tell you anything. For example, we learn鈥檛 on our last day that if you put down a refundable deposit they gave you a remote control to enable the cable service on the television 鈥?which means you receive English speaking channels. They have 3 computers with very reasonably priced internet access available for guests, there was a number of times we wanted to use them and they weren鈥檛 working, but the problems were normally rectified in under an hour.This hotel is reasonably priced and comfortable enough for a one night stay, for a longer period I would recommend looking elsewhere.

<Content>good hotel and good deal I come to this hotel almost every year from 2004 after reading the first review in TripAdvisor.Here is mine.I like very much this city and think this hotel is ideal to enjoy it.All sights in the Centro Historico are a pleasant walk away,the El Salvador street are vey busy by day but a little intimidating by night,like all the old part of the city,not very well lighted,but I never felt unsafe,and I go out and return to the hotel late and sometimes very late.The Salto de Agua metro station are four blocks away and this line takes you to the zona rosa directly and also to Tapo bus station.There is also nearer the San Juan de Letran metro st. but that line is not very useful and you must to transfer in Salto de Agua to go to other parts of the city.Taxi is easy because the hotel is 50 meters of the Eje Central a very busy avenue.If you prefer,the hotel calls you a safer taxi.Inside the hotel,is all quietness,is a modern buiding,well maintained ,with five floors and a lift.The rooms are very clean,carpeted,cable TV,good mattresses and big windows open to several courts.The bathrooms are good too,simple but with enough light and hot water.Desk people are very friendly,I can say it,there are three internet terminals,but not cheap.And a restaurant that looks uninspiring,but I never use it,can麓t talk about it,but there are endless options outside,althought by night many restaurants close earlyWell,and the better thing is the price,look into their website.

<Content>Convinient and clean We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour, so I can't comment on prices. However, this hotel was clean, comfortable and convenient for the Zocalo and subway stations.There's a lift, Internet access, and the room was dark and quiet - ideal following a hectic day in the city.The area felt safe, and there was a 24 hour convenience store a block away which was handy.Certainly, if I returned to Mexico City I would have no problem with staying here again - it was cheap and cheerful!

<Content>A great  A steal--I think--for 25 USD (one person). More than comfortable room. Friendly, helpful staff--ask for a map of subway system (gave me one free) which also has lots of info. about country. 3 blocks from Salto del Angel or Bellas Artes subway stops (though these stops are confusing when trying to navigate inside). Loved hotel  will choose again without a doubt! Check out their website.
