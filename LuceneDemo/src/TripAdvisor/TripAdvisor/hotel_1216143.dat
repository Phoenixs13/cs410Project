<Content>Double One Villas We wanted to stay in Double One for six days, but we have enough of Amed and decided to chek out on 4th day. Stuff is ok at first sight. We stayed in Ocean View Villa which has deformated hard beds and a toilet with leak. To many garbage on a beach at front of hotel. When we moved to hotel in Kuta, I was phoned by stuff from Double One, they said that I payed them only for 3 nights, but that was lie, I payed them for 4 nights. They did not believe my words and asked for a payed bill, but I left my bill on reception in Double One.
