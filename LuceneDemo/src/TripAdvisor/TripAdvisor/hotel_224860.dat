<Content>Surly staff Staff was very unfriendly and unhelpful. The airport shuttle was especially unreliable. Upon check-in we were told that we had to reserve a shuttle, although it only left every half hour. Upon arriving at the front desk the next morning for our 7am shuttle, we discovered that despite our reservation, the shuttle had already filled up with other guests and left at 6:55, so we would have to wait for the next shuttle at 7:30. As other reviewers have mentioned, the wireless internet doesn't really work unless you are in a room near the office.Unlike other reviewers, we found our rooms to be about average quality and cleanliness for a Travelodge.

<Content>awful We had to stay at a hotel for the night in order to get a flight early the next day and thought that generally the travelodge was a safe option.We were very wrong! The young lady working the front desk was absolutely terrible,she couldn't have cared less.The room wasn't too bad and was clean, but the location is a little scary.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone

<Content>A nightmare of a place There were 2 reasons why I picked this hotel. 1 was that it included breakfast and 2 that there was a free shuttle to the airport.On arriving to the hotel late afternoon (as we were flying home the next morning) and paying for the room, I noticed that I was charged almost $3 extra and when I questioned the fee I was told that it was for the safe. I said I didn't want to use the safe and I was told that if I didn't use it it would be refunded in the morning. I didn't use it and the $3 was not refunded.I was asked what time did I need the shuttle to take us to the airport and was told it ran every half hour 24/7. I said 7am would be great only to be told that there is no 7 am shuttle and it would have to be 6.30 or 7.30. I chose 6.30. Why then tell me that it ran half hourly 24/7?Then was told that we couldn't have breakfast or given antything to eat as it didn't start until 6.30am. If I had known this I would have stayed somewhere else, but I was assured on the phone 3 weeks before that it was fine and they would supply us with breakfast.There wasn't a coffee maker, coffee, sugar etc in our room so I went to reception and asked to please give me one as I wanted to relax with a cup of coffee as we'd had a very long and busy day. The receptionist didn't believe me and looked at me as if I had taken it but said she would send me one. Made several more trips to the reception desk as my phone calls were not answered and each time was told it was on it's way. After more than 3 hours and still no coffee machine when 2 males came to inspect how come there wasn't one. Another hour passed before we finally got one but were given dirty looks.About 10pm discovered that there were only 2 very thin pillows on the bed, so back to the reception to ask if we could have an extra 2. More dirty looks from the receptionist and again had to wait quite some time to get them.The next morning about 6.10am, I went to the reception to use the computer to check on our flights when I overheard a man telling another, that the driver of the shuttle which was supposed to start at 5.30am had not arrived and didn't know if he was coming in at all. He offered the man to drive him to the airport so I asked if we should wait or go with him. He suggested we go with him as we could be stranded with no one to take us.So no breakfast, no shuttle, no coffee machine, rude staff, charged an extra $3 for nothing.......NEVER AGAIN!!!The room was ok, only a double bed but clean enough, the staff however were a nightmare and the area suspect.Wouldn't stay there again even if they paid me.Travelodge should ban these people from using their name.

<Content>Took One Look, Demanded Money Back, Stayed Elsewhere I booked this room via Trip Rewards web site to stay for one night prior to a flight home in the morning. I've stayed in a LOT of Travelodges throughout the country and they have always been adequate so I figured this one was similar. WRONG!!! Just driving into the parking lot, I got a bad feeling about the place. Dirty on the outside, homeless people mulling about in the parking lot, a car full of partiers in the back corner of the parking lot with their music blaring, etc. I checked in and was told that the only way I would be able to get Internet access would be to stay in a room close to the office, even though all other Travelodges I have ever stayed in have wireless access no matter how far you stay from the main office. I decided to at least go check out the room, and as soon as I walked into the room I immediately backed right out of it, walked swiftly to the office, demanded they credit back the charge on my credit card, and drove down the street to Coast Gateway and checked in for the night.The room was FILTHY and to be honest looked like it was the type of place that a prostitute would use on an hourly basis on skid row. It reeked of tobacco even though it was allegedly a nonsmoking room, the curtains were in tatters, the carpet needed to be nuked, the mirrors were filthy, the toilet had someone else's finished product in it and REEKED, and the scary thing was that the folks who were staying in the room next door were out on the walkway by the room drinking beer as if there was no tomorrow....quite drunk and rowdy.This is NO PLACE for ANY traveler to stay in, and I suspect they house welfare recipients. Stay here at your own peril!I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU AVOID THIS MOTEL AT ALL COSTS!!! AND, DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BRING YOUR CHILDREN TO THIS MOTEL!

<Content>Avoid this place like the plague! I stayed here for 3 nights. The photos make it look MUCH nicer than it actually is. It's right near a strip club and in a dangerous part of Seattle (i.e., I would never go out alone at night, being a single woman). I only chose this hotel because 1) it was near the airport and I wasn't renting a car until a few days later, 2) it was economical (you get what you pay for, I suppose!) and 3, I had stayed at Travelodge motels in Europe and there's no comparison to this one. The room was ugly; the bed was okay, but not very comfortable. The walls were so thin that when I entered my room, I heard a man cough and thought I had the wrong room! I actually looked in the closet and the bathroom, expecting to see someone - that's how thin the walls were. The staff members were aloof; the only half-decent one was the shuttle driver! The continental breakfast was a joke. There was NO CREAM with the coffee, and this is Seattle, a coffee mecca!!Don't stay here. Spend a few dollars more -- there are much nicer hotels near the airport. Better yet, stay in Seattle downtown or in one of the Seattle neighborhoods - if you do the research, you'll find good deals (I wish I had!).

<Content>Worst Travelodge experience ever! I have stayed at various Travelodge Hotels for business over the past 30 years. I have never seen a Travelodge Hotel THIS BAD ever! The booking dates turned out to be wrong, when I called to confirm my room, and had to rebook. When we arrived, the desk clerk was arrogant and rude. The hotel room only provided one bed, even though the booking was for 3 adults, and included a roll away cot, there was no cot, and the clerk didn't offer any assistance, his attitude was 'take it or leave it'. The furniture, a chair, was completely broken, the room was dirty, the shower/tub was mildewed in the corners, and the bathroom smelled of mould.This motel is an embarrassment to the Travelodge name, and the Washington State Health Department should be looking very seriously at this facility.

<Content>Limited parking, rude concierge We arrived at the hotel at around 1:30 AM after a long flight from the East Coast and a long wait in the airport, since the airline lost our luggage. For starters, there was no place to park my car. The hotel advertises parking, but it is very limited, and there is not enough space for everybody. The concierge was completely oblivious to my problem. I drove around the area, but there was no parking anywhere. Finally I managed to squeeze my car in some very questionable spot (illegally, of course), risking having it towed or scratched if the neighbors are not careful enough. But it did not end there. Instead of promised two beds our room had only one bad and a shaky roll-away. When I complained to the concierge, he started yelling at me and shouting obscenities. He even cared to follow me to the street and continued to shout as I walked away.Later complaints to the management and requests for refund did not result in anything. Travelodge the network responded, but they said something like we are sorry, but this is an independent facility, we don't control what they do.Stay away from this hotel, especially if you arrive by car and need parking.

<Content>The worst ever experience! A few weeks ago me and my husband stayed at this motel for just a few hours to catch our flight early in the morning. What a horrible few hours they were!First, there was no elevator, so we had to drag our heavy luggage up the metal stairs leading to the second floor. Then, we could not open the door with a key card, and had to go downstairs again to exchange the key at the reception. Upon entering the room it got only worse. The room was extremely non-cozy, and its interior reminded me of some ragged retro motel they always show in crime movies. The light inside the room was harsh and super bright. The washroom sinks were merged together with the room itself, so you could not have any privacy in that sense. The whole room also smelled like smoke, even though we stayed in a supposedly non-smoking one. BUT THE WORST of all was the lights which they have right above a large window in every room!! They were so bright, that we felt like it was a day even with the heavy black curtains draping our window. There is no way even a very tired person can sleep in those conditions!Overall, I had the most unpleasant stay in Travelodge. This place is overdue to be shut down for the its unacceptable conditions. I have no idea how this place even got a permit to be in business. Never again I will even come close to this motel.

<Content>Avoid the second building I have stayed at this hotel in the past and generally found it servicable, but tonight has been a problem. The room which had been set aside for us contained only one bed, and when we indicated that two beds would be needed the indifferent and unfriendly clerk gave us a room in the second building, at the rear of the property. This building, which I have not stayed in before, is much older and more run-down than the main building. Our room has cigarette burns in the chairs and bedcovers; the bathroom has gaps in the tilework; the heater does not work. The occupants of the room upstairs have been pacing back and forth since we returned to the room at midnight -- it is now 02:40 -- and their heavy footsteps shake the ceiling and make the walls creak. It is impossible to sleep with this noise going on, and the front desk has refused to call upstairs and ask them to tread more lightly, so I am taking the opportunity to use the wireless internet, one of the few good features of this room, to write this review. We also had a problem getting picked up at the airport on this trip. The first time we called we were told the van would be around in 15 minutes, but when I called back after 20 minutes there was a different clerk on duty who said there was no driver available. In the end it took a total of 45 minutes -- and a third call -- to get a shuttle. I have not had these problems at this hotel in the past, and it is conveniently located for catching a bus downtown, but on this occasion it has turned into the hotel from Hell and the staff are utterly unconcerned. As there are plenty of other cheap motels in the vicinity of SeaTac airport, I will probably not risk booking a room at this property again.

<Content>Bedbugs! Requested a Non smoking room, they gave us a smoking room, but then said they didn't have any other rooms available. My bed had 2 cigarette burns in the mattresses! There was also Black mold in the bathroom, and the worst part was that in the morning I found a bedbug in my bed with blood in it! I later removed the top mattress and found droppings all over the boxspring! Watch out!

<Content>Not on your life We were going on a cruise, and decided to fly out of Seattle as it was much cheaper than Vancouver. We chose this hotel based on the fact they would allow us to leave our truck there for the 2 weeks without paying extra for parking because we booked 3 rooms both coming and going. Don't make our mistake and pay for parking! Our room the first night seemed not bad, we were tired so hit the bed almost immediately upon arrival. Our 2 kids were asleep, and I was getting our stuff arranged when I took off my shoes and found our carpet was soaked (about a 3 feet circle) around the window. Because it had been raining, we decided that it was probably a leak from the window. The toilet didn't flush either, but again it was late. Upon returning from our cruise and on our way home we checked in and were given the same room (it was 11:30 pm). We went into our room and the first smell was of mold, the carpet was still soaked, and large amounts of mold on the window. My husband went to the office for a new room, and was treated horrible, but was finally given a new room. We thought the new room was ok until we were ready to go to bed when we found that our bathroom was raining from the ceiling, puddles on the floor behind the toilet. When we removed the toilet lid we found that it was actually cut into the wall to fit and not finished around it to stop the leaks, the bathtub was the only dry spot in the room. At which point we started to laugh and decided that we should just get some sleep, as we had a long drive the next day. The noise from the room above us made that nearly impossible, the entire night was pretty much a write off. While packing up the next morning (6:30 am) we were approached by a lady to use our rooms until 11:00am to sleep. Of course we told her no and to go away, she was asking everyone who was getting ready to leave the same. We were shocked that there is no standard that these hotels are required to adhere to. All we wanted was a clean room for the night, so we weren't expecting the Ritz, but believe me this place should be shut down. The other 2 rooms we had for the rest of our group were pretty much the same. One of our group had found pills on the floor and 2 dirty knives in the microwave. So even clean was too much to expect!

<Content>Travelodge was a Nightmare and still is 2 months later... We had the hotel booked and paid for but when we showed up just after midnight, after a long flight across the country with my wife and 2 kids they said that the hotel was full. They had no room for me to stay in. I had to drive over an hour north on the I5 to get another room. Trying to get the money refunded which they charged me was another issue. Travelodge Head Office took almost 2 months to send me a cheque for the overcharge PLUS I had to fax all kinds of proof including proof that I actually had a flight into Seattle that night. I was STEAMED!In over 20 years of travel I have never had a worse hotel experience. I can tolerate noisy airconditiners, less than perfect rooms however......... Stay at a Travelodge and be subjected to that kind of treatment over a 2 month period? NEVER AGAIN, NO WHERE, NO WAY.

<Content>Shirtless homeless man in corridor I stayed here for 1 night and used the shuttle with no problems. The room was clean except the beds boxspring had a gross stain on the side. The bed was comfortable enough but I had to put the stain out of my mind. My room was at the back of the buidling overlooking a warehouse loading dock so traffic noise was nil. I heard a few trucks loading early in the morning though. Breakfast was muffins only. Burger King, McDonalds, small grocery store and a casino nearby but not much else. Rather seedy area overall. A shirtless homeless man was sitting in the corridor as I was leaving in the morning so it seems security is non existent.

<Content>The good thing is it's inexpensive ... You'll probably choose to stay in this part of town to be close to the airport, and that's true: you can get there in less then 10 minutes and they do have an airportshuttle-service. The complementary breakfast is a joke.The motel is a rather shabby and worn down and - because it's rather cheap - only just acceptable. The rooms are clean (or at least smell clean due to the use of cleaningspray), but in desperate need of a renovation, especially the bathroom. The rooms are defenitely NOT soundproof ... but do have an inroom-coffeemaker, no hairdryer. The area itself (International Highway) is not a pleasant area, all though there are a lot of motels here .. Looking for an internetcafe, we walked around a bit around noon, but quickly decided that was not a smart thing to do, so we took our car. When you're staying around International Highway, you'll be very close to the Westfield Shopping Mall.There must be better motels in the area, if you have a chance to check them out ...

<Content>Pretty Bad I was very happy to only be spending one short night here - definitely needed some work and updating. But what really made me mad was the fact that they rent out parking places to people not staying there, so we had a problem parking when we returned from dinner. The back area of the hotel is definitely scarey!

<Content>Not that bad... Stayed for one night in August '04 prior to flying from Seattle back to UK. Chose the Travelodge because it was reasonable ($65/room) and offered a free lift to the airport. Room was clean, comfortable and noise-free, but because it has no restaurant we had to go outside the motel to eat, not a good idea as the area looks decidedly scarey. Anyway we survived the trip to Wendy's restaurant nearby (like McDonalds only better) and caught our flight no problem. The included breakfast did not exist (we have nobody free to go for it). Next time I'll chose a Hotel as the area did not appear safe but no real problems with the Travelodge itself.

<Content>Bad part of Town Went on a trip to East Coast, upon arrival back here in Washington, I decided to stay a local motel. I changed my mind about the Travelodge. Staff was non-existant for 10 minutes, I felt as if I would either get picked up by a prostitute or offered drugs.Stay away if you can. I went and paid $20.00 more for a nice room at the Marriott.
