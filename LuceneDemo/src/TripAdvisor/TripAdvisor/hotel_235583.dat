<Content>Fantastic Location We recently stayed at the Hotel Lourve forum, and found it a great location to easily catch the metro or walk to the Lourve, Notre Dame, and The Siene (an easy 5-10min walk). The room we stayed in was the smallest on our European trip, however it didnt really bother us. The shower however was very small, and I did burn myself trying to turn around. There is a lift to use which will hold 2 adults and 2 suitcases, and no more. The room had Air con and it worked very well. We paid 100 Euro, by contacting the hotel direct via email. We did have breakfast one of the mornings we stayed there it cost 10Euro each and consisted of cereals, boiled eggs, toast cheeses, cold meats, yougurt, pastries, and juice. Overall it was ok, and a good price for being so central.

<Content>You can't find a better bargain in Paris The Hotel Louvre Forum made our stay in Paris so much more enjoyable. I am a college student and recently spent 5 days in paris with my mom. We found the Louvre Forum through great reviews, and were not disappointed at all. The hotel has great rates and is one the largest rooms I've stayed in Europe. The staff was so friendly and always willing to help us with directions, what to do, and where to go. The man who sits at the desk during the day is so nice and knows everything there is to know about the surrounding area. The cafe on the corner was a great spot for breakfast and drinks, and though les halles is a little hard to get around it was a great place to be in the city. You are just minutes away from the Louvre and most of the other sites are within walking distance. If not, the metro is also right by the hotel. Overall, you can't ask for better value and better accommodations right in the heart of Paris. I would recommend this hotel to any and everyone!

<Content>perfect budget hotel This is the first hotel I've stayed at in Paris that was not overpriced or overhyped. It is what it claims to be: a simple, clean, reasonably priced hotel (well, cheap by Parisian standards). The staff is friendly. The location is great. I'll try to stay here again whenever I go back to Paris.

<Content>Great staff! Great location! Great bedding! i was in Paris few times and this time i wanted to see Louvre.Hotel location is PERFECT! So close to Louvre, to metros and to all restaurants and everything! The most i loved was the staff. They helped me so much when i left my cell phone in a taxi, they were calling taxi company to find a driver and ask him to come back and give me back my cell. I got it back! And i so much appreciated their help!Now about room. I usually care the most about two things: bed/ding and bathroom cleaniness. And i've got great bedding and very comfortable bed and bathroom was very clean. But note, room is really tiny in size, i was in a signle room.I think the quality is great and exceeds expectations for 90 euro. i'd definetely go back and recommend it for everyone.Enjoy

<Content>Great location, great little hotel My fiance and I recently stayed at this hotel for 1 nights in October 2008.It is in a great location, right near metro stops, easy walk down to the Louvre, the Seine, Notre Dame, near some great night life, particularly Rue Lombards with its great Jazz clubs.The staff are really friendly and are there 24 hours a day. The room was clean and small but really nice and quaint all the same, with a nice flat screen tv. It is also really quiet at night. There is a mini bar which is pretty reasonably priced if you need it. The bathroom again is small but the shower is lovely, really nice and hot. Overall a great hotel, in a fab location, good value for money in Paris and I would stay here again.

<Content>great little hotel in good location Stayed in this hotel for only one night, but was close to several good metro lines, the louvre, but also on a quiet street.Our room was on the 6th floor which had no lift access which might be a problem for some guests, however the room was perfectly proportioned, with a typical european bath. The bed was very comfortable and everything was very clean.There was even some toiletries in the en suite, which I wasn't expecting for a 2 star establishment. Breakfast was an extra 10 euro and there was a good selection by European standards - yoghurt cheese ham cereal, fresh eggs, bread and pastries. No fresh fruit which was a shame. I would stay here again if coming for a weekend. Staff were helpful, which you don't always find in paris. The eurostar passengers the hotel was located only one stop on the RER from gard du nord.

<Content>Perfect choice. This property has proved to be a perfect choice, due to its location and its good service. Room sizes are what they are, that's Paris, I always demand a twin bedded one in order to obtain more space; anyway there's nothing to complain about the whole service, from reception to cleanliness and even to breakfast, that was quite satisfactory.I recommend this hotel, overall good value for money.

<Content>Loved Hotel Louvre Forum I stayed at the Hotel Louvre Forum with a couple of friends in May this year. It was really well located and had excellent access to all the major sights and the transport system. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as there are so many cafes in Paris! The rooms are a bit small (just like the rest of Europe!) but everything worked well and the staff were really friendly and helpful. I would really recommend this hotel if it is your first time in Paris and you want to be in a great location - if you want more space maybe try the 6 eme which also has great restaurants. Thanks to the hotel's staff and the people I met at the hotel - great experience!

<Content>fabulous location, decent hotel My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel when on a short trip to Paris with friends. we booked two standard rooms and were overall very pleased with the hotel.Pros:- Fabulous location. Absolutely fabulous. I cannot say enough good about this location. It is within walking distance from two metro stops (one of which is an RER to get to the airport), and to most major attractions. it is on the yellow line, which stops at the arc and notre dame and marais and connects easily to the eiffel tower. We were travelling with a couple that preferred to metro a bit more than we normally do and thus really enjoyed this about the location. It is literally two blocks (small ones) to the louvre and the tuilleries.- Fabulous staff. There are maps at the hotel and the staff speaks excellent english and will help you find anything. They are also quite knowledgeable about costs of things and where to buy museum passes, etc. Additionally, my husband and I forgot which terminal we were leaving out of when we left and the girl at the desk happily called the airport to find out for us. very kind.- comfortable bed. Trust me, you want a comfortable bed when you have been sightseeing the entire day.- great hot water. never seems to run out.- cheap coca cola! as an American, we do crave the odd coke. at 2 euros a bottle, this is cheaper than anywhere but a monoprix!- windows that open. this is nice when you want to get a little air circulating! additionally, the hotel is on a relatively quiet side street, so you could sleep with the window open.- very clean hotel.Cons:- I cannot stress to you how small the rooms are. the couple we were with was quite shocked. I think this hotel room was smaller than the three other hotels I have stayed in Paris. That being said, this hotel was also much cheaper at 100 euro per night.- though the hotel was clean, it was definitely worn about the edges. it could do with some new wallpaper, etc. that being said, the bathroom looked relatively new, as did the bedding.- I think this is normal in european rooms, but they do not change your bedding daily. and one day when they did change our bedding, the merely took the sheet off and just left us the duvet!- the shower is TINY. my husband and I are normal sized (even smaller sized by US standards), and we were quite squished in the shower. just not much room to manuever, etc.- the lift barely fit two people with smallish suitcases. but that is normal and not really a complaint. we did the four of us fit in a few times to ride up and down (though it states it only holds three people). quite humourous.- we only had the hotel breakfast one day, and it was quite late when we did (it was the day we slept in and didn't have breakfast until nearly 9am). we noticed that they had run out of most things and did not replenish. fine if you go at 7am, but for 10 euros, I want the boiled eggs and larger yogurt and bread variety even at 9am!for the price and the location, I would stay here again if travelling with people on a budget. I usually prefer the other eme., but we were travelling with a couple who had never visited paris and wanted to stay centrally. it was an excellent hotel overall.

<Content>Great little hotel in a great location We just got back from staying here 4/1-4/5 and I can't tell you how pleased I was with the hotel. The rooms are a decent size for an inner city hotel. If you've ever stayed in NYC you'll be pleasently surprised. We had a double bed and there was adequate room for 2 suitcases and 2 backpacks. The bathrooms were very nicely sized, clean and all in great working order. The location is off a nice quiet side street with several great restaurants and bakeries within an easy walking distnace. It's proximity to the main attractions in Paris was very nice. 5 mins to the Louvre, maybe 15 to Notre Dame and St. Chappelle at a nice easy pace. Breakfast runs you $10 per person and isn't a very big selection. If you want something more substantial go elsewhere but it's a decent continental type meal to start the day. I was worried going here because it's hard to tell just over the internet how a place will be. Once we got there there it quickly won me over.

<Content>Very nice hotel for the price We stayed at the Hotel Louvre Forum for 2 nights. It is an easy walk from Les Halles Metro, on a tiny, quiet street. The rooms are small. We had a double bed room for me and my husband and a room with twin beds for our two teenage daugthers. Their room and bathroom were quite a bit bigger than our room and bath, but both were fine. They were very clean and the beds were more comfortable than average, with pretty nice linens. The lobby and breakfast room are nicely decorated and clean. The breakfast had a lot of variety, not just bread items. The neighborhood is very close to a lot of sights; the Louvre is the main one I can think of! The streets are a bit confusing in this area. We got just a bit lost one night when walking back to the hotel after dinner! It's very convenient to get to and from CDG airport; the RER train leaves from Les Halles and takes you right to the airport (just make sure you take a train going to the airport because the line splits).

<Content>Pretty good hotel experience Good things:.....1. EXELLENT location! Really, there does not exist a better place to stay i Paris in my opinion. Close to Les halles (centrum for all metro in Paris), Louvre, Palais, Latin Quarter, Notre Dame etc etc. We could walk to most of the things we wanted to see the first days. .....2. Nice rooms. And very friendly people in the reception with good tips about everything from nightclubs to restaurants.Not so good things:.....1. Room service. The people that worked with washing rooms etc understood 0 english and made a hell of alot noise while vacumcleaning / whatever they where doing all morning, right outside our door. And they did not fix our room while we were out unless we told them to......2. Extremely small hotel. You kinda got used to it, but the elevator barely took me and my girlfriend (no we're not americans/fat).CONCLUSION:Im satisfied. We were a couple who wanted a romantic week, and we got what we asked for. By the way, the beds make alot noise :\ AND it's a tough job getting two people in the bathtub.I recommend Hotel Louvre Forum! :)

<Content>Unexpected visit Devon UK After a family disaster preventing our grandchildren from meeting us in Disneyland we decided to have a couple of days in Paris. Finding the Hotel Louvre Forum was the best bit of luck we had had all day. Coming up from Chatelet Station we saw the hotel sign and just walked in hoping for a room. The receptionist, Didier, was friendly, helpful and informative. The room on the 2nd floor was fairly spacious with big windows opening onto the main street. It was clean, comfortable and welcoming. A well stocked mini bar and safe was provided. Toiletries and towels were available. Very quiet at night, surprising as the cafes and bars were only a stones throw away. Including an Irish bar, 24hr oyster bar and cafe and a chinese restaraunt. Fantastic location, less than 10 mins walk from Louvre. 5 mins from mainline and metro and Les Halles (Enormous underground shopping precinct).Excellent stay, and at 95e per night great value for city centre hotel. Would recomment highly and will definitely be visiting again next time we are in Paris, under happier circumstances

<Content>Friendly, Clean Hotel Great location few mins walk to the Louvre, extremely clean, the staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English. Room and bathroom were small but this was expected in Paris. The lift was tiny with 2 large suitcases and 2 adults, but atleast it had a lift! Would definately stay here again and would recommend it to others. Price was great also. Everything you could want is very close by.

<Content>Positive experience all-around Hotel Louvre Forum is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for quality and value for their money in the center of Paris. I had a great experience all around, from booking through the website to check out, and recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a centrally-located hotel, cheap-mid price range, and great value. You won't be disappointed as long as you have a reasonable expectation of European hotels (small rooms, paying for location vs. amenities). Thanks to previous TripAdvisor reviewers for advertising this great find!Pros:-Location! Minutes to walk to the Louvre, Hotel de Ville, Quartier Latin, shopping at Rue de Rivoli or Les Halles, metro, and more-Value for price -clean room, helpful staff-decent bed and shower, my two most important features(extremely minor) Cons:-Streets immediately surrounding are somewhat dead at night other than a few 24/7/7 cafes and restaurant/bars - but this is of minimal concern as long as you're willing to walk 10 minutes in any direction-No international news channels on the tv

<Content>A great find in the Heart of Paris On our recent tour of Italy, my wife and I decided to fly in and out of Paris since it was a little cheaper and my wife is an artist, but had yet to see the City of Lights.Finding an affordable hotel was a challenge, but we were so lucky to find the Hotel Louvre Forum, a wonderful, small hotel in the 1st Arrondissment about 5 blocks from the Louvre Museum.The hotel was terrific. The rooms are small, but very affordable, and the front desk help was fantastic, specifically the normal daytime concierge, Didier.The hotel was under some construction during our stay, but it didn't really affect us...it just made the outside look a little less than appealing. However, for the money, I can't recommend this place enough. It was much more than we could have asked for.

<Content>A reasonable hotel Having read the trip advisor reviews and had fantastic experiences in the past when choosing hotels based on these reviews, we decided to stay at the Louvre Forum. It鈥檚 a very reasonable hotel, but my expectations which were based upon the reviews and my past experiences were probably set to high.The location is excellent with The Louvre  Notre Dame within easy walking distance. Also the Chatelet Les Halles RER Station is close (5 min) and makes the transfer from CDG Airport very simple. There is a bus stop very close (1 min) where you can catch a bus (No 67) to Pagelle for a visit to Sacre Couer and the Montmare district. The hotel itself is OK, no more, no less.Clean but a little bit tired in places.Very friendly  helpful staff.Breakfast is OK with a choice of cereal, breads, cold meat, cheese and fruit, but is probably not worth the 9 Euro鈥檚 price, but I like the convenience of breakfasting in the hotel.The room size was fine for us but perhaps could be considered a little small. The shower was very small, but was clean and had hot water, so again no real problem for us.At the end of a days site seeing, I find it useful to catch up with news and stuff on TV. Unfortunately, there was no English TV available. Although not a big issue when visiting such a lovely city, I have to confess that I will in future always check ahead that any hotel that I book is offering some English channels. If the price were right, I would book this hotel again, however I would definitely shop around first as The Louvre Forum just does not have any wow factor. It鈥檚 an OK place to stay and the friendly staff and location will guarantee you a good visit to Paris.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location It was our first time in Paris last March 2007 and we booked this hotel through the internet. The room was quite small but very clean and the location was great! A few minutes walk to the Louvre museum, the Seine and Les Halles. A block away is a small street with very interesting fares - blocks of cheese on take home plates, the best ice cream we've tasted in Paris, roasted whole chicken, fresh fruits and vegetables. Nearby also is the Pied Cochon, a celebrated restaurants in travel books - a real experience. Aside from the great location, Hotel Louvre Forum has very nice staff. Didier is a gem. He gave tips on good restaurants and how to get around the place. The night staff- the sweet old man and the pretty young lady were very nice as well. When we left the hotel in a hurry, we left a pair of brand new men's shoes and they made sure that our friend, who came in later gets it so it will be brought to us. We didn't even know we left it that time. Am definitely recomending this hotel to my friends.

<Content>A great little hotel We stayed at the Louvre Forum for a long weekend in January. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful and the rooms to be clean and nice, although small. However for the price I did not expect a palatial suite. The hotel is well situated, close to bars (I would recommend the one 2 doors away), shops and metros. The Louvre Forum is very good value for money and I would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone who wants a bargain hotel in the heart of Paris.

<Content>not impressed! Great location. small room but clean and practical - apart from having no wardrobe to put our clothes in. Also was quite disappointed as the little furniture we did have was taken one day when we were out. On our rtn we noticed my stuff which was once a dressing table, was put on the bed. The table had gone and we now had x3 lamps on the floor to replace this. When we inquired at reception, she told us that the room had been painted while we were out. I werent over pleased knowing workmen had been in while our belongins were in the room either. They never did replace the table - leaving us with two chairs and three lamps....sorry but for the money I expected more - and this didnt quite cut the mustard!

<Content>brilliant location We have just spent 3 nights in Hotel Louvre Forum. It was very clean and comfortable with friendly staff and excellent value. The lift, though small, is plenty big enough for 2 + luggage. But it really wins out on the location which is within a short walk of the metro and Louvre (5 minutes), Notre Dame (15 mins), Beaubourg (10 minutes). Five minutes walk to Chatelet Les Halles for connection to Charles de Gaulle Airport.

<Content>Great Value Central Location Great location nice smallish room but expected in Paris room had a fridge which was handy. Surrounding area had supermarkets for supplies, great pastry shops for breakfast and small friendly staffed bars for a nice meal. Try lunch times for a meal with the local office workers. A quick stroll to the Louvre paid 88 Euro per night for a double room didnt have the breakfast so great value for 1st District Paris. Staff very friendly and helpful didn't mind storing bags to pick up later.

<Content>not so nice... Well as i read all these positive reactions, i'm not positive at all. The hotel a poor 2 star. But the staff is not friendly at all.You can have better hotels for the same price in the first district.

<Content>Cosy spot.Totally Paris. My daughter and wife had stayed here in 2004 and loved it. When my wife and I decided on two weeks in Paris last May we used it as our base and it was pretty well perfect. Clean, neat and perfectly located. It even smells great. Sure, rooms are small compared to North America but it just adds to the quaintness of the place. We didn't feel like we were visiting Paris, we felt more like we were living there. Even Didier, the desk clerk wasn't a hotel employee to us, he was our neighbor.We are already booked in for two more weeks next May.

<Content>Great Location, just what's required... I stayed in this hotel purely on the basis of the reports on this site, and was not let down. It's in a great location, central for everything and just a nice walk from a good Metro station, and also a good shopping district.The Hotel itself was very well appointed with friendly helpful staff. The room was a little small but the TV, Air Con and Mini Bar made up for that. In reality you don't go to Paris to spend time in the room!!I'd have no difficulty in recommending this hotel to anyone, and would (will) go back in the future. Their online booking system, while not secure was efficient and prompt.

<Content>very good price-quality relation it's not a five star hotels. The room is a bit small (for the american standards)but very clean and practical, as is the bathroom, with air conditioned. The hotel is very well located, just behind the Paris market stock and Louvre Museum. The unique thing that is not worth is the breakfast because very close to the hotel you can find Le Thermidor, a very good restaurant with very nice waitress and very good prices to have lunch, dinner and breakfast. We payed 90 euros per night without breakfast and we stayed on the 5th floor, very quiet room. The morning recepcionist was very friendly. We booked by e-mail sending our previously secured credit card number without any problem, but i would recommend you a telephone call at morning to book in advance. The hotel website booking page is not SSL secure. Don't put your credit card by this way.I really recommend this hotel and we will return of course.

<Content>Small space for small price You can't beat the place for the money. Small, but clean. The showers are extremely small and the towels weren't the softess, but you can't complain given the low rates. Location is also great, close to train station, Louvre, and restaurants.

<Content>Recommendable budget hotel! Me and my wife booked a stay at this hotel after reading many good reviews here at Tripadvisor. We booked online without any problems and the response from the hotel came shortly after booking.After staying at other budget hotels in big european cities we had put our expectations quite low, but that there was no reason for!Our room at the 6th floor (stairs from 5th to 6th floor) was small, but cosy and clean with a nice bathroom.Only negative to say is that the noise from the hallway and elevator machinery was disturbing, but no noise from traffic or the streets were ever heard.We can really recommend this hotel, just bring a pair of earplugs (they can come in handy sometimes).

<Content>Hotel Louvre Forum and Hotel Flor Rivoli comparison My wife and I traveled to Paris in April 2005 for a nine day stay. With the Paris Marathon occurring in the middle of our visit, we were unable to book our first choice hotel for the entire stay. The upside for TripAdvisor readers is this minor inconvenience provided us the opportunity to directly compare two highly rated value priced Paris hotels: Hotel Louvre Forum and Hotel Flor Rivoli.LOCATION. Both hotels are equal distances from the nearby Musee du Louvre and the Chatelet RER station. This is convenient for budget travelers allowing you to take the RER directly from Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport without having to switch trains. While the Hotel Louvre Forum is only 0.4 km from the easy Louvre-Rivoli station (Line 1-yellow), Hotel Flor Rivoli has two access points to the mammoth Chatelet Metro station just steps away. It is also closer to the Ile de la Cite attractions. ROOM AMENITIES. Our room at Hotel Louvre Forum had two single beds for 98 euro/night. The room was small but well laid out, with an open closet/organizer/desk unit, small TV, mini bar frig, and a room safe. The private bathroom was modern, clean, and nicely decorated with a bath with a shower hose unit on a post which allowed for hands free showering, though you needed to bend down to get under the low shower head position (or lift the sprayer off of the post). The hotel is on a quiet side street off of Rue du Louvre, so street noise is non-existent. Our room at Hotel Flor Rivoli had a double bed for 80 euro/night and was a step down in all respects from our room at Hotel Louvre Forum. Again the room was small with an elevated TV with a disfunctional remote control (the batteries taped to the back of the remote probably just needed to be replaced) and a tiny closet containing a room safe. A small desk was inconveniently placed in a high traffic corner of the room and there was no mini bar frig. The private bathroom was modern and clean with a bath and a shower hose unit. However, there was no post for the shower head and there was no partial shower screen as there was at Hotel Louvre Forum. Therefore, showering required a little coordination and usually resulted in an unplanned wash down of the rest of the bathroom (or any unfortunate soul sharing the bathroom at the time). The hotel is located right off the busy Rue de Rivoli and much of the street noise filtered into the front guest room we were staying in.HOTEL STAFF AND AMENITIES. The Hotel Louvre Forum staff was polite and professional while the staff at Hotel Flor Rivoli was warm and friendly. The Hotel Louvre Forum had a nice sized sitting area and an elevator that could hold two Europeans with luggage or one American and luggage. The Hotel Flor Rivoli had a sitting area the size of a restaurant booth and a tiny elevator that could hold two very well acquainted Europeans (you will definitely be well acquainted after the ride) or one American without luggage. We didn鈥檛 get the breakfast at either hotel as there was a Franprix supermarket next to the Hotel Flor Rivoli and another only a short distance from Hotel Louvre Forum. Both hotels also have nearby boulangeries and cafes, and a McDonald鈥檚 on Rue de Rivoli very close to Hotel Flor Rivoli. RECOMMENDATION. While both hotels provide a great value for hotels located in the heart of Paris, I would recommend paying the few extra bucks and walking the few extra steps and staying at Hotel Louvre Forum. The better amenities will result in a more pleasant stay. My wife found both hotels to be equally nice.

<Content>Keep telling yourself how much money you're saving My 12 year old son and I stayed at the Louvre Forum for two days during March 2005. The room was very basic, very small but clean. The bathroom and shower were perhaps the smallest I have ever seen. The location is excellent and the staff helpful but not especially friendly. I would only recommend this hotel for those on a tight budget. I had to keep reminding myself how much money I was saving by staying there.

<Content>Great Location at low price I stayed here March 5-8 2005 at end of business trip to France after reading reviews on Tripadvisor. Dropped by without reservation and was given room at 10:00am! Staff was generally cold, but then I did stop in without reservation. Single room with shower is tiny. Shower was same size as in my 25' sailboat. I did get to see a double with bath on last day and it is reasonable size by US standards. Everything is very clean, location is excellent for walking to Louvre. 5Euro cab fair to Notre Dame, 10Euro to Eifel tower. Several good resteraunts within 3 blocks. Plan to stay again in June with family but definately getting two double with bath roomsLarry St. Pete Beach Flordida

<Content>Confusing reservation I read all the good reviews and based upon location and price decided to book this hotel. I called in the morning and they took the credit card information. They told me to send an email with the reservation request and that they would send me a confirmation . The website did not have a secure server. Later in the day I called to confirm the room type and was told that they did not book anything until 30 days before arrival. THe hotel person repeated this and tried to wisk me off the phone. I tried to ask about the confirmation from the morning and the hotel person responded that they only book 30 days before arrival -without elaboration. I asked to speak to a manager and she said goodbye and ended the conversation. Perhaps the hotel is a good hotel but two things created complications: the surly treatment by the staff and the uncertainty of an actual reservation. I have been to Paris before and the hotels have been helpful and professional.

<Content>Would stay here every time! This place is exactly what my partner and I wanted in a Paris Hotel.  It is in a area we like, close to the Louvre and some wonderful shops and restaurants where you can spend the money you save on the price friendly but very comfortable hotel.  The room and the bathroom were very clean, the room was quiet, the staff very friendly. what more could anyone ask for?? It's not the NY Plaza but if you cared for that you wouldn't be reading Tripadvisor I suppose.

<Content>Decent Hotel In Paris My wife and I stayed here in September of 2004 for a few nights during our European vacation. The hotel was a bit difficult to find even for the taxi drivers. It is a bit tucked away on a side street right off the main street to the louvre. It's not that hard to find and it's quiet. I found the staff to be very nice and friendly. The breakfast buffet was a bit pricey but the food is good and french chef was very nice and inviting. You are about 10 minutes away from the louvre and nearest metro. Not bad if the weather is nice but horrible in the bad sun or snow. There are a few cafes close by with an excellent pizzaria/past place right next door. The room was very clean and neat and had lots of hot water in the shower and an excellent AC. The room was tiny with barely enough room to squeeze in the bed. The shower wasn't much better. But after staying in Europe for a while this seems to be the norm. So overall the price was great if you don't mind a little bit of walking.

<Content>Good Choice - thanks to tripadvisor I stayed here in early October after viewing good reviews by other users on this site. I was glad I stayed here for 2 nights and am thankful to other people who had visited and offered honest reviews - I was warned that it was a little difficult to find as it was tucked away on a side street and whilst it was, initially, a little difficult to locate - it was not as difficult to find as I thought (there is a reasonable map on their website) - but once I found it, it was a small, quite (no noise to disturb one's sleep, although occasionally you could hear noise from other rooms), and well appointed, basic hotel which I felt was excellent value for its price - we were on the top floor in a small room (as I warned to expect in Paris) with a very clean bathroom, TV (with BBC News 24 and Eurosport), a fridge and a locker, only about 10 mins walk from Les Halles metro station which is only about four or five stop on a direct line from the Gard Du Nord - perfect for travellers from England. We were about 5-10 mins walk from The Lourve and with the metro station so close and so many things within walking distance (Pompidou (?spelling) centre also about 10 mins walk) we were really able to enjoy Paris - there are a few cafes / restaurants within walking distance - not a huge selection but enough if you are there for a couple of days - nice neighbourhood and as a women travelling with me Mum we were able to wander (viewing the beautifully lit Eiffel tower at night from the grounds of the Lourve just a shory stroll away) and felt very safe - a good choice all round! Staff were friendly - I did not ask many questions but when I did they were helpful and accommodating.

<Content>Excellent hotel We stayed in the Louvre Forum in April 2004 for our wedding anniversary trip to Paris. It is in a great location - with everything you need close by and all of the sights easy to get to either by walking or on the Metro (which is very easy to navigate!!)The rooms were smallish but very clean and comfortable - they had everything you would need - in room safe, TV, mini bar and quite a bit of storage space. I particularly liked the tall typical Parisien windows. The shower rooms were quite small but adequate and very clean.The staff were helpful and although we tried to speak French they wanted to speak English!I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again - we paid 85 euros per night - why pay more for facilities you won't have time to use?

<Content>Chose this for my son traveling alone I chose this hotel for my 21-year-old son who was traveling in Paris alone after the Athens Olympics. The staff was wonderful to him and to ME! I e-mailed them to make sure of his safe arrival and they graciously e-mailed back to say he had arrived and was resting. A mother's mind was eased because he was in a safe area and close to the major attractions and accessable transportation. He could walk to good restaurants and to must-see places, especially the Louvre. The price was right, he had a private bath, and the facilities were very clean. Location, cleanliness, and personal attention - a good value for anyone.

<Content>a perfect small hotel--great location, reasonable rates, comfortable I stayed four nights at the Louvre Forum in August 2004 and loved it! It is perfectly situated on a quiet street very near the Louvre and Les Halles. I walked everywhere. My room (a single at 75 Euros) was small but very comfortable-- very clean, new bathroom, excellent A/C, and the most comfortable (double) bed of my three weeks in Europe. The staff--especially Didier-- could not have been nicer or more helpful. The breakfast (9 Euros) served downstairs was decent-- coffee, cold cuts, croissants and baguettes, yogurt. I'd go back to this hotel without hesitation. My only issue with recommending it is that it may be full the next time I visit Paris! The rates (75 Euros single/ 95 Euros double) are very reasonable.

<Content>Super Hotel Stayed here 21/08/08 for 2 nights. Fantastic location, easy to reach from Eurostar and CDG. Quiet street, close to a wide range of restaurants and serious, but not expensive, shopping at Les Halles. Male companions bring a book and go drink coffee while females browse and buy. Hotel has smiling staff and a small bar area good for unwinding. A/C in rooms and comfy beds, very good value. I visit Paris regularly and I'll make this my first choice in future. I also stayed at the Hotel Langlois on this trip and while rooms are large and charming the shower temperature was dangerously erratic at times and there are only free standing fans to cool the rooms. The area is not so nice and the staff are very reserved speaking only when absolutely necessary! So for the charm, comfort and price I'd choose Louvre-Forum every time. By the way am I the only person who would like website details with the reviews?

Loved the air conditioning, and the water pressure was fantastic in the shower. The room rates are reasonable for that location and even the prices for the mini-bar in the room were reasonable. Safe available in the room. Loved Paris so we will be back. Where we're staying goes w/out saying. Enjoy!

<Content>Excellent stay at Hotel Louvre Forum I had an excellent two-night stay at Hotel Louvre Forum in July 2004. The hotel was just perfect! At 75 euros/night for a single en suite, it was very reasonably priced. The room was clean, bright, air-conditioned, and had a modern bathroom with shower. The staff at reception were friendly and helpful. I skipped the hotel breakfast (9 euros) in favor of the nearby cafes and street markets.Most importantly, the location is ideal for seeing the sights of Paris. It's walking distance to the Louvre, Tuileries, Musee d'Orsay, Le Marais, and more (depending on how much walking you want to do). It's just a few minutes walk to two Metro stops: Les Halles on the 4 line (toward Montmarte and the train stations at Gare du Nord and Gare de l'est) and Louvre Rivoli on the 1 line (toward Champs-Elysees and L'Arc de Triomphe). There are tons of restaurants and cafes within a few minutes walk, including at Les Halles which is a pedestrian-only street mall with shops and outdoor dining. I highly recommend Louvre Forum and will definitely stay there the next time I visit Paris!

<Content>Great find! We arrived in Paris not knowing what to expect from this little hotel. There were quite a few mixed reviews, so we were pretty skeptical at first. We arrived at a very nicely furnished hotel where the reception staff were very friendly and very helpful in directing us towards the major attractions. Our room was quaint, and very nicely kept. The hotel had a great scent in the air, and the location was convenient to everything. We will definitely stay in this hotel when we visit Paris again! We were very satisfied!
