<Content>Wouldn't recommend While the room itself was ok (with the exception of the splatters of...something...on the wall next to the bed), it was exceptionally noisy, both with freeway traffic right outside the window (and I live in NYC, so I'm used to traffic...but this was excessive) and the walls/floors were paper thin. The person staying above me paced like crazy ALL night (from 10pm until 4:30am when I left) and it sounded like he/she was IN my room stomping. I didn't sleep at all because of it. I would start to drift off and THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP. This was strange, too, because I didn't see another person in the hotel (with the exception of the man at the front desk) the entire time I was there. It's also in what seems to be a fairly sketchy part of town, with strip clubs next door. I feared for the state of my rental car in the parking lot, but luckily, no harm came to it (or me). Overall, it was not at all a pleasant experience, and I would not go back or recommend it to others.

<Content>great stay Well im here at the hotel for the Springsteen concert and i have to say that for the price the hotel is excellent. Large double bed work desk, sofa etc what more could you want...oh and theres a fridge and microwave. Im from the Uk and for a hotel like this back home you would pay in excess of $150 per night......perhaps you americans expect too much??

<Content>Don"t do it The price was right - $79, but it cost us alot more in the long run.And the property is adjacent to the highway - NOISY!!!Our truck was broken into - even though we parked under lights and in front of the rooms. Security cameras in the parking lot are ill positioned and only covered a small portion of the lot.The staff was indifferent - Habib was on duty and really didn't care.The Dallas PD took four hours to provide a telephone report. It would have taken 4 days to get the crime scene team out to take evidence.We could have stayed at a five star hotel for what this experience cost us........

<Content>Just average, nothing fancy We have just returned from the OU/Texas game. The hotel was a little difficult to find. I called the hotel to ask for directions and was greeted by a real person that had problems speaking English. When we finally found the hotel, the desk clerks all had difficulty understanding English. I asked for a rollaway bed and with the language barrier that was quite a struggle. The room was clean and we used the free internet on the 3rd floor without any problems. Our room faced the interstate, but we just turned up the air conditioning didn't have any problems. Overall, this was just an average room. For $140 per night we expected a little more.

<Content>One word: bedbugs! We booked via Expedia for a quick overnight stay in Dallas. The prior reviews on TripAdvisor, and lack of availability of some other favorite hotels, directed us here. My wife checked in before I arrived on a separate late night flight. The hotel itself is very average and has a helpful staff. However, when we pulled back the covers of the king bed (room 311), we found a few bugs crawling on the sheet. A more extensive check of the mattress pad and bottom sheet reminded me why I would not recommend doing this at most hotels -- we found bedbug droppings and more unpleasantness.The staff tried to move us to one of the few available rooms and we found a lesser problem, but still similar. So, at 1pm, we went looking for a hotel room.We worked with Expedia for a credit and this is still unresolved. Expedia requires that the hotel agree to the refund. Some service!So, to everyone else who stayed at the Comfort Inn Dallas Market Square around July 26th, 2007, if you're wondering about those red bite marks on your body, we know the answer. And to the owners of this hotel, get ready for your City of Dallas public health inspection because we filed a complaint.

<Content>The name of the place (COMFORT INN) says it all If you are looking for a clean affordable place to stay that isconveniently located near all and ultra staff friendly, look no further, you've just found it! The Comfort Inn on N. Stemmons Freeway in Dallas offers a wide variety of amenities with no hidden cost.Each room comes complete with it's own work desk and chair,a microwave, coffee pot, refrigerator, lighted make up mirror,blow dryer, satellite/cable tv, and not one, not two, but threeconveniently located phones. There's even one in the bathroom!The room service was really good and the simply comfort of knowing that a hotel attendant was stationed at the front desk at all times was definitely an added plus for someone like me, who thoroughly enjoys the comfort of knowing your safe to sleep in a foreign place with the luxury of having such peace of mind. As a tourist, we truly enjoyed our stay at the Comfort Inn and we're sure that you will too. J.R. from New Jersey

<Content>Convenient location. Excellent value. Stayed 5 nights here for a company regional meeting. Friendly, helpful staff. Free parking, wireless internet and an OK light breakfast. The restaurant is closed but if they got a good manager and opened for breakfast lunch  dinner, they could make a nice profit. Friendly bar with bumper pool. The rooms are adequate but the motel is ready for a complete makeover. I'd certainly stay there again. Good value.

<Content>Close to downtown, nice staff. I didn't have any trouble locating this hotel, contrary to some other feedback left here. Parking was a little sparse, at least in front of the hotel, but I think there were plenty in the back.Check-in without any problems, at least for me; I was given a handicap room since they apparently sold out everything else. Unfortunately, the internet connection didn't work in my room - usually that would have been a problem, but I arrived late and had to leave early anyway so no big deal. I was offered another room, but declined.Everything else worked fine. View from the room was a parking lot, but no noise. Room was perhaps a little small; it's not a destination, definitely just a temporary place to sleep or relax.Breakfast very good; boiled eggs, waffles, etc. Check-out without any problems either. True; you need a car to stay at this place, but when you have one it's easy and fast to get to downtown (about 10 minutes in rush-hour traffic). For the price, I would return to this hotel when on business in Dallas again.

<Content>Very average I stayed at this hotel for three nights (March 17, 18, 19, 2006) while I was in Dallas for the NCAA Basketball Tournament. I selected this hotel because it was close to the American Airlines Center where the games were being played. The rooms were clean and well maintained. I found that the comments from a previous posted about no places to eat close by to be correct. The breakfast area very nice and well stocked, including the usual juice, coffee, pastries, cereal, and waffles. The only negatives, (excluding the weather which caused major flooding problems in the Dallas Area) is the conference room sits right off the lobby/registration area, and both Friday and Saturday nights there were rather large and loud parties being held there which was a little distracting when trying to check in. There is very limited parking for this hotel especially when there are events going on in the conference room. Finally they advertise wireless Internet, which is almost non-existent in many of the rooms. I couldn't connect in my room on the second floor and but was able to connect in the breakfast area. I would stay here again but would probably look around before returning

<Content>Nowhere to eat if you don't have a car Clean and comfortable with very helpful staff particularly the technical support guy when it come to laptops from the other side of the world, but no dining room and no restaurants within walking distance except Waffle House - not my choice of food. To get a hire car you need a taxi to get you there - no pick ups from hire firm - and my request took 45 mins to arrive. OK if you are driving and are NOT hungry! I'll get a hire car at the airport next time, if there is one.

<Content>Very friendly; nice solid hotel Nothing fancy here, but a good respectable hotel. The check-in staff is incredibly friendly and responsive. The continental breakfast is very good (they even have bananas!) My room was clean and comfortable. The wireless internet (free) is sporadic but they let me borrow a cable (no deposit!) and it worked great. The location is very convenient for getting on the highway into downtown or to DFW. I didn't notice any excessive noise from the freeway. The only downside is that there aren't may places to eat close by. All in all, a great deal.

<Content>Just a little hotel in Dallas Arrived on Saturday afternoon and found the Comfort Inn shortly after leaving the airport. This place is conviently off Stemmons Fwy, located several miles north of downtown Dallas. We checked in and were given room 320. It was a very nice room on the opposite side of the freeway. The room has a king size bed, nice bathroom and plenty of closet space. It also comes with a microwave and a refridgerator. The only drawback was a stain on the floor on the right side of the bed. Other than that, it was great! The breakfast consisted of cereal, juice, pastry items, and waffles. Being this close to downtown Dallas, we might have gotten a better breakfast but paid more. There was also plenty of juice and coffee to go around. Overall our stay in Dallas was outstanding. This is a great Comfort Inn that is centrally located to most everything you would want to do in Dallas. We were there for the Cotton Bowl game and it was about a 6 mile drive to Fair Park. Also we ate at two outstanding restaurants while there - Texas DeBrazil and the Texas land  Cattle Company. Also the drive from the airport wasn't bad at all...But beware, those people in Texas drive much like the drivers in Madison County, Alabama...Usually all over the road!!! We'll definately stay here again!!!
