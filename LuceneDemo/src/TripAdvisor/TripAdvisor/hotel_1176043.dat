<Content>Great Villas available for rental - no golf required Located in SE Puerto Rico. Have stayed several times - clean, neat villas, friendly staff and great hosts  ChiChi and his wife.Not many acceptable hotel options in the area but I found El Legado a few years ago while cruising the net - very happy I found ChiChi's place. Not a golfer but the course is in great shape and have heard many positive comments from golfers there.
