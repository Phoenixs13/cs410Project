<Content>Its terrible! I stay in el Parador el Sol last weekend and was terrible. The single room was really small and after 8 pm they remained without water. I went away to sleep without bathing, the stairs stinked out. Pleople was very angry and when we try to make the check out the new credit card machine don not make refunds. The manager gave me the money in cash.This hotel really needs a better administration.
