<Content>good value city hotel If you are looking for good value in a clean and comfortable hotel, I recommend Hotel Jurine. OK it''s not 5 star luxury, but you are not paying 5 star prices. The staff were friendly and the breakfasts enormous! All in all a good find.Just one point, if it is an international hotel, it should have more than just German channels on the TV. At least a news channel in another language would be a bonus.

<Content>The breakfast paradise At each of my four visits in Berlin within the last 3 years I chose a different hotel and this time it was Hotel Jurine's turn. Based on this experience my judgment is that its room rate of slightly below one hundred euros including breakfast may be called moderate for Berlin standards in relation to the comfort and the level of service it provides.Hotel Jurine is situated in the nice Prenzlauer Berg quarter of Berlin, fairly close to the next subway station. From there all the major attractions of Berlin can be reached within reasonable travel time by means of public transport. The quarter itself does not only comprise a lot of beautiful old houses but also numerous restaurants and bars of all kinds in bustling streets like Kastanienallee. Thus, there is no need to take the subway or to walk very far just in order to have lunch or dinner. On the contrary, the choice is so wide that it is difficult to decide where to drop in.The entire hotel seems to have been thoroughly renovated only a short time ago and so everything is in excellent shape. The rooms are decorated with taste and the baths are perfect. The evaluation of the quality of beds is always strongly influenced by personal preferences. For me the mattress and the pillow were too soft. But what bothered me most was the fact that the quilt was so thick that I sweated heavily at night although it was cool in the room.If your room is at the back side of the house there is absolutely no noise coming from the outside and you can leave the window open at night. On the other hand, the rooms are only poorly protected against noise from the corridor. So it depends on the fellow guests how often you get disturbed at night.The TV set in the room conforms to the usual standards. However, I missed a dedicated news channel. As a business traveller I would have wished a better illumination of the desk in the room which apart from that permits reading and doing paperwork comfortably and is equipped with WLAN access.Although quite a few cafes in the vicinity of the hotel serve breakfast I recommend to enjoy Hotel Jurine's comprehensive breakfast buffet. It offers virtually everything one could possibly desire to eat in the morning and I consider it as the hallmark of this hotel. In summer you can even take your breakfast in the beautiful garden behind the house to make the enjoyment complete.

<Content>A great hotel that works at all levels We stayed at Hotel Jurine for four nights and found it superb.Very friendly and efficient reception sevice. The room was clean and well appointed and in a quiet location.The breakfast buffet is excellent with a wide selection of fresh and high quality food served in a spacious seating area with access to an attractive garden.It is located in a quiet part of a busy and interesting area of Prenzlauer Berg with close access to the S Bahn and U bahn and tram services. It is an hotel that 'works' at all levels and is very good value.

<Content>Wonderful little hotel Hotel Jurine on Schwedter Strasse is an absolute gem! What more do you need in a city such as Berlin but a clean room and bathroom and great beds - this hotel has it all. Situated about five minutes' walk from the U-bahn in a quiet area. The only drawback is the elevator which obviously has trouble transporting all guests, so this requires a little patience. The hotel has a parking accommodation which we found quite unique - all I can say about it is that an SUV won't fit, but if you have a normal size car and good driving and manoeuvring skills it's some experience! Friendly staff, wonderful breakfast. An address to remember.

<Content>I enjoyed the hotel I found the hotel to be clean and comforable, it was close to our family and to the U-bahn so that was handy. It was a little expensive but not compared the other boutique style hotels. I found the front desk staff to be friendly, even went out of their way to speak english and look up things for me. The breakfast was expensive but we enjoyed it very much and rarely had to have another meal until late afternoon which is perfect for a tourist! And it is more of a gourmet then a buffet!!!

<Content>They couldn't be bothered, you shouldn't either As a generalisation, the quality of service in Berlin still leaves a lot to be desired. People do their job, more or less, efficiently enough, but don't look for friendliness or a smile or chattiness like you find, say, in London. For most Germans being korrekt and sachlich is what counts and, sadly, for many businesses that deal with people, the customer is still viewed as someone who disturbs the smooth running of the setablishment.This isn't a review of the Jurine per se, because the service I received there was such that the booking is going elsewhere.My father and sister are coming to Berlin in June 2007 so I am looking for rooms for them. I wandered into the Jurine to enquire about availability - two rooms for five nights.If someone comes to me wanting to spend anything up to 鈧?,000 (price including breakfast) I'd have been friendly and welcoming. Not so the woman at the front desk who made me feel distinctly unwelcome. Can't think why since I showered this morning and my German is still fluent. Asking questions about the rooms also seemed too much for her, since she just gave me a leaflet and told me it's all there.And while I'm at it, charging 鈧?3.50 for the breakfast buffet is heavy, especially as any of the nearby caf茅s are cheaper. But then discounting the bill by only 鈧? if you opt out is (are you listening, the management?) is not a selling point. It leaves the customer wondering why they should pay an extra 鈧?.50 for something they don't want!So to sum up: lots of hotels in Berlin. Give your money to people who appreciate it and make you feel welcome.

<Content>not really beautiful but perfectly located at prenzlauer berg one of the view hotels that are located in the middle of prenzlauer berg. hotel jurine is just around the corner of kastanienallee and not far from helmholtz and kollwitz place - which are really nice areas with small cafes, restaurants and individual shops in the eastern part of berlin.design of the rooms is a bit old fashioned but almost new bathrooms and all very clean and quite. plus the service team is very nice. and prices are really okay.
