<Content>Midscale hotel for reasonable price We stayed at this hotel for a leisure stay while on our trip to Dallas. Me and my friends really enjoyed the indoor spa. Oh and we had a really good time because there is this really posh and classy gentlemen's club right next door. I would recommand this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Ugly place, horrible service This hotel is pretty bad. But the worst, in my case, was the service I got my plane cancelled and the airline put me there. When I checked in, they asked me the time of mi flight, I said 10:30. They suggested for me to take the transfer at 9:00, I accepted. Thus, I asked for a wake up call at 8:00.They called me around at 8:05 and informed me that there was no room in the 9:00 bus to the airport, so I should either take the 8:30 or the one at 10!!!The message was clear, rush or miss the plane! When I told the lady that I had CONFIRMED the previos night the 9:00 transfer, she told me that she was just informing me the policy of the manager supposedly someome called Peggy......When I told her I wanted to talk to Peggy, she told me she couldnt talk to me at the timeJust before I took a cab to go the airport I asked for a form to make a complaint. They did not have one. I then asked if I could make the complaint on the internet, she told me NO.....Peggy, maybe you could work in a farm, from what I know, cows do not mind being treated like that.

<Content>Warning! Don't stay here! I am warning everyone--Please do not stay at this hotel!!!!!!! The pictures on the website make it look nice especially for the cheap rate. Hell, that is why me and a group of friends decided to stay here for a birthday weekend. My friends car window was bashed in during the early morning (around 5:15am) and had her expensive GPS system and other items stolen from her car. We contacted the police and they came out to file a report. There are clear shots of the thief on the hotel's surveillance cameras so detectives are currently tracking them down. The officer was quick to warn us that police don't patrol the back area (there are about 4 or 5 hotels all crammed in there). She also pointed out that behind the hotel there is a gentleman's club and that is what these hotels are mostly used for--if you get my drift.... Hence the cheap cheap rates. So beware of thieves and the hookers and other trashy people that are around/staying at this hotel. Also, while waiting for the police to arrive, we overheard another man reporting a stolen vehicle from the same hotel. I hope to warn everyone I can about this seeming good hotel. Do not stay here, especially with family.

<Content>Worst hotel ever! Hotel was run down, grounds looked like a slum area. The entire hotel was filthy. Trash was never emptied in our room the entire 4 days we were there. Will never even stay in a Baymont again based on this experience.

<Content>Avoid this one We stayed at the Baymont Love Field in mid October for four nights. Outside appearance made my wife nervous. Lobby was clean and staff was helpful. Carpeting in the hallways was dirty and loose and folded over when bags were pulled down them. Carpeting in rooms wasn't loose but had large stains and was very dirty. We had to keep our shoes on the entire stay otherwise we would have stained feet or stained socks. Some mildew in the ceiling corners above the tub. Drain stopper in tub nonfunctional. Had to have the room key card reprogrammed each day as it worked sporadically on the second day after issue. Some front desk clerks asked for the name associated with the room before reprogramming .. others didn't.Breakfast buffet was consistently good though in a cramped area.Would not stay here again.

<Content>Horrible!!!! One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in. My flight to NY was cancelled and I was provided a voucher from the airline company. I waited 2hrs for the shuttle to pick me up at the airport. The room had a musty ,moldy smell that seeped into your clothes. The sink was right next to the front door. Stains in the bathroom tub. I couldn't bring myself to touch the bed let alone sleep in it. Though the hotel was horrid, the staff was very nice and provided me with some essentials I needed.
