<Content>Great location and friendly helpful staff Me and two friends stayed at Hotel Augustinenhof for a long weekend in November. The hotel staff were helpful even before we arrived by dealing with my room queries beforehand via email (in English) and then accomodating a last minute change of plans when a triple room was required.We arrived too early in the morning to get to our rooms, but our bags were kept securely while we went off to discover Berlin. The hotel is in the Mitte district of former East-Berlin, which meant that it had more character and a youthful, alternative feel to it. On many corners were cafe's that turned into bars in the evening allowing for long, late slow drinking and eating. The area felt safe and friendly.Our room was spacious, clean, new looking and very quiet (even with building work happening across the road). The TV had no English speaking channels, but who cares. Breakfast was a mixture of continental and cooked food and served until 10am. We didn't eat dinner there as there are many other places to eat in the area. Staff were always friendly and spoke excellent English - they even posted me an undeveloped camera film that we had left in the room - I suspect most hotels wouldn't have bothered.If you are looking for a clean, friendly, good value (拢30 pp per night) hotel in an interesting area of Berlin, near the U-Bahn - you should give the Hotel Augustinenhof serious consideration.

<Content>Lovely and stylish This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. Its located in the trendy Auguststrasse area, full of art galleries and stylish restaurants. Its also walking distance to Hackescher Markt, which has wonderful shops and beautiful architecture, built around a series of inner courtyards. The area is ever so slightly rough around the edges, but not at all unsafe - just still a bit of post-unification restoration taking place. Its a 10 minute walk to the museum island, and a short hop on the U-Bahn to other sights.The hotel itself is a restored religious hostel, built in the 19th century. Its spotlessly clean, with the original wooden floors and original art works everywhere. The beds are outrageously comfortable, and on the coldest day of the year with a foot of snow on the ground, it was snug and cosy. Plus there's a sauna, and a lavish breakfast buffet - I was usually too full to eat lunch. The young staff are friendly and smoothly professional.Go - Berlin is a fascinating city and this is a great little hotel.
