<Content>Close to airport We stayed at the Best Western as we were simply there for a lay over. The hotel is very close to the airport, but if you are not able to contact the hotel to have them pick you up, it will cost you approximately 25 euros as we were told there is a minimum that they must charge. We had no problem reserving our shuttle the next morning.Check in was speedy. Our room was on the 3rd floor and was a pretty good sized room. It looked like the bathroom had recently been remodeled. It was very contemporary and a good size as well. They had your standard shampoos and beauty kits which was nice. They also have hairdryers which is a plus. The room was quiet. We didn't partake in the restaurant but the prices seemed pretty reasonable. The hotel is really not near any shops and is not near the metro so if simply staying for one night- it's no problem. If you're there to visit downtown Barcelona, I would not recommend it.We had pre-paid our hotel and upon check-out, did not have any problems.

<Content>Scary Shuttle Experience I booked this hotel for the last night of a three week trip around Europe. I was by myself at that point, and I only went back to Barcelona to catch my return flight to the U.S. Having stayed in some pretty nice Best Westerns, I figured this would be a perfectly satisfactory place to spend the night. My flight from London arrived in Barcelona at around 10 pm, and it was nearly midnight before I got to the hotel. I watched other hotel shuttles circle around three and four times before the Hotel Alfa van came, and the only thing that prevented me from just going to another hotel was that I had paid for the room in advance. Once the shuttle finally arrived, I boarded with three other men who were apparently inebriated. As a female traveling by myself, I was a little uncomfortable with the situation and just wanted to get to the hotel as quickly as possible. However, instead of going directly to the hotel, we for some reason still unknown to me, stopped along the way in an abandoned car dealership for about five minutes, listening to something on the radio in Catalan. Perhaps it was some type of sporting event? In any case, I was convinced that I was going to be raped, murdered, or both because it is pretty darn sketchy when a hotel shuttle doesn't bring you directly to the hotel. Nothing actually did happen, but it was still one of the scariest moments of my life. Even if I ended up at the nicest hotel on earth after that, I still would have extremely negative associations with this hotel.As other reviews have mentioned, the hotel itself is mediocre. I didn't have any particular problems with the room (or the return shuttle trip), but I certainly was expecting a nicer hotel. At the very least, all I wanted was a direct, uninterrupted shuttle ride from the airport to the hotel that didn't instill the fear of God in me! I wish that I had just taken a taxi back to the Hotel Apart Silver, where I stayed during my actual visit to Barcelona. I probably would have gotten there faster, and it was a fabulous hotel (not to mention that some of the rooms were cheaper than the Best Western!)

<Content>Good airport hotel As far as airport hotels go, this one was good. It was located a few minutes away from the airport and here is our review! :)1) When you arrive you have to CALL the hotel to send the shuttle, which is free, but if you dont call, you could be hanging out for a while. 2) If your flight departs very early in the morning the shuttle does not work, which is fine, but a taxi is expensive, almost Euro 30 so keep that in mind ... 3) The hotel has a VERY good restuarant and we enjoyed dinner  breakfast and the staff was very friendly and we enjoyed their service. The hotel has wifi and the lobby decor very contemporary.4) The rooms are good, well sized, and the bath was nice with good pressure. 5) There is nothing around the hotel to walk to (as would be expected at an airport hotel) so if you're trying to base yourself from there to see Barcelona, it will not be a good idea.

<Content>A fine choice to be near the airport at a lower price than other airport hotels I was a bit nervous booking this with some of the reviews, but for 80E a night for our one night stay (in at 5pm and out at 6am) I figured we'd be fine.First - the location is near enough the airport to qualify as an airport hotel - the shuttle takes about 10 minutes (runs every half hour except at 4pm-5pm which was a bit irritating).Second - we actually found the staff to be especially accommodating - when I made the reservation I asked if we could come to the hotel 3 days before and check excess baggage ( we were taking a quick trip to Malta and only wanted one bag) - they said no problem and true to their word when we arrived they quickly took our bags. Also offered us the use of the shuttle for free even though we weren't guests yet.Room was fine - small but quite nicely decorated and the bathroom has a neat sink as someone mentioned. Free wi-fi in the room.The restaurant and room service hours are a problem if you don't want to eat dinner after 8:30pm although the bar does have nice sandwiches and pizza.So.....we saved a ton of money staying a few minutes away from the airport and were very happy here.

<Content>Functional Booked this hotel as we have a vehicle over 2.1metres high and couldn't find anywhere else in Barcelona to park it.It is on the edges of the fruit/veg market (for this read main HGV distribution area), not by the airport as expected.The room was small, but clean and functional. The 'pool' about the size of anyone else's jacuzzi and facilities poor.On the plus side, the staff helpfully advised on ways to get into Barcelona (there's a bus stop immediately outside).I would certainly not recommend the hotel! We'd have been better parking the Land Rover at the airport and using a hotel in the city centre.

<Content>Use only for overnight stay Just booked one night prior to a cruise. Front Desk rude check-in and check-out. Industrial area. Restaurant expensive and limited times. Stayed after checking rates for hotels and cabs/transfers. A triple room is harder to find and much more expensive then a twin. No regular cab could take 3 passengers plus 5 large suitcases, so the shuttle worked the best for us. The hotel shuttle was fine. The room was ready with the extra cot, new and clean. Faced the front, but must have been too tired to hear the noise. Free internet and 2 computers for guest use.

<Content>Only stay here as a last resort... I've found in the past that Best Western hotels can be a mixed bad. Some are good, some are questionable. I was at a conference in the city and as a result of an admin 'issue' my company didn't book my hotel until the last minute - the Alfa was the only hotel available.The hotel is located some 15 minutes drive from the Airport on the edge of an industrial estate. Inside it is modern and clean with good Wi-Fi access across all rooms (though this was down the first day I was there). Those are the good points My problems started on arrival at the Airport with the supposedly 'regular' shuttle. After waiting over half an hour I gave the hotel a call. They said it was 15 mins away. 15 mins later it went sailing straight past Terminal B as it had a full load from Terminal A. It was some 30 mins later, and after another call, that I was eventually picked up. Throughout my stay the bus proved unreliable and difficult to rely upon. The advertised free service into Barcelona centre is one-way only, and they refuse to pick anyone up on the 2nd drop even though they're going back to the hotel!I was given a no-smoking room on check-in, but when I got to the room it STANK of cigarette's. When I complained, they insisted on walking with me to the room to check out my claims. Only very grumpily (this attitude was representative of the staff attitudes) did they give me another room which was actually a smoking room, but smelt better!! Apparently the locals don't take any notice of no-smoking rules!The bathroom is very nice to look at, being of a modern design, but mine stank of drains/sewers. I loved the design of the sink, but realised how impractical it was when I saw there was no way of filling up the sink as there was no conventional plug hole. You also got a good spray back if you turned on the tap too much, and the step was a real trip hazard.The air conditioning was non-existent and the room was overly warm, and this was November, heaven knows what it would be like in summer! You couldn't have the window open as heavy vehicles outside woke you up, and the walls were paper thin.More seriously for me was that I had to rely on taxi's to get me into the centre - it is nowhere near Barcelona's excellent metro system. Some taxi drivers were good but some obviously tried to fleece tourists. A popular move seems to be to add 'surcharges' for going outside the city limits, or it being a Sunday, when other drivers hadn't applied them! About a third didn't seem to know where it was, even given the address (and many had SatNav!!). Checking out took me 45 mins as the bill was dubious to say the least. With a supposed corporate BB rate, they had charged me for breakfast which they refused to budge on.Stay at a hotel in the ciry - it's cheaper, nicer and with the train service to the airport quicker!!!

<Content>Never book here 15 minutes from the airport by car can be the only good point. Far from anything else : restaurants, town center,...Roads under the windows will not let you sleep as hotel is located in a very industrial area with a lot of trucks passing all the day. Moreover, walls are so thin that you will here your neighbours speak to each other. Last point : the service ! It seems people don't know what it is. During breakfast, I had to wait 10 minutes for somebody to come !?Regarding the price and the quality, this hotel is not a place to go. Avoid booking here is the only advise I can propose.

<Content>bad, bad, bad  This hotel is AWFUL! Stayed one night as we were in Barcelona overnight to make a connection, and this property is listed as 4 stars. The free shuttle van took over 30 minutes to pick us up, then the driver unloaded our luggage on the hotel driveway and walked away. The front desk person told us there was no staff to help with our luggage. Room was tiny, never had hot water (only warm) and the door to our room was so thin all sounds from other rooms and the corridor were heard, in fact if someone knocked on any door near our room we thought it was our room.This hotel is seriously over-rated and Best Western should be ashamed to recommend this hotel or to advertise as a 4-star hotel. Finally: Location! This property is a 15 minute drive to the airport in a simply awful part of Barcelona in an industrial area.

<Content>Bad, bad, bad Let me keep it simple and direct:--NOT near the airport. Horrible location in fact.--No concept of customer service.--Poorly managed restaurant.--Smoke filled.--Unreliable shuttle service.--Unreliable wake up calls.--Cramped rooms.--Minimal amenities.--NO WAY THIS IS A FOUR-STAR HOTEL.--Best Western needs to send someone here as this hotel does a dis-service to the franchise.

<Content>Lovely stay near the airport I stayed in Barcelona for just two days in Alfa Hotel. It is brand-new!!! Totally renewed with wifi-free (very important for me and many laptop-users I think), sauna, swimming-pool, kind staff... I don't understand previous reviews because it is clear that this is an airport-hotel (as it is totally understandable looking at the name: ALFA AEROPUERTO), even with a free bus-service to airport!... Food was great (they say it is because they are 50 meters from Barcelona Groceries Market...) and a very enjoyable stay.I was in a double room. Price was right according to service. My room had a new bathroom... very very nice!My 2 cents.

<Content>Avoid This Place There is only one reason for this hotel to exist: it is (somewhat) close to the airport and so (somewhat) convenient for early morning flights out of Barcelona. Considering this, the Hotel Alfa is amazingly inept at providing this simple service. After two weeks traveling Spain, we booked the Alfa so we would be close to the airport for our 8 a.m. flight back to the U.S. First of all, the hotel really is NOT all that close to the airport. It is probably 5 miles away and that means a 20-30 Euro cab ride, depending on luggage. Don't depend on the hotel van, it runs when they feel like it.And don't depend on a wake-up call to get you on the road. We checked with the front desk twice before going to bed, and they STILL did not place the wake up call. We had to rush as a result. Remember, this is supposed to be an airport hotel. Wake up calls would seem to be a basic, right?The staff borders on rude. They know they will probably never see you again, and they act that way. We asked for extra pillows; had the front desk clerk simply said NO, we might not have been surprised. Instead, he drilled us on why we wanted extra pillows and suggested that we actually didn't need them!! Totally nuts. In the end, they never did send the pillows.The rooms, even on the smoke-free floors, are imbued with years of nicotine. The no smoking rule is simply not enforced. Our friends room included sheets that were riddled with cigarette burn marks...on the no smoking floor! The bathrooms are cramped and badly in need of a facelift and include only the bare necessities.The restaurant food was fine, but the service was, without any doubt, the worst we experienced anywhere in Spain. They must be trained by the same people who train the front desk. Again, this place is supposed to be an airport hotel. Quick, good food served with a smile should be the order of the day. They don't even come close. The Alfa bills itself as a four-star hotel. This is an insult to the rating system. It barely deserves a single star. FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO STAY when trying to be near the airport in Barcelona. You will thank me.

<Content>Just an Airport Hotel I spent one night in the Best Western Alfa Airport after my flight to Paris was cancelled. Air France paid the hotel for me.It's not really an hotel where I would come for vacation, but I have nothing to complaint : room was large and comfortable, staff was polite and the breakfast pretty good. The shuttle service worked well, however it's a little bit weird that an airport hotel like this is not closer from the terminal...

<Content>Terrible Shuttle Service We stayed in this hotel the evening of July 4, we had an early flight to catch back to the US the next day.Even though we didn't wait as long as some other people at the airport for the shuttle (15 minutes), it was understood when we realized how far the hotel was from the airport. I didn't bother to check because the name of the hotel is Alfa Aeropuerto implying they are near the airport.We had already had dinner, so we didn't have to use their restaurant and we had breakfast at the airport.I had higher expectations because it is after all a Best Western and I've had better experiences in the US with that hotel chain, however they have a big plaque at the entrance that reads privately owned and operated, so I think the Best Western folks should audit them once in a while.

<Content>Bad location, bad shuttle service, bad resturant We stayed at the Best Western Alfa Aeropuerto as a transit hotel on our way through the Barcelona airport. Our expectations were not high but even then this place was a huge dissapointment. The hotel is not in fact near the airport but kilometers away by a huge noisy truck depot. We waited over an hour and half for the shuttle to pick us up at the airport and then the driver asked if we would wait another 15 minutes while he made a phone call! There is nothing near the hotel, not transportation or resturants. The hotel resturant has all of the character of a bare windowless room, because that is what it is! Service in the resturant was bad. For periods of 10 or 15 minutes there was not even a waiter in the room. And you have to eat at the resturant because there is no where else nearby to eat. This hotel is a bad choice there are several other airport hotels in the area. We know becuase their shuttles passed us repeatedly as we waited for the Alfa Aeropuerto shuttle.

<Content>Noisy, Noisy, Noisy We stayed at the Alfa hotel in April this year for two nights, as the website we booked our holiday on said it was central and near to all the main attractions. what it forgot to mention was that the centre of town was not within walking distance, it wasn't near to a train station, and the bus stop was too far away. What made it worse was the constant banging and the traffic on the busy main road. We were awakened each morning by 6am when the chambermaids arrived making as much noise as possible! Barcelona was beautiful and definitely a nice place to visit, we just wish we had stayed somewhere a bit quieter and more central

<Content>Good for airport travelers This is a convienent hotel if you are traveling to or from the airport in Barcelona. It's close by and they offer shuttle service. Shuttle service was efficient.You are on the outskirts of the city in an industrial area so there is nothing to do nearby.Room was clean and adequate. Breakfast was very good. Not for sightseeing in Barcelona, a transit hotel only.

<Content>Location not great We arrived late in the evening into the airport and therefore I booked the hotel closest to the airport. The directions that I had got from the hotel website were not very clear and at night it was not the easiest to find.The staff were only ok with the reception staff not being very friendly or civil.On the whole not a good option unless it is a flying visit and other hotels near the area are booked out.

<Content>Bad location While the Hotel itself was very nice, it was located next to a trucking depot with trucks in and out all hours of the night and day. there was nothing else in the general area, and I mean nothing. A free shutle to the Airport was great as well as the free shutle to the center of Barcelona. Restaurant in Hotel was also very nice with good food. Air conditioning, so-so.

<Content>Horrible Location! We stayed at the Best Western Alfa for one night in April 2004, as we needed a place near the airport. Well, it is quite a way from the airport and nestled in the middle of a huge industrial area. There were warehouses as far as the eye could see. Nothing at all but warehouses!But, at night when the trucks were gone, we were able to see the lights of the city through a wall of windows in the room.The hotel is HIGH on service. If you wanted your butt kissed, they might consider it. grin The room was large and comfortable. There was a classy restaurant and a bar in the hotel. I guess this hotel had just about everything you would want except LOCATION!We paid about $86 euros for one night.
