<Content>Long on scenery, short on everything else We stayed at the Guajataca with a large group of family and friends for a local wedding. The hotel is clean and the staff very friendly and accomodating once you ask them for whatever it is that you want. It has a basically local clientele and as such is not up to the tourist oriented hotels that you find nearer San Juan or in the resort areas. The view is magnificent and rivals any worldwide (and I've seen many), but the hotel itself is getting long in the tooth. One really big negative was the noise! The outside bar is open Thurs, Fri, and Sat from midnight until the wee hours (0530!). The music rocked the walls and it was impossible to sleep. We had a great stay because of the nature of our group and really enjoyed the warm reception of our Puerto Rican hosts in nearby Isabella, however, this would never be on my list of vacation destinations otherwise.

<Content>Looks like Paradise..... My husband and I just returned from a 2 night stay at the Parador El Guajataca. I had been visiting the Parador since the early 80's and always considered it a beautiful place to stay. I had not been able to visit for the past 7 years and they have made tremendous changes to the property. The lobby is really beautifully done with faux stone and they now have a stairway that brings you to a lovely deck with gorgeous views. The rooms are still not large but who stays in the room anyway when you have such beautiful surroundings. : ))) The rooms have been redone however and are done very nicely in dark woods. All of the rooms have balconies that look out to the pool area and the gorgeous beach. If you stay for 2 nights or more, you can get a package deal that includes breakfast and lunch. The menu was a little limiting but if you can find something that you like it is well worth taking the package offer. You can also drive into the town of Quebradillas to eat. There are a couple of fast food places as well as some of the local cuisine that is very good. Plus there is a grocery where you can stock up on some stuff. One note of caution, from June-August a summer camp is there and the noise level is quite loud by the pool area and if you are located in a room near the pools you can still hear the noise with the door shut. Parador El Guajataca is a place that should not be missed...Hope you enjoy your stay!!

<Content>good hotel, but... Very nice view, pools where excellent but rooms are in need of a renovation asap. Food was good but not much to choose from. Bar ok but did not have any ice for the rooms or DRINKS. This hotel can be such a special place if only they renovated the place. Also did not like the fact that we had to share the pool with people that are not staying in the hotel. I hope the management reads this too. The got alot of work to do.

<Content>The best view and inexpensive to boot If you are loking for luxury and pampering, go elsewhere. If you want the most gorgeous view and a patio to look off of, sounds of ocean waves to lull you to sleep, stay here. Great for kids with a playground and pool. I have been there  10 times. Bakery and retaurants nearby.I have been to Puerto Rico  20 times for business and love to come here for privacy and the view

<Content>Hated It!!! We stood one night, it was like staying @ a cheap motel except for the view. It was like pulling teeth to get clean towels and the room was very dull. The view was nice but nothing extravegant. The pool was really the only nice thing although we had to wait for the life guard to show up. ( he was late) I would never, ever return there. The soda machines were broken. The ice machine was no where to be found. It really wasn't a nice stay at all. Sorry

<Content>This Hotel ---- !!!!!!!! My girl and I stood at this hotel WHAT a BIG mistake.... We payed $140.00 for the night and they dont even have room service. They are worse than a cheap motel. The vending machines do not work. The restaurant was very expensive and serves only sea food. What about people that are allergic to sea food? The room was nasty with peeling walls and the A/C work as loud as a truck. The did not gave us shampoo, rinse or nothing in the bathroom. Anyway I do not recommend this place. It s----.... It can not be rated....

<Content>Dont Stay Here!!!!!! My husband and I were suppose to stay for 4 days we only stayed 1 night. This place is terrible I spent the whole enitre night killing bugs and roaches in the room. The food in the restaurant had a bug in my rice. I was so disapointed this place has a wonderful view of the ocean but the cleanliness is terrible. The room was so dirty I didnt even want to lie on the bed. For the amount of money this place charged us for a night you could go further up to Aguadilla and stay at El Cielo Mar and get a wonderful room with delightful people. Thats what we did, thank god we were able to get a room at that place. I would not stay in the hotel even if the room would be free of charge. Please no one stay here, my husband and I stood 2 nights in San Juan at the Hilton what a difference to this place.

<Content>Beach, palm trees, waves right off the balcony. My husband and I stay here often when we are in PR. It serves as a weekend getaway from the professional responisbilites that bring us to PR every year. It is not a hotel that exists to serve Americans, it is where PR families stay for their vacations. The rooms are minimal, hard beds, basic shower, but clean. If you are looking to get a pampered hotel stay, don't go there. While the surf is too rough to swim, everything else about it is wonderful. While I have been to many beachfront hotels, more often than not: the hotel is on the beach alright, but you can't see it unless you get outside and walk a bit. Here every room faces the beach, you can just experience it sitting on your balcony. Just north of there, up the highway, is a senic overlook that is breathtaking. And if you are adventurous enough, you will eat lunch from the vendor that parks up there, very delicious authentic PR food! Back at the hotel, you can walk along the shore, scramble over rocks until you reach the spot where a small river/creek opens into the ocean. Often you will see local families coming there to swim. Most of the time you will be the only mainlanders there. You definitly need a car. There are a couple of decent restaurants in the area, one has a tables on a porch so even as you eat you can look out over the water. Very relaxing, very Carribbean!

<Content>Beautiful location, but needs renovations I have been visiting this parador regularly since 1991. It offers a beautiful view of the Atlantic Ocean, a serene atmosphere and is right on the beach. It's seems each time I visit, the conditions have deteriorated a little more. Although I love the location and the staff who are very friendly (they remember us year after year), I am extremely disappointed with the conditions of the property. This parador has an enormous amount of potential but has not yet taken advantage of it. It has a good restaurant and an okay pool. The rooms desperatley need upgrading (nothing has changed since 1991). The air conditioning was not working properly in several rooms (I heard other guests complaining too). The bathrooms need renovations and the pathways to pool and beach areas need to redone. They need to expand the hours for the pool (they open around 9:00 or 10:00am and close around 6:00 pm) and consider maybe actually putting a bar in the pool area. The grounds need to be maintained a little bit better as well. They recently added a small game room with pinball machines and a couple of arcade games which is great because there is always alot of families with children vacationing there. During my most recent stay (April 2004), I was told that they may be receiving a loan to renovate the parador. I hope that this is true because all in all this really is a beautiful location and I truly would love to continue staying there for many years to come.

<Content>Great Deal - But Remember its a Parador! This is a parador located on the beach, but unfortunately the waters may be too rough for swimming directly in this location, although you could consider a walk along the shore! The view is beautiful, though, and rooms have terraces overlooking the beach. Keep in mind, this is a reasonably priced parador (sometimes rates include breakfast), so it does NOT have the luxuries of a large hotel (such as you might find in San Juan). The beds are a little hard - but I found that they did wonders for someone like me who has back problems! There is no room service, but there is a small restaurant on the premises. The staff is most accommodating! All in all, for the area and the price, it is a a good deal.
