<Content>Clean, quiet airport hotel Spent just one night here but will go back for a longer stay next time. Conveniently located near Sea-Tac. Rooms were clean and well-decorated. Ours had a microwave and fridge in addition to coffeemaker and hairdryer.Hotel offers expanded continental breakfast including waffles, hard-boiled eggs, and yogurt.No problems with aircraft noise, comfortable beds.

<Content>What a dump We missed a connecting flight and Air Canada put us up in the hotel for a night. What a terrible hotel. NOTHING Quality about it!The hotel was dark, dirty and smelly.The lady at the front desk was nice but that's about as good as it got. We were almost afraid to sleep between the sheets. The bed was terrible and the bathroom was old and dirty. We could not wait to get out of there.Stay somewhere else!

<Content>not great, but ok in situation We were shuffled to this hotel during the windstorm because the place we had was out of power. The hallways were dirty, needed vacuumed. They jacked up the price by at least $25 cause they knew they had us, so to speak. The room was clean, very basic.They had a great shuttle driver, Jimmy!! they were very accomodating in getting us around in the van. let us stay in our room past the check out time because our flight was delayed.Overall, ok in a pinch.

<Content>Cannot recommend this property I can not recommend this property. The halls are very dingy, the carpets need to be replaced. The room just ok, no elevators, have to lug suitcase up a dirty stairway. We traveled 15 hrs., and were exhausted. Got to the hotel at midnight. We were awoken by the night desk clerk at 3:00 a.m., asking if the people who stayed in our room the night before, could come up and get some things they left in a dresser drawer. No, was the answer, but will put the drawer outside the room. At 3:15 a.m. phone rang again. Desk clerk said the people wanted to come up and search the room because some items were missing. Absolutely not, come back in the a.m. It was a poor decision of the night desk to wake us up and ask such a question. Also, housekeeping should have been more thorough in cleaning the room from the night before. We should not have paid for the room. Contacted the hotel mgm. after we got home, and after 6 wks, no response. Contacted Corporate and they sent us a gift certificate for a stay in another property. Would not stay here!!

<Content>Agree with previous reviews We were bumped from a flight at Sea-Tac and the airline made arrangements for us to spend the night at this property. The shuttle service in both directions was prompt. When we checked into the hotel the desk clerk indicated that we would be in an airport distress room. It was located on the first floor (in the basement). The room was clean enough, but the carpets were in terrible condition - especially in the hallways. The room was dark and smelled musty. Cigarette smoke from the neighboring non-smoking room driffted into our room. Breakfast was good - fruit, cereal, waffles, danish, yogurt, etc. Overall, we didn't think that our stay was terrible, but definitely not as nice as most Choice Properties. If we had paid for the room, I would have been disappointed.

<Content>Unpleasant Odor and Appearance Our initial impression of this Quality Inn is that the facility has been heavily used for several years with no investment in upkeep. There were stains on all the carpets, no elevator to get luggage to the basement level, bedding that was worn out, and the odor of cigarettes permeated everything, even though our room was non-smoking. There are other hotels in the same vicinity that looked like far better choices. Even though the staff was cordial, I would not stay here again nor would I recommend it to anyone else.

<Content>Worst Quality Inn I've ever experienced I booked for 3 nights over the internet, having been very satisfied with Quality Inns other places. This one did not live up to those standards. The room was clean, the lobby attractive, the staff friendly, but the physical condition of much of the building leaves a lot to be desired. The hallways stink and the carpet is filthy! It was so bad that the smell carried into the room; I walked down to 7-11 to get some room deodorizer to cut through it. With a generous amount of that, then leaving the window open, it finally got better by the next morning. No elevators. Lots of physical upgrades needed. The front desk person told me that since they were an airport hotel the standards are lower for Quality Inn there. Ouch!!I've always known what to expect at Quality Inn, but this one has me doubting I'll ever take a chance again!

<Content>A simple establishment Stayed at the Quality Inn for 1 night (June 9).We arrived late Friday and had no problem finding parking or checking in. The staff were friendly and easy going. The lobby is small and had a few guests watching the TV and using the one computer with Internet access.Our room was one floor up (no elevators) and was clean. The carpet is old but one of the staff commented that management was going to redo all the carpeting. You could tell there was gum and other gunk in places on the carpet but it was more old than dirty.The main floor hallway had a strong smell of smoke but our 2nd floor hallway was OK.Bathroom was simple. The sink and mirror are part of the room. Our room had a microwave and a fridge. Local calls were free. We couldn't hear our neighbors even though it was apparently 100% full that night. That said the building is old and wood-frame so I wouldn't be surprised with some of the other reviews. One of our friends couldn't sleep because of the occasional airplane flying overhead.Breakfast was very simple, with cereal, the standard waffle-iron waffles, coffee and juice.I'd stay again but then I again there are many other hotels in the area so I might try a neighboring one.Overall, no real complaints. It's no Holiday Inn but then it doesn't pretend to be. Clean room, nice staff, cheap rates.

<Content>Thankful We could stay at the hotel after an emergency at the airport and treatment at the hospital. The room was clean and had everything we needed, great shower and nice smelling bathsoaps. Breakfast was good. Most of all, the people working at the hotel were very friendly. We had stayed at the Holiday Inn in Renton one night before, which was 150% more expensive and only half as nice. So thank you, quality inn, for living up to your name!

<Content>Major Disappointment Stayed one night previous to boarding a cruise to Alaska. Room was on 1st floor, which appeared to be the cellar. No elevators.Had to lug bags down stairs, then up again in A.M. Bedding was so worn and sheets so thin you could see through them. Hall and room carpets were worn and soiled. Breakfast was average. I cancelled return reservation. Price was low for over 60 age group but certainly not up to Choice Hotels standards. I do not recommend this location to anyone.

<Content>Yucky We walked in and stayed at this Quality Inn for Sat. May 26, 07. Paid $69 + tax for the room, room 116 it was. Dim hallways, no elevators, smell smoke everywhere. Everything is true in the review dated Jan 7, 2007. Blankket and all sheets, pillow and mattress were very flimsy. But can't turn the strong AC off since it's very stuffy so we were to wear more clothes to bed, esp. when there's not enough blankets for warmth. It was clean (enough). Lighting is dim throughout the hotel. Fridge and microwave in the room. We actually saw many plane crew members stay here too - to my surprise. Good location for the airport, great value esp. with breakfast, but we wouldn't wanna stay there ever again.P.S. there's a small casino right across the street for those who are interested.

<Content>Not likely to return We were flying out early in the morning, so decided to drive down and stay at an airport hotel and park our car for 8 days. Quality Inn had the best deal price-wise. The good: The price. The staff were helpful, friendly, efficient and knowledgable. The driver to the airport was on-time and friendly (shuttle runs every half hour). A free breakfast is available from 4:30am on, and is not bad...coffee, orange juice, muffins, danish, and a waffle maker. Showers had good pressure and hot water. There was a fridge and safe in the room. Location is right by the airport.The bad: the hotel hallways are really dirty and run down. New carpeting and a serious cleaning job needed. Room was ok..bed was a bit soft, and the sheet were quite thin. There is no elevator. For one night it is livable, but I wouldn't go back if I had a choice. It served the purpose we needed, and our car was fine when we returned (in a lit parking area in front of the hotel. Good size stalls).Safe travels,E

<Content>Sorry, not again Unfortunately, when Quailty Inn took over this previous Travel Lodge they may not have been aware of the poor building quality. This hotel is listed as 3 stars on many sites. The staff is friendly and if the star rating was based strictly on amenities found within the room (mini fridge, microwave, hair dryer, iron and board etc) I too would give it 3 stars. But the hotel itself is a older building with paper thin walls and the floors constantly squeak as guests walk up and down the halls and back and forth in the very very small rooms. If you arrive late parking will also be a challenge due to the limited number of spaces with in the fenced property. There are many other newer 1 and 2 star hotels in the area that would give you a better nights sleep. I would avoid this hotel.

<Content>Basic  We were doing a reverse park and fly, shuttle was excellent! Car safety we felt was good as well. Room basic, clean but nothing great. Just a place to shower and rest your head. Staff was very helpful. We noticed a couple of gentlemen airline staff also using the hotel.

<Content>It'll Do This is a very basic motel, not for the picky. The sheets were clean, the interior hallways were restricted to key holders and the room odors were not as strong as the hallways.The vinyl flooring as a tub surround was a feature I have never seen before, but it served its purpose. I chose to keep my shower shoes on while using the shower.The car storage was safe and reasonably priced and the airport pickup/dropoff was timely. Airport noise was less than we've encountered at the Radisson and Holiday Inn.The staff was friendly and helpful and there was a small breakfast area in the lobby.The price was reasonable for the quality provided, but you won't feel like you are on vacation. If all you need is a clean bed for a night and a safe place to store your car- this will do for many.
