<Content>Worth the money We stayed there for two nights after a long flight from Europe. Arrived at 1 a.m. , no problem to check in.Room was spacious, clean, Wifi worked fine, basic breakfast, good location when you come from the airport or want to go to places like Santa Monica. Would definately stay there again.

<Content>decent stay The place was clean, safe, and friendly. The beds were a little hard, but relatively comfortable. The continental breakfast was adequate. Overall pretty good, and the place was a few miles from Venice beach which is rather convenient.

<Content>Good Location We stayed at the Super 8 Motel because its location is close to the beaches in California. It is very convenient to Venice Beach and only a short drive to the Santa Monica Pier. The location of the motel is a little tricky to find. Follow the Washington signs carefully as there is a Washington Blvd. and a Washington Place crossing each other. It is easy to get turned around.The front desk staff was unfriendly. They were not able to accommodate our family (with our disabled son) in a first floor room as we had requested and didn't seem to care. On the 2nd floor, we ended up in the room over the main office. The room was HUGE! Ask for it by name.The neighbourhood is not the nicest but we felt pretty safe. I must admit that I looked outside first thing in the morning to make sure our rental car was still there.There are pop machines on site and a lovely little pool. The room was clean and the shower pressure was adequate. The beds were comfortable as well.I wouldn't stay there a week but for a day or two, it it satisfactory.
