<Content>Ten men went to Berlin..... Two night stay in hotel on room only basis. Hotel staff were friendly and attentive (lending Nokia charger and organising taxis etc). Plently of supermarkets (with cafes) near hotel and tube station 5 min walk. Italian restuarant next to this is excellent as is Irish themed pub.Decor in hotel requires some cosmetic work but dont let this put you off a very pleasant hotel.

<Content>VERY Friendly staff and nice hotel I showed up at the hotel with my 3 year old daughter and 4 large suitcases after a long, transatlantic flight. The hotel staff was so very understanding and friendly. They helped us get situated when we were there and went out of their way to make sure our stay was comfortable. For example, they offered my daughter little candies, a small toy, and a disney comic book right when we got there. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel, especially if you're looking for a place near the Tegel airport, but also just for visiting Berlin. From the hotel, it's a 5 minute walk to a subway station, from which you can get downtown in 10-15 minutes.

<Content>Loved the Carat, Great Fruhstuck For the money, it was totally worth it. The best Fruhstuck that we had in Berlin, great meat and deviled eggs with caviar. It was close to the airport. The room was clean. The road outside was a little bit noisy. Bathroom was clean. Very easy access to the train and less than 10 Euros to the airport. The staff were great and spoke excellent English. We only stayed one night on the way to conference to Potsdam so I can't comment on how close or easy it was to get to the heart of Berlin. Very reasonable price, would totally stay here again.
