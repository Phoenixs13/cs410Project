<Content>Great Hotel The Hotel entrance was very welcoming clean and modern. It took awhile to check in though and there was no friendlyness by the receptionist - also no information was given to us about the hotel for example breakfast times or directions to the roomOnce we have located our room it was very clean and up to date - we had no views though !!The bathroom was fab walk in shower and Jacuzzi bath also great that they provided towels and some toiletries.The rooms were also serviced every day to a very high standardBreakfast was very good there was enough there for everyones tastes. It was in the basement of the hotel. It was very clean and the buffet was kept refreshed the staff were very attentive and always cleared your table once you had finished. The Hotel was a bit outside of the hustle and Bustle of Barcelona . The Hotel gave us a map of the area so we could locate the underground station which was only a 5 minute walk to and we found it very safe to walk through after dark. It was only a 10 minute underground ride to the centre of the City. Getting a underground ticket was easy to as the machines could be translated to English.

<Content>Great Hotel Had a great 4 days at this hotel. The staff were very helpful and spoke good english the bar staff very jolly and made a nice stay.One downside was the evening meal in the resturant was mediocre. Breakfast fine though. Locally there was an excellent choice of resturants to eat at reasonable prices. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Very nice hotel The Hotel Catalonia Suite is a very nice 4 star hotel in Barcelona. The rooms are modern and new with comfy beds and nice marble and granite bathrooms. The only bad part of our rooms was that the windows opened not to the outside, but to an interior courtyard that was designated for smokers. The hotel is two blocks from a metro station that will take you to the center of the city and the major plazas. It is in a quite more residential neighborhood where the apartments sell for very high prices. I did not like that the TV was broken, but I didn't have time to use it anyhow and the staff was indifferent. They were fairly rude in helping me find a camera memory card I left in the hotel after my departure and said it disappeared.

<Content>Great hotel, quiet location All in all this is a great hotel. It is incredibly clean and the rooms are huge with the whirlpool jet bath and separate shower room being top quality. The front desk staff were able to sort out my complicated booking without any problems, although when the air con failed in the room the language barrier seemed to prevent them understanding the problem. Breakfasts are excellent, but if you get the chance check out the Toscana diner across the road. There's also a handy corner shop on route to the train station (5 mins walk away) for any small essentials you need.

<Content>Decent Hotel I have stayed In Catalonia Suite Hotel for a couple of nights in October. It was enjoyable but I am not sure I would rate this hotel as 4 star, it just lacked this extra something. Don't get me wrong everything was fine, clean but jut not outstanding. I found service a bit abrupt, smile does not cost antyhing! On the postitve side - breakfast buffet was very good and the bathrooms are very well equipped. Location is ok although not central - very easy to get around on metro. The closest station is app 7min walk.

<Content>Its a great luxury hotel This is a great luxury hotel. The rooms are huge compared to other Spanish hotels, and all rooms have a large chair to sit in. The room contained a minibar, but there was room for a waterbottle or two. The bathrooms were the best part. There was a glass-doored shower and a whirlpool jet bath for your use. The shower, however, overflows after a certain amount of time. The bathtub was relaxing after a long walk in Barcelona. The food was very good, including the breakfast buffet in the morning. There is an oven in the restaurant area that allows the eaters to watch and smell the rolls baking. The one thing that keeps this hotel from being 5 star is the service. Don't put out the do not disturb sign, they don't even care, they will still clean the room. The people at the front desk are very rude to you if you have a problem at the hotel. Also, the hotel has internet access, but it's an absurd price. 2 euros for 10 minutes. Overall a great experience.
