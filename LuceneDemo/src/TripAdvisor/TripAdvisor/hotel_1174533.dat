<Content>Excellent place We got this place through Priceline, too, and were very pleased with everything it had to offer. Perhaps thanks to my Hhonors membership we got put in a suite (not a studio) which was spacious, modern and very well equipped. During the weekend, we had no problem parking on the street - just had to feed the meter at 8 am Saturday morning. Monday we had to pay $25 to park in the garage, which is expensive but unfortunately quite normal for big cities. Room was quiet, just like we asked for. I do believe that rooms facing Pike St will get a ton of noise from I-5 running just below in the trench. It had central AC/heat which worked ok. Water pressure wasn't adequate though and especially Saturday morning proved challenging when it came to hot water. Breakfast is awesome! Waffles, cereal, breads, fruit, yogurt, eggs, granola bars, etc. Nicely presented, big area and good seating looking out on Pike St. Don't miss it, especially since it's included.We'd love to return here next time we come to Seattle.

<Content>At Home at the Homewood Stayed here one night while attending a conference at the Hyatt Hotel, which is across from the Convention Center. From the moment I walked in, I felt like I was at home. The staff was very friendly and accomodating with special requests. The suite was a little larger that typical and was very clean with everything in good working order. Wireless worked perfectly. Bathroom was plenty big enough and clean.The evening reception included hamburgers with all the fixings that night and were tasty, along with beer, wine, soda, etc. There was no need to leave for an expensive dinner. It is a few minutes walk to the convention center and the downtown free transit zone. With the free transit zone, you can get on a bus and go just about anywhere downtown - makes the hills not as much of a challenge! I would stay here again in a heartbeat, especially if had my family with me.

<Content>Would not recommend We stayed at this hotel in downtown Seattle on Pike St. in July 2008. It had recently become a Homewood Suites and you could tell that the lobby area had been newly renovated. It just goes to show you though, don't judge a book by its cover. I stay at many Hilton properties for business travel and this hotel was not up to standard. The staff was Seattle hip but not particularly helpful and friendly. They didn't really get the concept of making sure the customer was happy. I was told one thing over the phone before I arrived regarding roll away beds, and given a completely different answer when I got there. I made a special request to accommodate allergies that other hotels can manage, and they couldn't do without a lot of phone calls and proding. Our room was small and cramped. It would be fine for one person, but not for three. We were not comfortable there. In fact, we had booked additional days which I promptly canceled and we moved to another location. Lots of the rooms face the freeway, so be aware of the noise factor if you do book there. We would definitely not stay there again.
