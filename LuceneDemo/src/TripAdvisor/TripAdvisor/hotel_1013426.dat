<Content>Beautiful nice new hotel Its a new young clean and surprising hotel, mostly for a young people trying to save some money on hotels in Berlin. Very significant value for money. The food wasnt that good, there was no variety of food to pick at the morning, but who cares, it's really not about eating. Just walk 3 minutes out of the hotel and take a beautiful breakfast for 6-9 euro. Its absolutely ok. The rooms are clean, well designed (ikea stuff), beautiful view...Really nice place to stay, if your are looking to be in the city center - several minutes from Alexanderplatz. Urban station right in front of the hotel.Very recommended.
