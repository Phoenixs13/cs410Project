<Content>Good Hotel to Stay at I am writing this review 3 days into a 5 day stay at the Comfort Hotel Kanda. We have a twin room booked-yes, it is small, but all rooms are small in Tokyo.The price is reasonable, and for that you get your room, a free Japanese/Western style breakfast and the standard amenites Comfort Inns provide. I used the over 50 discount which saves some money.The hotels website gives good instructions to find it, although make sure you exit from the East exit of Kanda station. It is about 5 blocks (short blocks). There's not a lot to do in the neighbourhood, but really all I was looking for was a hotel with good proximity to the Yamanote Line, and this one fits the bill. The Kanda area near the hotel is quiet--small streets...not like Shinjuko, more quiet. There are lots of restaurants near by, and a 7-11 about 1.5blocks away where you can use foreign ATM cards without a problem.Would I stay here again..yes.(I have stayed also at the Sunroute Hotel Shinkuku, which is more expensive for 2 people and room size slightly larger, but no free breakfast).

<Content>Good value for money The Comfort Hotel Tokyo Kanda is a clean, basic chain hotel located in a central part of Tokyo. It is located about ten minutes walk east of Kanda station, which is one stop north of Tokyo station on the Yamanote line - the main circle line around Tokyo. It is new and like all hotels in this chain in Japan, has complimentary breakfast (self-service), free coffee and tea in the lobby and free Internet access near reception. The room I stayed in was very clean and new, although, as usual in Japan, not very big. The bathroom was the typical preconstructed unit bathroom - again, small, but new and clean. The bed was very comfortable and there is a brand new TV with lots of mostly Japanese pay TV and video options for 1,000 yen a day. Free internet access is available in your room as well. The breakfast was basic, but for the price (I paid 9,400 for a Economy Double room including breakfast) you can't really complain. The hotel is located in a fairly quiet part of Kanda, but there are a lot of restaurants and izakayas near the station. It is not a particularly interesting neighbourhood, but as the Yamanote and Chuo lines run through Kanda station there is easy access to all of Tokyo.My only criticism would be that the hotel is not well equipped to cope with a full house. There is only one small elevator and it often took quite a long time to come and soon filled up, followed by stops on almost every floor. The breakfast area is also too small to handle a large number of people, although the hotel did extend breakfast hours on the day I stayed there to make some allowance for this. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you wanted to stay somewhere not too far from Tokyo station or the Yamanote line and were only after a clean, basic place to sleep.
