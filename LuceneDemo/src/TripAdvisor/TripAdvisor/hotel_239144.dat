<Content>Feel At Home I've been staying for years. Located 100 meters from the Amsterdam Hilton the Casa Cara is in a wonderful neighborhood. 2 minutes to Vondelpark. Clean, friendly,reasonable prices, family owned,nice breakfast in a pleasent dining room. Tony and his lovely wife will take good care of you. No. 2 or 16 trams will connect you too all of the city.Pleasent stores  shops near by in a nice neighborhood. Walk to great restaurants close by. Get a taste of a real Dutch neighborhood. Sidewalk cafes,supermarket etc.real close. Owners live on premises, always there to help you. Short walk thru the park to museum area. Quiet, safe neighborhood; friendly locals. I can't wait to return!

<Content>we liked it it has been quite a long time since we honeymooned there...actually it was november of 1998...no real services but it was clean and easy to get to....we spent most of our time being tourists and this inexpensive spot was just right for us.....
