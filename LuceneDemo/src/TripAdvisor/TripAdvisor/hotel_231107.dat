<Content>Great location This small hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of most of the main sights, with a metro station just round the corner.Our room was large and comfortable, although the carpet had seen better days, and the breakfast was more than we could ask for.There are good restaurants for dinner quite close. The staff were as helpful as they could be given that they do not all speak English, a few words of German really helps.We will stay there again.

<Content>You can do better This hotel, in a great location, has seen its better days. the first room in front was so noisey that we felt we were in the middle of the street. they moved us to another room where the carpet had been cleaned so many times that it was multi colored. the front dest help spoke poor english and was no help at all. at night the hotel was locked and the lobby was dark. it was very inhospitable place.

<Content>LITTLE GEM What a little gem! We found this hotel by surfing the net and would certainly recommend it. Really central, with the underground just round the corner in Gendarmenmarkt, a beautiful square with two churches and a concert hall. The bedrooms are clean and very comfortable, breakfast was good and the (all female) staff helpful and friendly. The area is surrounded by cafes and restaurants (try the Brasserie on the other side of the square), and the shops in the nearby arcade are to die for - try the food section of Galerie Lafayette! We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Berlin.

<Content>This is a lovely little hotel - - my favorite in Berlin I found this hotel quite by accident, looking for a good rate online. Previously in Berlin, I had stayed at the Hotel Unter den Linden, and found it to be satisfactory at best. It felt more like a pension than a hotel. So I lucked out and found Hotel Gendarm! It's a truly lovely hotel. My room really was more like a suite, with a separate sleeping area, and a small kitchen type arrangement. The views out the front of the Gendarmenmarkt are spectacular and it's close to everything, including the U-bahn, which is literally across the street. The windows are big and open easily. Everything was clean and in good working order. It's a small hotel, very quiet. They lock the door at night and you must use your key to get in the front door, but then again a lot of the smaller hotels in Europe are like that. The room service was wonderful and this was a very comfortable and nice hotel. I will definitely stay here again. I heard no noises at night, the bathroom was decent size. I didn't try the breakfast because I was feeling afraid to use my not-very-good German. Really nice hotel.
