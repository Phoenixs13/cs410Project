<Content>Clean and new but far from city center I stayed here for one night and paid $64 USD through hotels.com. The price did not include breakfast.Location is far from the city center, but the Fontana metro station is a 10 minute walk away. It'll take you two transfers from the airport and a lot of walking. There's really nothing to do in the area, but it has a few shops nearby where you can pick up bottled water and bread for a breakfast to go.The hotel room was VERY clean with hardwood floors and even a flatscreen tv. The bathroom was also clean, but I had no shower door so water leaked out of the shower and slightly flooded the bathroom. However, that was managable.

<Content>Less than expected... I booked this hotel after searching for hours and for most of `good` options on the price range I wanted to pay, always had a bad review somewhere... but this one had good or `okay` ones only.As most of reviews for hotels in Barcelona say, personal there is not well trained and they sound quite rude. I guess it is a cultural difference, as I am brazilian and living in London, I am really not used to people being cold when they are actually working for me. Here and in brazil people uses to smile a lot more and use words like please, thank you, sorry... in London they do it a lot.Anyway, the room was really small, smaller than expected, the window was locked and could not be opened. As Barcelona in summer time is a really hot place, we did not want to open that window and just let the air con on all time we were inside. The bathroom had a big window and it was not locked, which was great... for the first 4 days. Out of blue they locked the bathroom`s window one day (while cleaning i guess) and we had no key for it. I asked on the reception and they came up with this absolute nonsene about being against the local law to open those windows, because they were too big.It was an awful experience to use a bathroom with no windows... they should train that people to came up with better excuses, put smaller and open window or an air con inside bathroom as well.I don`t think this hotel is a good option as it is a bit far from everything and it is not a good value for money. I definitily not going back there.

<Content>About my Experience with Via Augusta Everything was fine, no noise if you close the window, a little to poor breakfast but OK. Personnel not very friendly and did not involved in solving problems: for example, after 3 nights of staying at Via Augusta, my pyjamas dissapeared!!! I told to all receptionists about this but they did nothing about this for 3 more days! This left me a bad impression: they told me that I can buy a new pyjamas and the hotel will pay but it was almost midnight in the last night spent there: too late. Besides, I was only looking for hearing something like: WE ARE VERY SORRY FOR THIS, AND APPOLOGIZE, not to buy me a new pyjamas!!! Sometimes, a nice word values equal to thousand pyjamas! That's why I said personnel not very friendly (or maybe not very well trained). And now I remember a holiday in Bulgaria (Hotel Krystal - Golden Sands): my boyfriend forgot a jacket on the tennis field and after 2 weeks when we go back there (we live in Constanta - Romania, at 150 km away and go there frequently) we found the jacket at the Reception. More than a jacket, we get a smile!

<Content>Great location and breakfast! We stayed at the Via Augusta for a weekend at the end of March '08. At first we asked for a room opposite of the street, as we had read at this site below, that there could be noise from the street. But what a mistake! We got a room without a window. So we asked for a new room, which was much better. There is a metro stop nearby, which makes it very easy to reach the center. The breakfast included eggs, sausages, pastry, fruit, ect. everything! It was so great :)The staff was friendly and they even arranged for us to eat breakfast half an hour before it normally opened on our day of departure and a early flight. Near by we found a great local tapas bar, but don't remember the name of it. We can definetly recommend the Via Augusta.

<Content>excellent I had an excellent days at hotel Via Augusta from Barcelona. the hotel is very clean, quiet - if you choose rooms at Via Augusta superior - which means that are renovated rooms - and the breakfast is very tasty. Fontana metro station is very near - 4 minutes.

<Content>Perfect 2 star Hotel Via Augusta is a great little hotel in the new quarter, really convenient for metro and in a good safe neighborhood for walking. Great shopping nearby on Diagonal, walking distance to La Sagrada Familia. I was in a single room, which was much larger than I anticipated, clean and comfortable. Renovations are ongoing but didn't inconvenience me at all. There is no room safe or internet though. Staff spoke enough English to be helpful. Basically, a great deal for the money, Would absolutely stay again.

<Content>Great location for Barca break I stayed at Via Augusta as part of a 鈥楽tag Party鈥?for 9 people. It was a bonus to be able to have 3 people in a room as it allowed an equal split and worked out great for us.The hotel is situated only yards from Gracia metro station which is ideal as it allows easy access travel around the city. I found the metro to be very safe, clean, and cheap, and the best way to travel during my stay. There are a lot of local shops within walking distance of the hotel. I managed to buy lovely pastries for breakfast and the sweetest tasting fruit to eat while exploring the city.The hotel staff were extremely friendly  helpful, and the hotel rooms were cleaned to an impressive standard. The hotel itself was not particularly modern but is does look like it is in the process of been updated. The rooms were of an average size, clean and basic and the bathroom was of a good standard with plenty of hot water available. I have read the other reviews of this hotel complaining about noise from the road and traffic outside. There is a bit 鈥?but its not as bad as people have made out, it鈥檚 not going to keep you up all night.I would recommend the hotel and would stay there again 鈥?my bed my extremely comfortable indeed!

<Content>NIce place I recently travelled from Belfast to Barcelona to watch the Liverpool champions league match. We booked 3 rooms thru travel republic in the Via Augusta hotel. We travelled with jet2.com and landed at terminal A, on leaving the terminal building turn right and go across the bridge, this leads to the train station and it costs 2.50 euro per person to travel to Sants station, we took a taxi from Sants for 7.50 euro to the hotel. Although we later found it is only a matter of taking the green line metro to station Diagonal, then its about a 10 minute walk to hotel. The Via augusta was very clean, the staff were very friendly and very helpful, they all spoke good English. The rooms were what you would expect from a city hotel, I stayed in room 914, it had a nice balcony. Spotless bathroom. There was a little road noise in the mornings around 7.30 onwards, but very quite at night, the area the hotel is situated in is not very touristy and is a nice part of town. There are 2 small cafes down the street, the best one is called the Maria Christina. a few super markets are located up the street. The Ramblas area is 2 metro stops away, I would recommend checking the price of menus etc before you eat on the Ramblas. Fully recommend Barca as a city, friendly people.Oh yes the Nou camp can be reached by taking a Metro on the green line, get off at the Maria Christina metro station, it is a short walk away (5 mins).

<Content>OK for the money Stayed here for 2 nights in June. The bedroom wasn't amazing, was a bit worn and tired, but we were out all the time so didn't really care. We didn't find it noisy and thought the staff were helpful. It also appeared that the hotel is being renovated from the first floor up and from a peek into the new corridors it looks much snazzier - so perhaps one to remember next year!Great location - right in lovely Gracia, away from the tourist hoards, lovely bars and restaurants nearby. And a short walk to Passeig de Gracia and Diagonal. Plenty of buses and nearby tubes to get further afield.

<Content>Decent hotel....Good location This is a decent 'no thrills' hotel in a good location with easy links by foot or metro to all the main attractions. Our room was clean but small, our bed was a little uncomfortable but..hey your on holiday so what do you expect on a small budget. The breakfast is fine with all the basics that will set you up for the day.If i was planning a break in Barca again then i would certainly reconisider staying at the Via Augusta for short break.P.S. There is a handy small supermarket as you turn left from the hotel, first left again and twenty yards or so on your right hand side.Enjoy...

<Content>sleepless in barcelona After one night of not sleeping due to paper thin walls and a bathroom situated directly behind our headboard we were moved. The second room was no better and after a second night with little sleep and the following (our last) night being New Year's Eve (and thus even less sleep likely if that's possible) we brought our flight home forward and spent New Year at home. The corridors were ceramic tiled and so this didn't help either, neither did the inconsiderate and noisy guests either which I realise is not the hotel's fault but the walls really were ridiculously thin.

<Content>Average hotel in nice location The Via Augusta Hotel is in the Grazia district of Barcelona, directly next to Grazia station which is only two stops from Plaza Catalunya. That is, it is in walking distance of the Eixample area, if not the historical centre. The Grazia area is pleasant in itself.The hotel is located on a main street and therefore you might want to avoid rooms facing front. The hotel is narrow but high (10 storeys) and there is only one lift/elevator. The rooms are what you would expect from a 2 star hotel, nothing special, nothing awful. The staff do have the annoying habit of turning off the power in your room each day. You have to find the fuse switch (located above the light switch) to turn on the power. This was not easy to do in the dark.
