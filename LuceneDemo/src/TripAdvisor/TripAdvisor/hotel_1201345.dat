<Content>Perfect choice This is actually a 4 star boutique hotel, on the main street of Barcelona (La Ramblas). The location is excellent, the rooms are very modern and the staff very polite. Our whole experience was excellent and I would definitely recommend it!!

<Content>Love, Love love it !!!!!! 10/10 Myself and my boyfriend have just got back from Barcelona, we stayed at the Eurostars Ramblas Boquer铆a for 4nights from 4th-8th November and enjoyed every second!The HotelRooms:We had a standard double room and it was soooo nice, very modern, laminate floor, black white and red with silver touches, we had room 108 which is on the corner with a corner terrace balcony (big enough for at least 4 people to sit) that over looked the famous St. Joseph food market and the la Rambla but with NO NOISE! they have sound proofed the rooms so you don't hear anything with the french doors closed! Breakfast:We didn't have breakfast but you can either get it included when you book or its 12 euros per person per day but we didn't see the point as there is an entire market literally behind the hotel with a lovely patisserie and stalls with very nice fresh juices for 1 euro!Staff: Very friendly, we were greeted by 'Samuel' who after we had said we hadn't been to barcelona before got out a really useful map (only a throw away one but it proved to be a real help!) and talked about everything we should see/do including where the best view of the city are! Location: Doesn't get much better! you are right on the La Rambla and next to the Market the nearest tube stop is about 30sec over the road and provided great links to the areas a bit further out! you can buy a 10 journey pass for just over 7euros which is really good value and was perfect for our 4day stay i think we had one or two left in the end - the weather was so nice we walked most of the time anyway! your also only 5minutes from plaza catalunya which the the center of the city and you can get to everywhere from here, all full of shops, restaurants etc... the hotel it also only 10minutes walk to the port vall with some lovely views, shops restaurants etc..Transfers: you can get a taxi or train but we got the Aerobus from directly outside the airport, they come every 6minutes and take about 25-30 minutes to the center and for 4euro 5cents each its a bargain!I can't really say anything bad about this hotel everything about it was fantastic! our only comment for suggestions for improvements was that it would have been nice to have 1 or 2 english speaking channels on the TV just to you can keep up on the news etc as they are all spanish but other than that its all amazing! More like a 4 star than a 3! top marks! NB: if your a fan or Architecture/ Gaudi then the Casa Batlo is a must it was amazing!!  Hannah and Paul.
