<Content>Very romantic and quiet mansion This hotel is only so low in the rankings because it did not get many reviews yet. It is very delightful and more like staying in someone's home than in a hotel. The hotel can easily be reached by public transport from Central Station, by tram 2, getting off at the stop Valeriusplein, then walk through Emmalaan till just before the Vondelpark gate, then 100 meters to the left. The hotel has a very nicely decorated lounge with honesty bar and equally nice breakfast room with 9 tables. In nice weather one could take his plate outside to the wooden terrace overlooking a pond as it is right at the edge of the Vondelpark.This terrace is also a quite romantic place to sit in the evening. If you like a standard double room with view of that pond, take room 226, with bath and wide-screen TV. It is quite large enough, not big but has enough space and is quite romantic and with luxurious furniture and carpet..The whole hotel is NOT needing a renovation. It is in excellent condition. At the reception one can get an overview as to how it got a 4-star classification. I had a single, room 226, with a single bed under the sloping roof and just a shower, but quite cosy. It has a window with view of only trees, double.glazed, but the only noise one might hear otherwise is when it is a warm night and young people are staying outside in the park all night, which happens a lot in summer.There is a very silent airco, a TV with a sophisticated entertainment system, free TV channels and pay-TV and radio, as well as internet on TV (and a connection for own laptop).English TV channels are BBC 1 and 2 and World and news channels. Some 20 movies on pay.TV, cost 12 Euro for one for 24 hours, 4 Euro for a music piece and 12,50 Euro for internet, or 22,50 Euro for everything for 24 hours from moment of starting.The minibar contains soft drinks, beer and chocolate, all for 2 Euro an item. Also a coffee and tee machine (coffee pads system). At the reception one could ask for missing items suchas slippers, bath robe or toothpaste. Bath robe with hotel logo can be bought for 55 Euro. Nice toitletries in the bathroom, made for the Hampshire Hotels group. Taxi fare is 35 Euro to the airport at the reception.Breakfast is 12 Euro and well worth that money, a smallish English breakfast but filling enough.Hotel has rooms on 2 floors with an elevator.NIce people in the reception.This is a great little hotel as many very positive entries in the guest book also show.It is nice walk away from the museum area.The nicest was the feeing of being in a nature area but still close to Amsterdam centre. Thoroughly recommended.

<Content>very average Booked in at the Toro rather last minute. I'd echo those who say it's a way out of town - you need to get the Number 2 tram to EmmaLaan and walk about 5 minutes from there. The hotel itself is very average, despite the sign outside saying it is 4 star: myself I'd give it no more than 3-star. The decor is very dark and heavy, the rooms are obviously well used and are really rather faded and worn. The whole place could do with a refit. On the plus side it's a nice part of town and the walk through the Vondelpark is lovely in the morning. The bedding was clean, but they had obviously tried to squeeze a double into a room probably not suitable for more than a single. The area around the hotel was pretty quiet but for the workmen digging up a nearby road who started really early. Will not go back.

<Content>Little Gem Hotel Toro is off the beaten path, next to the Vondelpark. It was difficult for my taxi to find this beautiful, stately hotel. The rooms are fine, and importantly, there is an elevator to carry your bags upstairs.We arrived very early in the AM, having had strong jet stream winds to the east from the US. The man at the desk, Roy van Gelder, offered my wife and me a free breakfast (very adequate), as our room would not be ready for 3-4 hours. (So we walked to the tram, just 5 minutes, and went to Ann Frank's House....no crowds at 9AM).The hotel was clean, beds comfortable, and the surroundings anything but congested. It was silent at night! And the need to take a tram into town was no problem at all....actually fun! In another 5 minutes we were in the center of Amsterdam. I'd stay here again, as I don't like crowded, big, down-town locations while vacationing.

<Content>Quiet, but ? location This lovely hotel is very quiet and has pleasant views and access to Vondelpark. However, to get to the center of Amsterdam, it is necessary to take a tram, or walk a long distance. Taking the tram is easily done, but be sure to get tram tickets before getting to the hotel! We couldn't find a place to purchase them close by the hotel. Concierge was helpful in identifying restaurants in the area (I recommend the Italian restaurant Palma). For the price, I prefer to stay closer to the center of the city.

<Content>Comfortable and relaxing stayed here for two nights. It is in a beautiful quiet location which can be a rarity in Amsterdam! Its about 10 minutes on the tram from Dam Square etc.When you close the door of your room in Toro, you are completely away from the world. Rooms are so peaceful and comfy, it was a little refuge. Staff really helpful and I would defo stay here again

<Content>Classic Hotel in a calm place Hotel near Voldenpark in a street closed to vehicles. Very quiet. Classical mansion, with a rear garden overlooking a lake. Continental breakfast very complet. Tramway to downtown. But we rented two bycicles in central station: its much more pleasant and easy.
