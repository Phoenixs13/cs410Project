<Content>Decent value hotel We stayed in a triple room. There was enough space, and the bathroom was very clean.You can either have an ensuite room or share the communal bathroon. Having been in both, the communal matched the cleanliness of our room.The staff were helpful and the breakfast ,was OK to start a day sghtseeing. This hotel certainly meets the needs of most travellers.: cheap , coutreous and pleasant.The hotel is within walking distance of both U and S bahns

<Content>The loo stank I could not sleep the first night because the loo stank like crazy. Something wrong with the plumbing probably. I should have asked to change it but it was late and I was tired. They gave me a better smelling room next day but this was was next to the common loos and with the paper thin walls and noisy high pressure flush, I was awoken each time someone used it in the middle of the night. The staff were generally helpful, if harrassed. It's a busy hotel, but it's got, to use the lingo, soul.

<Content>Excellent value for money in single room Stayed recently for one night in a single room 44 Euro incl tax and brkfst, this was standard rate for a room without bathroom. Got an upgrade to a single room facing schluterstrasse with shower in the room. No street noise, spotless clean, thin walls (so better use earplugs if you are sensitive) and the best: the staff was extremely friendly and helpful (4 receptionists and breakfast staff), they made my stay to be a very pleasant experience. In my opinion a funny place (look at their website) and a recommendation if you are looking for a cheap, alternative in a great location. All bus stops and luxury good retailers just around the corner.

<Content>Basic but clean in great location There was a group of 8 of us stayed at the Bogota last weekend. The hotel was in a great location just off the Ku'damm, so ideal for lots of designer shops. It was a short walk to the central part of the Ku'damm and close to nearest underground and train stop. Buses also run along the Ku'damm to all other areas of Berlin.We stayed for 3 nights. We all had different style rooms. One of us was fortunate enough to get the one room in our party that had a shower in the room (it literally was in the room too). The other 4 rooms all had wash basins. However there wasn't a toilet in any of the rooms but there are several WCs on each floor and also several shower rooms. We didnt find this a problem and I do know that some of the rooms certainly do have en-suites. Our rooms were basic but clean and towels were changed daily. The beds were comfortable. The colour scheme is a bit bright (orange walls) but the public areas of the hotel are nicely decorated.  The staff seemed friendly enough at the reception area and you hand your key in whenever you leave so we could always go back to room whenever we needed to without the rest of group(I know another person identified a problem with keys). The desk is staffed all night and there aren't any restrictions on what time of night you return. Check-out is 12 noon.  Breakfast however was basic and the restaurant staff were extremely stressed and disorganised, one morning (saturday) they were finding it difficult dealing with quantity of guests and at one point there was no food left at the buffet. Expect cereal (cornflakes or muesli) cold meats and cheeses, bread and a boiled egg as breakfast menu. It was ok. Not sure if I would stay at this hotel again, it was great value for money considering location and at least there is a variety of rooms to suit different budgets.

<Content>Good on price and location The Bogota has a great location just of the Ku'damm in the Savigny Platz area and a good price on rooms. The public spaces of the hotel were very nice, the rooms adequate, and the beds comfortable. On the downside, there is no air-conditioning, the breakfast is mediocre at best, and the walls are extremely thin. In fact, our room was located on the courtyard side of the hotel, which you would have thought would have been quiet, but since there was no air-conditioning, everyone's windows were open and the noise echoed throughout the courtyard. Nevertheless, it was a decent homebase on the Ku'damm at a good price.

<Content>I have stayed in better This was an okay hotel. There is only a small lift. We got stuck in the elevator. Even though it says that it can fit 6 people, it can really only fit about 3. The rooms are fine. There are bathrooms in the room and they also have a public bathroom on each floor. The hotel offers a library where people can go and chat, which is nice. The room has a small tv, but everything is in German, except CNN. The only significant problem that I had was the fact that there was only one room key, so if you were not going to be with your roommate all day you had to delegate a way to handle the key. The hotel is also in a great location. It is on Kurfenstendam, which has lots of shops. Directly across from Bogota is Cartier and Gucci. So, if you love shopping, this is the hotel for you. Overall, I would say that this hotel was good for a European hotel.

<Content>Decent but not great The hotel is a few feet from one of Berlin's most beautiful streets, Kurfurstendamm, where there are lots of great shops, bars, and restaurants. As other reviewers have stated, the rooms at the Bogota are good sized, but the bathroom was a bit small. The shower head could not be properly adjusted to point the water spray in the right direction. The hotel is furnished with a quirky assortment of different furniture styles. A large shaft topped by a skylight in the center of the hotel adds light; they also play Gregorian chants that echo in the shaft for a strange but pleasant effect. The staff were mostly friendly and helpful, but the sole gentleman who worked the desk always seemed a bit put out about having to be there. The breakfast buffet of cold cuts, bread, yogurt, and fruit was basic but good. We payed 98 Euros per night (about $120). If we're in Berlin again we'll try another place.

<Content>Disappointement We spent the bank holiday at Bogota and whilst its location is great, we were thoroughly dissappointed with the staff and service we received. We arrived a day late as we missed our flight (due to circumstances beyond our control) and despite explaining our horrendous journey and the detour we had to take to the management, they insisted we pay for the room we had not used! One would have expected a more sympathetic response! Furthermore, whilst rooms are large, the bathroom/showers are like little holes attached to the room with very little space and very basic amenities. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Disliked this place Despite this great location, rooms were quite spartan , down the hall WC, was unacceptable. You either froze or burned yourself in the shower!Included breakfasts - awful. Why bother?Personnel nice, though.

<Content>Clean and friendly hotel in great location. This is a friendly hotel in a great location, just of the Kurf眉rstendamm. Though the rooms aren't exactly state of the art, our room was well maintained and clean. What the hotel lacks in corporate comfort, it makes up for in quirky and historic details though! These include large hallways on each floor, the fourth floor hallway containing photographs taken by the fashion photographer Yva in the 20/30's. Our room faced the front, which meant it gave us nice views but there was a lot of road noise with the window open. The staff were all friendly, professional and ready to help. Considering the location, this hotel offers good value for money. I would certainly consider staying here again.
