<Content>Near the airport I stayed alone in this hotel last August. Before flying out I did the usual of looking up hotels and reading the reviews but it's always difficult to make a decision! As I travel alone regularly I tend to go to hotels where there are fewer rooms as it makes me feel safer.This hotel is near the airport and I can see that it would definately suit business people as opposed to young travellers as it is probably too quiet. However the train station is only a 10 minute walk away.The room was clean and the staff were friendly....other than that the hotel was ok.There is an Italian restaurant attached to this hotel where the food was ok and the sevice was good. I tended to eat out in Berlin and come back and sit on the terrace to enjoy a few beers.This is a good hotel to stay in if you don't want to be in the hustle and bustle of the city or if you want to be close to the airport.

<Content>Close to the Airport but also to a busy rail line This hotel is about 10 minutes walk from Schoenfeld Airport and 5 minutes from the S-bahn station. Although I only stayed there 1 night, I found it clean and efficient although possibly lacking in charm and cosiness. The room I was given was very comfortable and well furnished, but there was no air conditioning, which could be a problem during the summer as the hotel is right next to a busy rail line which you can't ignore if the windows are open !There is a restaurant next door and a filling station with a shop just up the road, but very little else of interest (the area seemed to be mainly business, rather than residential).If you need to catch an early morning flight or will be flying into Schoenfeld late in the evening, then the Albergo is ideal for an overnight stay. However for longer stays you could probably find something better located in central Berlin.

<Content>Great value We stayed 3 nights. Rooms are clean, bright and in 1800麓s decor. The buffet breakfast very good. Attention by hotel staff to us was great. Location was less than one block from the U - uderground. At a price of $100 per night per double it was a great value. Try it. Bob

<Content>Two-star at best; you can do much better than this one. We stayed a week so this is not based on just a few days.over-priced, far from everything, breakfast included but you better get there at 7 a.m. if you want some luke-warm eggs and sausages: they're gone by 8 and they don't replace most of the items that run out early, like croissants, a few pieces of fruit, etc. but there's cold-cuts and juice and cereal  yogurt  breads; great home-made wholegrain bread. Oh, and the coolest automatic coffee machine ever!! Has snotty morning/daytime receptionist but nice one late-afternoon and evenings; small noisy rooms, NO A/C !! bad mattresses, tiny shower but effective; no electric outlet in bathroom for hairdryer or shaver or whatever; no reading lights, tiny t.v. set, windows open just a crack so you'd better hope for cool weather if you're here in summer. But: free wireless LAN, free bathrobe, and LOTS of red, satiny drapes, pillows, bedcovers etc to simulate an Italian decorated hotel. Beautiful from the outside, well-worn on the inside.The general area is pleasant enough, but in the evening, no inexpensive restaurants nearby: only a snack grill (Doener sandwiches from Turkey, and hamburgers). There's a nice little supermarket 3 blocks away, though. And during the day (if you're hanging around your hotel instead of being out in the city doing tourist stuff) there are some small restaurants and bakeries, etc. in the area, and especially down in the U-Bahn below street-level.U-Bahn : to get to ANY of the attractions you'll need to transfer at least once, usually twice.If a small red canopy over your bed and heavy red curtains, etc. is REALLY important to you, you may like this place, but I'd say pass on this one; there's much better hotels in the 100-dollar per night range.Like I said, we spent a week, and it was no-where near as good a value as our week in Munich was. Far from it.

<Content>Very convenient hotel, no complaints I booked into the Albergo Berlin because I was a woman alone arriving on a late flight to Berlin Shoenefeld airport. All you have to do is just walk out to the main street in front of the airport, walk to the left for about 5 minutes and you are there. I got a very good rate on booking.com. The desk staff were lovely and helpful, the room was immaculately clean, and the breakfast buffet was great, as were the dining room staff. The rail station is opposite the airport so It is very simple to travel into the centre of Berlin, either by train or metro. On the train, you can reach Alexanderplatz in about 20 minutes, about 10 minutes longer to Zoologischer Garten. The metro may be quicker if one is pressed for time, but the train is a very enjoyable ride - clean, comfortable and uncrowded.

<Content>Dirty Albergo A 4 star hotel with a 1 star attitude. The room was dirty, with dirty floors and very dusty at higher levels. I wrote my name in the dust on the television in room 403 and added the date, I wonder how long it will be there! It cost us 9.40 euro for 2 x 75cl bottles of water. Breakfast was poor ,one you coukld associate with a low starred hotel. The waiting staff and the cleaning staff were functional whilst a good point was the reception staff who were very helpful. On arrival we were allowed to put our cases in the room which was not ready. However, we had noticed that the pillow cases needed changing as they were stained. When we came back that evening the room was made up and it was not until the following morning that we realised the pillow cases were the stained ones. We were allocated 1 bath towel and 2 hand towels and on our request this was changed but we ended up with 2 bath towels and 1 hand towel. The toilet seat was cracked underneath and the fitting was loose, the shower leaked onto the floor as the shower door did not fit correctly.

<Content>Albergo go go! I stayed here twice, on my way to and from Wolsztyn to drive steam trains. [That holiday was unbelievably brilliant, marred only by the dishonesty of the american travel agent, Rannoch and Howard Jones. You have no choice but to book through the latter as he has things all tied up with PKP (Polish Railways). My complaint including evidence and witnesses was ignored.See my review of the Wolsztyn Experience.]The Albergo was excellent apart from a language problem when I requested a cooked breakfast. This hotel could not be more convenient for Schoenefeld Airport and the Bahn. Food was good, staff were pleasant if very limited in use of English which made me use my schoolboy German, which was not a great help. Would definitely go again!

<Content>Good for one night! If you know where this hotel is and don't have much luggage you can very easily walk to it from the airport. I didn't know how far it was and so took a taxi which cost 4euro and did not endear me to the driver. I arrived late (22:45) but the receptionist was friendly and helpful. The room was small, basically furnished and scruffy. It was also VERY hot which forced me to open the windows. After five minutes I found out how close it is to the S-Bahn line (VERY!). In spite of that i managed to sleep with the windows open even though there were trains all night.Breakfast was in a seperate building but only 30 seconds walk from reception. it was a typical German style buffet and very good indeed. Service was efficient and friendly. For the price and proximity to the airport I think this is excellent value for a one night stay. The only thing that let it down was the scruffiness of the rooms, they could do with re-decorating.

<Content>Terrible hotel, but Close to Schonefeld airport We decided to stay at this (nominally 4*) hotel because it was close to Schonefeld Airport. Well, it was close, but awful. Definitely not 4*, Rooms, are old, ugly and look dirty. Never received a paint in 10 years. Cost us 85 Euros

<Content>Having a morning flight from Sch枚nenfeldt- Stay at this one Not situatied in the most interesting part in Berlin, but if you want to avoid S-bahn early in the morning to go to the airport, this hotel can me very practical.Got a very discounted rate from the web (鈧?5) and for a single room I think that is very good in a four star hotel. Staff were friendly and efficent and the sauna is nice.The hotel also has a free shuttle service to the airport. Just sign up for it the day before. Will stay here again if I am having a morning flight from Sch枚nenfeldt.

<Content>Dont mention the war Arriving at the Hotel Albergo should have been easy. However a combination of two Reception staff with obvious personality bypasses and the fact that they did not seem to accept the computer Confirmation print-out as a booking hardly helped my opinion.After solving that, I went upto my hotel room. It was superbly clean,quite roomy (It was only me in the room!) The bathroom was white,functional and again spotless. Only complaint really is that the room was facing directly towards the main S-bahn line. However, double glazing soon solved that.Restaurant meals were lovely,well cooked and the staff I always found helpful. You were able to eat at the restaurant if you were a non-resident. It was Italian cookery which made a nice change from the norm.Hotel is only 500metres away from S-bahn Schonefeld which also links up with the airport (a short distance away). It only takes 15minutes to get into the city centre.Beware of the gym there were only 1 weights machine, one cycle, and a shoulder press when I was there! Also you have to pay for the sauna, a sum which was not mentioned when I booked online.Apart from that and the occasional sullen Reception staff I had a good stay.PS There is a live disco in the restaurant on a Saturday night which played Jive Bunny when I was there.....least said the better!!
