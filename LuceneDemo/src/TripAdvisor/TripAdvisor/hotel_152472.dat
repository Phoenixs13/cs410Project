<Content>Do not recommend this hotel I booked Hotel de Cortes as I wanted to stay in a historical hotel.My plan was to write about it in a travel article. First of all, we were not greeted in a friendly way except for the concierge, Fernando.We looked at about 5 rooms before choosing room #202. It had a sitting room and a bedroom which had a balcony facing the busy street. At this point, it was the best of the lot.The rooms looked trodden and rundown but clean. The price was to be $140 but we were able to finally get it for $120. I feel that this hotel would be reasonably priced at $50 per night. The night manager kept changing prices and availabilites. It looked lifeless as if no one was in the hotel but us.Fernando, the concierge was very helpful. Isador, the ex manager was friendly and alive!The day manager was abrupt at first but mellowed a bit when the ex manager was so positive towards our efforts with Spanish.We had to keep confirming in the morning that we had a buffet with our room price. On the second day, the manager put a price for our buffet even though the day before he had approved it.When we checked out, the day manager added all kinds of extra prices...CHECK YOUr Bill...We had about five errors in ours.Fernando offered trips but they were so expensive!When we got a taxi provided by the hotel, we were ripped off....a 10 minute ride to the bus station for $15.The morning buffet was to us, inedible except for fruitloop cereals.We just had a bad feeling about the staff and hotel...always feeling ripped off.I would not recommend this hotel at all.

<Content>Extreme Disappointment With what I had read, and with the history and location of the hotel, I had high expectations. They were dashed. We had to try four different rooms to find one that was even reasonably private and quiet and that had all of its amenities working. Even with that, we had bugs in the bathroom and courtyard staff noise early in the morning (e.g., starting around 7:00 a.m.). We had one meal in the restaurant, which was mediocre. The one computer in the lobby worked slowly or not at all. But what was by far the worst about the hotel was the concierge staff. All but one was rude or lacking in knowledge or dishonest. For example, one tried to overcharge us for a tour to Teotiuacan (and laughed when we caught him). We accepted a restaurant recommendation from another, only to learn that, despite his promise of a seat in the non-smoking section, the restaurant had no non-smoking section. And when it came to directions, the staff either didn't know or, worse, gave wrong directions. We do not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Don't accept the first rooms they show you! Although the price was OK ($95) we had to look at practically all the rooms before getting two very nice large rooms. Most of the rooms have no windows and face a dark inner courtyard. We had two rooms - first (110) on the ground floor with non-opening windows - which was quite warm. Otherwise, it was quite nice, with a modern bathroom and large towels. The second room (206) was a mini-suite, also without opening windows. This room was rather cold. A fair amount of street noise, but not enough to prevent us from sleeping on the comfortable, firm mattress. Rooms opening onto courtyard would probably have been quieter, although darker.No hot water in the evening, although plenty at night. Inexcusable in this price range. Staff pleasant although not particularly knowledgeable. Couldn't recommend local restaurant for a quick bite on Saturday night. Weren't sure where some of local attractions were located.Convenient location, near metro station and pleasant park. Easy to walk to Zocalo.

<Content>First Hotel Of Mexico If You're lucky enough to be in Mexico City, than you should be lucky enough to stay at the first hotel ever built in Mexico City. Originally a SanFransiscan Monastery, monks would stop here before going to their mission. This hotel still withholds the tradition of providing solitary peace and comfort even in one of the largest cities in the world. The rooms are built of 2 foot thick stone walls, there are great works of art throughout the lobby and the hallways. You can see that the management of this hotel really cares a great deal about making this the best hotel they can. This is actually one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and I usually demand a pool. When I left it looked as though they were putting in a excersize room. The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. Every meal is perfectly prepared. There are cooks who will make omelette for you in the morning and tacos for you at lunch. The restaurant in the courtyard is a buffet style and there is plenty of selection. Don't be afraid of the food, eat as much as you can, you'll come home trying to recreate it. It won't happen. Eating in the courtyard is also an activity in itself. It was one of the highlights of my trip. I enjoyed listening to the many species of caged birds singing as well as the many churchbells ring. The location is priceless, walking distance to most of the finest attractions in the city. A lot of venders in the park right across the street.. Try the japanese peanuts, they're amazing! There is also a tour bus that stops at the museum half a block from the entrance. I highly recommend going on this tour. It's inexpensive and 3 hours. You can also get off at any stop and the next bus will be by in 20 minutes. If you wish to take a taxi, request one from the front desk. They arranged one for us to the pyramids. Our driver spoke english, and also was an archeological guide which really makes you feel like you're on pilot guides. By far, if you don't want to spend a lot of money and you want to get the best value go with this one.

<Content>not recommended yes, this is great old building. but the rooms and bathrooms are at the level of a hotel costing 25$ in mexico and the staff is horribly rude. there is no functioning gym, dont be fooled. to get any air, you have to open a window with no screen, so you will be attacked by mosquitoes. again, the room itself is tiny and ugly and the bathroom broken down. this is not the greatest neighborhood unless you know mexico city well. if you want a historic hotel, try better quality option such as the former convent in oaxaca or the los juaninos in morelia. avoid this place!

<Content>Experience True Mexico-Hotel Cortez Great, intimate lodging. If you want to experience the true flavor of Mexico and enjoy walking, this is a wonderful place to stay. Yes, the rooms were modest, but they were very clean, lots of hot water (good water pressure) and the service was excellent. Also, the food here is excellent and moderately priced. Many local residents dine at this hotel. Fifteen minute walk to the Zocalo, with many wonderful sights to see on your walk there. The Alameda and Central Historical Districts were definitely save areas to walk in. Hotel provided excellent travel advice and have a fleet of taxis available for guests. The sounds from the the central patio area are generally pleasant (water fountain and singing birds), but admittingly, the Friday night show could be a bit loud. I suggest that you make plans to be out on Friday night or have a couple of cervezas and join in the fun. If you are looking for a pleasant, moderately priced hotel, this place is for you. If you need the stale, high priced, glass and steel structures (like you have at home) go north up the Reforma.

<Content>Beautiful hotel; great for art lovers!! We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Cortes. It is a beautiful colonial building with a great courtyard. The rooms were clean and as a former hermitage, appropriately furnished in a simple fashion. No frills, but definetly comfortable. The staff was excptionally friendly and informative. Its not in the safest neighborhood, (like most of mexico city) but the staff was very helpful in arranging reliable roundtrip transportation from the front door of the hotel. The Hotel Cortes is in a great location, walking distance (15 min) to the Zocalo, Cathedral, and the main temple ruins, 3 blocks from the Bellas Artes and is across the street from the Alameda and 1 block from the museum which houses one of Diego Riveras greatest Murals (Dream of A Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda). Numerous other museums and points of interest near by. The Metro station is on the corner and will take you anywhere you need to go.It is a bit loud from the restaurant setup in the courtyard, but there is so much to see that you will appreciate the wakeup call. Not to mention, the food served is pretty good, and pretty busy during lunch and dinner from locals.

<Content>Terribly noisy and not a good location for women Just returned from Mexico City and loved everything but the hotel. Great looking place but on Friday nights they have a 3 hour music and dance revue in the courtyard. Deafening music and dancing and no escape as all rooms connect to the courtyard. Neighborhood has no restaurants or bars for blocks. At night this is a problem. Very little water pressure, small room, smoky bar..... I would not stay here again.

<Content>Deserves a better rating! What a nice little hotel! I've wanted to stay here since it was featured on The Amazing Race 3, so booked a night prior to a weekend trip to Taxco. Wanting to try different hotels, I booked the cushier Sheraton Centro Historico for my return after Taxco.Met the owner Santiago Brockmann, who was extremely knowledgeable about art and travel and made several excellent museum recommendations. The computers were down when I checked in - luckily - because the standard room I had paid for was not yet cleaned, so they put me in another room they knew was definitely available - one of the newly renovated executive suites. The suites are twice the size of the regular rooms and on the ground floor. If you're noise sensitive or want to sleep late, this isnt the best option because they start to set up breakfast at about 630am and you hear it all... But, if you need something to force you out of bed to go sightseeing, this is perfect. All the rooms face the beautiful courtyard - and it was actually cool in the morning (compared to the AC equipped Sheraton Centro). Good TV options - CNN, BBC and a German news channel in English. They had only the good FOX, not news.When I decided there was too much to see in Mexico City and cancelled Taxco, I debated moving to the cushier Sheraton right away, but the Cortes was so nice, I stayed another night. I got a $77 business travelers rate by comparing prices on this site.

<Content>Interesting Experience If you like staying in historic buildings, you will like this place. The location is good, the ambience is unique, and the price was $85 including tax when we stayed there in February, 2005. Some rooms are quieter and more cheerful than others. Housekeeping may not be as good as it should be (we found a wristwatch the former tenant left behind). Also, when we reported that our TV wasn't working properly, we were given the run-around and I had to sit in the office until management relented and called a handyman who eventually brought us a working TV.

<Content>Very nice hotel in the centre of Mexico City Lovely historic hotel within walking distance of the Zocalo and historic city centre sights. The Turibus (open top bus which takes you on a circular tour of the city) stops within 100 yards of the hotel entrance, very useful for visiting the anthropological museum without relying on taxis.The rooms are situated around a courtyard restaurant which serves food from breakfast to about 11 at night. Lots of businesss type people eat here during the day - so don't expect any afternoon naps!The food in the restaurant is good and reasonably priced.The rooms are quite small and overlook the courtyard, we stayed in both ground floor and first floor rooms, I would recommend staying on the first floor as the ground floor rooms can be a bit claustrophobic.

<Content>A wonderful experience. This is a romantic, colonial hotel, complete with a courtyard with a fountain and full of flowers. It is also very reasonable (around US$72 per night). The staff was very attentive. We stayed for 2 days and our only complaint was that the bed was very hard.. We'd definetely stay again.
