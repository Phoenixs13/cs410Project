<Content>Cheap and not very cheerful Only avoids a terrible rating because this is a really cheap hotel, so it must be viewed in that context. Really basic room, pillows so thin they could double up as towels, tiny tiny bathroom with a soap dispenser but no shampoo, soap bars, shower gel etc., and tiny, threadbare towels. Basic breakfast buffet, where I was told (not asked, told) to use the coffee pot left behind by the previous person on my table, as there was still some left ! The buffet itself was barely tolerable, and the plates for the hot buffet were side plates, not dinner plates, so you were not exactly encouraged to tuck in. Took 15 minutes to get a drink at the bar, mainly because the barman couldn't change a 5 euro note.No air conditioning in the tiny bedroom made for a really bad night's sleep. Avoid like the plague if staying for leisure, because there is nothing enjoyable about this hotel. Not suitable for business visitors unless on a really tight budget.

<Content>Good for 1 night Stayed there one night because I missed my connection to Erfurt. Has a free airport shuttle, and free breakfast, which was quite good. Offers wireless Internet for a fee but only in the lobby and on the first floor. Post is an older hotel with bit outdated decor. Rooms are big and my bed was very comfortable so that's all that mattered. Restaurant closed pretty early so make sure you eat before hand because there is nothing near by to get food. It is way outside of the city so it is not a hotel one would want to stay if visiting Frankfurt for longer periods of time.
