<Content>What Value for the Price What a hotel! What a family! What a wonderful experience. We arrived and were immediately greeted by Hannake, the daughter running the hotel. She gave us many suggestions of wonderful things to do in Amsterdam and was extremely friendly. Mary, her mother, served homemade bread and pancakes for breakfast with the most wonderful spread of food I've ever seen in europen hotels (with cold milk for all Americans not used to the warm milk idea) Be warned, they aren't kidding when they say the spiral stair case creates problems. It's very difficult to get your luggage up the stairs if you haven't packed light. However, the view, the staff and the price really sold this hotel as one of my favorites. Would definately return!

<Content>Dutch Treat We went on our honeymoon last year (September 2007) and felt it was necessary to write a review. Better late than never...What can I say other than what a wonderful experience. For all the guest complaining about warm orange juice, moquitoes I feel that you need to spend the money and stay in a five star palace. People always want the most value for their money and this is the place for an inexpensive (by Amsterdam standards) authentic Dutch experience. Food, service, cleanliness and location was impeccable.The hot breakfast was more than adequete and kept us fueled until later that day. To spend money on breakfast in Amsterdam with what you recieve you would be paying up toward 20 euros per person. Give this place a chance if you want to stay in a canal house in the heart of Amsterdam with wonderful breakfast, comfortable rooms and a true BB experience. We loved it and I hope you will too

<Content>Perfectly Dutch We found Hotel Keizershof in the Rick Steves guidebook, and based on his review (and the reviews on this site) we gave it a shot. A word up front (something to be aware of): this is a cash only establishment. Fortunately it is inexpensive enough that this isn't a problem.It is a family run hotel (more of a BB, really), and everyone is friendly, kind, and courteous. The room was clean and spacious and the view of the city was pleasant. We stayed for more than five days, so we were given a discount on the room of (two bedroom en suite dropped from 115 euro a night to 100 euro a night). The breakfasts included fresh fruit, bread, and cheese, and a very tasty omelette each morning. It is conveniently located next to a tram line (fourth stop from Centraal on the 16, 24, 25 trams) and a block from a grocery store. It is a 10 to 15 minute walk from the Rijksmusem and the Van Gogh Museum, and 5 to 10 minutes from the Leidesplein. When I travel to Amsterdam in the future I will be sure to stay in the Hotel Keizershof

<Content>Not the experience or hospitality that is advertised or was expected. We were very excited when we found the review and information on the hotel. It sounded very historic, in a good location and that people enjoyed staying there b/c of the great breakfast and great hospitality. Unfortunately, this was not our experience at all. My boyfriend and I were travelling Europe, it was his first time, my upteenth..or so. The hotel was as expected. We were warned about the stairs and the travel up, so i did't expect to have any help or warning with that, but the stairs are very narrow and steep, so travel light, or be ready for a strong work out. The rooms were simple, but clean. Our problem was upon our arrival. The problems started when we first came to hotel - we had told them we would be there at about 10 am after getting through customs, etc and getting a ride from the airport. This was our first stop on our trip as well, so we were very jetlagged and tired. When she answered the door, it was as if we were putting her out, she did not seem happy to see us and told us our room was not ready (even though my email confirmation said it would be upon us coming at 10am). She said it woudl be ready in an hour and we were fine with that and did a quick tour at the Anne Frank House. We came back and took a nap. When we left that nite, i just happened to notice that the room said it was 100 Euro a nite, instead of the 80 we were promised in the email i had. I brought this up to the lady and she said 'oh you are in teh wrong room, we will have to switch you tomorrow'. i asked her why we could not switch thena nd she said our room was taken. i said well i am not goign to pay full price and she said yes you are b/c you just told me....it was still the same day and i did not think this was fair. Then we made the mistake of asking her where the 'bull dog' is. we were told it was a good place to go eat and instead it is actually a 'coffee shop'. we did not know this and she started to yell at me saying there is no smokin in the hotel and that is a place to get Marijuana. i assured her that we were not there to do drugs and just were told it was a place to eat and if she had a better palce in mind. she just said 'just go in that direction and you find something'. not very friendly or the kind of advice we were expecting. the next morning we came down for breakfast but were told our other room was not ready, so we needed to take a nap and told her we were goign to do this and her maid siad to just let her know when we were ready to change rooms later and would do this. we took a nap until 2 or so and went down and she said we could no longer exchanage rooms. i asked why and she started to yell at me again saying that her maid was gone and could not switch us. i said we can move our own luggage, etc, and she said that she was not going to do it and started to falsely accuse us of things we were doing in Amsterdam that she did not approve of and that we were goign to give her a heart attack with all our arguing with her. I simply did not say anythign to her!!! i told her it was not our fault for being put in the wrong room after her tantrum, and were not goign to pay full price and we agreed to pay in the middle. we were never offered anything extra at teh breakfast buffet, and when i went down the next morning without my boyfriend, she asked where he was and i said he has jet lag and she said 'yeah, amongst other things'. I was offended that again she was making assumptions and she just slammed my silverware and plates down in front of me and i asked for coffee andshe never brought it, but instead told us to pay her. She was a very rude hostess, not welcoming, and we also had to ask her five times to get us a cab for the airport. We felt like we were staying at our grandmother's house. We are in our mid 30's, not teegagers or partiers. we came to see the sights and did not feel like returning to the hotel except to sleep. buyer beware here, i have never been treated so rudely.

<Content>Lovely I stayed here with my cousin in March of last year. It was great, I think we had the Rita Hayworth room. It was at the back of the house with our own staircase, we had a toilet upstairs and a private shower/toilet downstairs. The room was huge with a great bed and a huge dresser. We aren't exactly the lightest of packers and we were able to spread out all 4 huge suitcases on the floor easily! The breakfast was excellent, we were the only ones at the table one morning and the owner made us omelets with produce from her garden! There is a great restaurant a few blocks to the left (your back facing the hotel), go early and get the price fix menu.

<Content>Very Dutch and Very Friendly We stayed here as a family of 5 - mom, dad, 2 teenage age girls and a 12 year old girl. In short, we loved it. It was very much a BB experience, with Mary alsways there to answer questions or make suggestions.The climb up the twisting staircase to our rooms in the 16th century canal building was so much more memorbale than a high speed elevator ride would have been. We had a view of their charming courtyard from our room. And it was a pleasure to sit in that courtyard and talk with the owners - Mary and her daughter Annika (sp?).The rooms were spacious and clean. Breaksfast was lovely. and the location on a quiet canal was perfect.I would highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a unique experience. We are going back this summer and we're psyched!

<Content>Nice B Let me start by saying that the Hotel Keizershof has large, lovely, clean rooms with great views, is in a prime location, and serves a wonderful breakfast. Would I stay here again? Yes. Was it without problems? No.You need to know right off the bat that this is not a hotel, no matter what they call it. This is a BB. Don't expect a front desk with services; you're staying in someone's home with no phones and family members milling around. That's fine, but they do represent themselves as a hotel, and it's just not true. Yes, they do have a lounge with a t.v., but we were never invited to use it; usually the owner's daughter was playing in front of it and watching cartoons while we ate breakfast 5 feet away. Also, forget the 4 rooms and 65 euro that you will see advertised elsewhere. They now have, as far as I can tell, between 8-10 rooms, and no room goes for less than 90 euros, even in the off season. Also, be aware that the fact that you are in an old house means thin walls and very creaky floors. Ask for a room on the very top floor to avoid the noise.On the up side, the breakfast was wonderful, the rooms are quite clean and definitely huge, the views are great, the family is eccentric but friendly. If you like the European BB experience, definitely stay here. If you need hotel amenities, try somewhere else.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This small hotel is very quaint and perfectly located. There is just something about sleeping in a canal house that was built in the 1640's! Mary and her daughter are excellent hosts. Our Rita Hayworth room was very clean and the breakfast each morning was great. The hotel has a definite BB feel- it was fun eating at the breakfast table with the other guests talking about our Amsterdam experiences. Mary was particularly helpful, waiting up for us when we got lost while driving from Paris to Amsterdam and even arranging a taxi pick up for us. Amsterdam is a wonderful city- be adventurous! People in the service industry (hotels, etc.) will advise you not to rent bikes and will try to convince you that you will be run over, however, it is the ONLY way to see the city!

<Content>Worth the Trip! A great little BB at a convenient location on one of the main grachts in central Amsterdam. Easily accessible to Rembrandtsplein  Leidseplein w/ the Spui Centre and the Reijksmuseum a short walk too. There's a train stop right near the Hotel as well. Street parking in front was readily available, but expensive. Proprietors are very knowledgeable of the area and quick to offer suggestions on sights  restaurants.In typical European style, rooms tend towards the smaller side, but not uncomfortably small. Prepare yourself for bringing luggage up a tight, steep corkscrew staircase. Rooms facing the rear have a view of a peaceful garden courtyard (read: very quiet at night). Last: the breakfasts are great -- don't miss the omelettes.

<Content>Had a very good time Hosts were pleasant, and gave excellent touring advice concerning both Amsterdam and the Hague. Breakfast was quite good, and they even gave us a small bottle of wine for the evening. The stairs were quite steep, but that is simply the nature of canal houses. We had the Marlene Dietrich room -- The room was very comfortable and well-maintained.

<Content>Not a good experience This hotel was not worth the money (105 euro) that we paid for it, especially in the off-season when so much more is available! We were greeted rudely by the hostess, because we were 1 1/2 later than we had expected (we arrived at 6:30 p.m.) The hallway, stairway and room were dingy and not cosy at all. The window in the room was cracked, there was no shower door on the shower; the double bed was two twins; one of the bedlights was out; things were dusty. It's much more of an OK-one star hotel than someone's home. I would advise everyone: don't come here, you can easily do better.

<Content>Delightful, Cozy Hotel We stayed a week in the Keizerhof Hotel in late April 2004 and had a truly marvelous time!!! We stayed in the Marlene Dietrich room, which had a beautiful view of the family garden below us. The DeVries family, which ran the hotel, were very warm, inviting, and accomodating. The location of the hotel is very convenient (along a canal) to the center of Amsterdam. The very modest price which they charge for the room is well worth it. We would highly recommend it. We intend to come back to this hotel next year.

<Content>Charming hotel A charming family run hotel. Well located on one of the main grachts just a short walk from Rembrandtsplein, Leidseplein and Reijksmuseum. Rather steep stairs to the rooms which are each named after film stars: John Wayne, Charlie Chaplin, Rita Hayworth etc. Excellent breakfast served in the family living room or garden (weather permitting). You are assured of a truly warm, Dutch welcome. My first choice every time.
