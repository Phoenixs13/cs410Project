<Content>Great hotel Lindemann麓s is clean, modern, well-decorated, comfortable, and offers great service. The only drawback is the location; it麓s easy to get to the center and all the sights by metro, but it麓s a bit of a walk if you want to go on foot. Still, the neighborhood is fine (residential) and a couple of metro tickets is a very small price to pay in exchange for the value and quality of the hotel.

<Content>Terrific Value. Modern Hotel. We chose this hotel based on the price and the few reviews available, which were favorable. The location is fairly close to a few metro routes. We found ourselves using the U2 most, which was about 4 blocks away. The neighborhood is not built for tourists. We did find a couple of good resturants and bars nearby. It just takes a little exploring.The room was sleek, in all black and white, with a walk-in slate shower. Its all very new, although it had an Ikea feel to it. Quite spacious and comforatable. I would have liked a second chair in the room, so that one of us didn't have to sit on the bed or the floor.Be careful when booking online. When I selected the rate with breakfast included, it calculated 'extra person fees' and taxes that amounted to $144 for our 4 night stay. We decided to skip breakfast, but the buffet looked nice and is available for 11 Euro/person.Overall, great value at $55/night!

<Content>Great hotel When I read reviews I always wonder how like myself the writers are so: we are a husband, wife and four-year old: middle-aged professionals. We travel mainly to England, Florida and the Caribeaan. We loved this hotel. A fantastic value. Very close to everything and the staff were super helpful printing off maps and explaining the subway system. They were also great with our sometimes jet-lagged grumpy son. We enjoyed the breakfast--the coffee is fantastic. After reading other reviews we took our own soap, shampoo etc. but there was a dispenser in the shower we could have used. They do not provide face cloths (flannels for the British). We are completely techonologically challenged but after a few tries did not have too much difficulty with the door handles--maybe they have changed them. It was very clean, we felt very safe. They provided a roll out bed for our son. Beautiful bathroom in black slate. The room was not huge but perfectly adequate. No coffeemaker or fridge. TV got CCN and BBC news. No english kid shows. There was a hairdryer. We only ate breakfast there. I think they only offer snacks at other times but I did see another guest ordering in--the front desk has menus from local restaurants. The hotel gave us coupons for 5 euros off our breakfast each day on the one day we did not eat breakfast they took the 5 off our room bill.The alsatian restaurant recommeded by a previous traveller was great. The italian restuarant rec. by the hotel staff is fantastic. We also loved hundert biers restaurant. If travelling with children: we did not find many places that offered a children's menu or the toys/colouring pages we are used to in Canada--we took our own. Our son loved Lego land (I did,. too). Kindercity is similar to Toronto's Science Ctr. Kidspark--but not as good--and is mostly in german, so if you only speak English may not be a good deal. All the workshops: chocolate, cars etc etc are extra $, only in german and for 6yrs and up. He loved the rides at the Christmas markets. We are not big shoppers but we loved the atmosphere of the markets.We loved the story of Berlin museum, the Dom, the old masters art gallery. Were a bit disappointed with the zoo--prefer Toronto's.

<Content>Spotless and modern The distance from the hotel is about 8 miles but through the traffic takes roughly 20 mins. A taxi will cost around 20 euros and the hotel is well known so there will be no problem in finding it. The hotel itself is situated on a main road, if your room is facing the road you will have a brilliant view of the hussle and bustle of daily life, although the drug drop in centre opposite is a bit seedy looking. There are plenty of shops in the immediate area including a lidl.There wasnt much street noise considering the volume of traffic through the night, there is a thick black curtain which covers the massive window that gives uninteruppted sleep. The rooms themselves are modern- black and white - beautiful really, the shower (big enough for a football team) and toilet all black slate tilesThe rooms are changed daily and the staff are always courteous and wish you a pleasant day.The only down point for me with the hotel and its a minor quibble and thats the room door mechanism - the door can be a nightmare to open, you have to press a button, pass the card pass it wait for a green light,turn handle and hopefully enter - Good luck trying it when you have had a few.When you first exit lindemanns dont go left - theres not a lot there, the main points are all easily reached going right.Word of warning - after dark you will encounter prostitutes on the rroute back to the hotel. They loiter around the bridge 200m away in shorts and long boots - theyre no bother but some may find intimidating.Lindemanns overall is faultless though..

<Content>This was perfect for our stay We spent 3 nights here for the Xmas markets and we couldn't fault the place.The rooms were stylish, clean and the beds very comfortable. We were on the front of the hotel on the 4th floor and we weren't affected by traffic noise as mentioned in a previous review.The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and the price was brilliant value. We didn't have breakfast but we did make use of the bar after a long day sightseeing....The immediate vicinity isn't brilliant for bars and restaurants, but this isn't an issue because Berlin has one of the best transport systems going and there is a bus stop directly outside the hotel. Buses from here will take you directly to the Brandenburg Gate in ten minutes and we never waited longer than a few minutes for a bus to arrive. It also has an underground stop 5 minutes away which in 45 minutes including a short bus journey the other end gets you to Shoenfield airport for a few euros.

<Content>Spacious rooms, clean and efficient. We stayed in one of the larger rooms at a superb rate with a terrace connected to the room.The hotel is modern, clean and quiet. The rooms are spacious with fresh bahtrooms, nice beds and a modern light ambience. Really very nice.I did not really enjoy the breakfast as the restaurant is a bit too sterile for my taste... but hey! At the price given i would happily stay and have breakfast there anytime again!It is a nice and basic place too sleep if it is sleep you look for. Coctails and hustle bustle barlife is all out there outside the hotel i alla of Berlin.

<Content>LIndemann Hotel, Berlin I stayed here for 3 nights last week. Great hotel and very helpful staff. I didn't bother posting my pictures of the hotel because everything is completely brand new and in excellent condition - exactly as you see posted on their website. By far the best hotel I stayed in during my 2 week in Germany and Austria, and surprisingly, the cheapest as well.The hotel is in a good location, albeit a bit of a hike to some of the main attractions if you're walking. It was rather cold while I was there so I cabbed to most of the places I went and never paid more than $10 to get anywhere. I highly recommend springing for the breakfast that they offer - its well worth the money.I stayed in one of the Lifestyle rooms which is a bit larger than the Standard room. While it was a great room, if I stayed there again I would stay in a Standard room. The Lifestyle rooms face the front of the building and you hear a lot of noise from traffic well into the middle of the night (which you become painfully aware of if jet lagged like myself). The hotel is on Potsdamer Strasse which is a 4 lane major thoroughfare for the city. The Standard rooms face the back of the building where there is just a parking lot and I suspect those rooms are much quieter.I hope to get back to Berlin soon and will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent value and well run Very new hotel and it showed a little with certain things not quite in place. BUT i would definitely stay again. Its very modern in decor. The staff were excellent. I was there to run the marathon and had an injury which meant i had to keep getting them to freeze an icepack i had brought with me: it was no trouble for them. They were very polite and helpful.Our room was towards te back (ie not on the main Potsdammer Strasse) and was quiet. Ok-ish size; big flat screen tv; bathroom reasonable size but they dont provide shower gel/shampooBreakfast is 11 euros so not cheap but its worth it has a vast selection of goodiesAbout 15 mins walk to Potsdammer Platz (or three stops on tube)....has two tubes stations on different lines nearbyLocal area is ok but not too much going on..All in all would use again

<Content>Some good qualities but still not quite there This is a new hotel that has just recently opened with all of the issues that that might ensue. There is so much positive but there is also a lot more that could be done that wouldn't take much effort on the hotel's part, but would create a much better experience for the clients overall.The hotel staff is an asset - one staff member especially provided excellent service - the others tried very hard although did not quite reach the same level. The rooms are of a good size and have excellent storage space. In-room wifi is a reasonable EUR5 per day, although it really should be included in the room rate. Breakfast appears to be reasonably priced at EUR11 although we declined to take it. The shower is excellent.The rooms offer plenty of natural light due to their massive windows looking out onto Potsdamer Str. Unfortunately, the designers failed to take into account the fact that guests might wish to enjoy the natural light while not necessarily wishing the entire street to see what they are doing. Consequently, the windows could either be covered by thick blackout drapes or not at all - why could they not have provided window nets for example? There was no safe in the room at all and the door lock to the room was made unnecessarily complicated - it took at least 3 attempts to open it every time, even after a few days of getting used to it. No mini bar either. What really disappointed was the lack of toiletries in the room. The bathroom consisted of a single soap dispenser located over the sink, which meant having to get out of the shower just to get some soap. It turns out that there is no complimentary soap/shampoo available and these items are charged for at reception. This is disappointing when the rate hovers around EUR90 per night. Housekeeping is also poor - there was a large amount of dust on the bedside table which wasn't cleaned at all during our stay. The hotel is well connected to the public transit network in Berlin and reaching all parts of the city and its airports is very easy. Nevertheless, the neighbourhood is one of the less affluent of the city and while it felt perfectly safe to us, other travellers might have a different impression.I put some of my thoughts to the receptionist on checking out but they were immediately dismissed and I was told simply to close the blackout drapes if I had wanted privacy. I would consider staying here again only as a last resort - it could be so much better, the potential is there and the staff is certainly willing, it just needs some fine tuning and it could be a decent hotel.

<Content>New hotel in excellent location My husband, me and a couple of our friends just returned from a 2 night stay at Lindemann's. The hotel had opened the day before our arrival, so its brand new, modern and very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful at all times. We arrived very early for our check in after a long night travelling, and they had no troubles in giving us our rooms, we just waited half an hour for them to be cleaned and were able to rest and shower before heading to town. The hotel is very close to 2 U Bahn stations. (Bulowstr. and Kleistpark) that take you very quickly to anywhere in Berlin. Trains run often so you have no problem getting around. You can buy day, group and single passes at the hotel. Depending how much walking you'll be doing it might be enough with 2 single tickets per person per day. We used one ticket to get to our starting point and then walk from there. Then use another ticket on the way home. I would recommend you take cash with you, since most of the restaurants do not take credit cards, only cash. We had breakfast at the hotel, which was also very good and with lots of options (fresh bread, fruit, yogurth, lots of hams and cheeses, eff, bacon, cold and hot drinks etc...) It cost 11 Euros if its not included in your package. There is also parking at the hotel, which was included in our room, but I think it costs like 8 Euros for every 24 hour period. I can very highly recommend this hotel!Maria Holm
