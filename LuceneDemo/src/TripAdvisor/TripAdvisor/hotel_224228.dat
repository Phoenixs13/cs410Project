<Content>Great Stay at this Hotel We completely enjoyed this hotel. Everyone working at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. The people working the front desk looked up local information for me several times. The complimentary breakfast was very good. The evening light meal was very pleasant. We had the shuttle bring us to the Museum for the Tut exhibit and pick us up later elsewhere in town. That was very nice since we did not have to find our way around the area and construction (everywhere!) This hotel provides so much more than other hotels for the same price. Not a lot to do around the area (for tourists) but no homeless hanging around like downtown hotels, which I have read about on this website. I found the room very clean and nice, the beds very comfortable. We were even upgraded to a nicer suite when ours was still dirty when we arrived. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>BEWARE111111111111111111 If staying for Market, be prepared to loose your room even if it is verified by a credit card. I arrived at 615pm and was told my reservation had been walked or canceled. Five other parties lost their rooms too. Also one lucky person came back to the desk complaining of NOT getting the rooms they requested,

<Content>worst Hilton property I am a HIlton fan so I was terribly disappointed with this property. The location was not good. I arrived late and tried to stop at a few gas stations, fast food restaurants to pick up something to eat but couldn't get out of the car. I'm pretty brave when traveling but the location didn't feel safe.At the front desk the clerk told me not to go to these spots at night. I was starving. I had to buy something from the hotel cooler.The hotel was old and smelly. I depend on the computers at Hilton properties for last minute work and the two machines didn't have internet connection. The front desk clerk in the morning insisted it was working because the screen would come up but she didn't try to go onto the internet. Her attitude was oh well When I pressed her to find out if she was going to report it, she said it was the first time she heard of the problem. Was she going to report it, Yes, and when I asked how long she anticipated for someone to look at it her response was I had to wait a couple of days. I then asked her to check if the computers were working at the Hilton property down the street and she said she didn't think they had computers. I insisted she call and of course they did.I wanted to check out and move to another location but I would have lost my deposit. Unless you have busines at market place or the nearby hospitals avoid this part of town.

<Content>Will Stay Here Again This Homewood Suites is average Homewood. I have stayed at this location 4 times (about a week each) due to price. The rooms are typical homewood room. The double beds room have better beds than king size room. Hampton has better beds than homewood. The best thing of this hotel is the breakfast time. The chef there makes the best muffins. I believed they're homemade. The manager reception was good enough and they always replenish it until ended. There's whataburger next door and that's about it. Very close to Southwestern Medical Center and other hospitals (Parkland and Children MC). I may stay at this place again if they can give me good rates otherwise i'll chose other Homewood Suites around Dallas area that is close to restaurants and shopping area. Overal they were good stays.

<Content>Meets Expectations This is what you would expect from a Homewood Suites. The rooms are comfortable and designed for extended stay guests. The beds are not as comfortable as you will find in Hilton Garden Inns or some Hampton Inns. The rooms are functional, with kitchenetts, fridge etc. The downside is they are not set up for strictly business travelers. Work desk is functional, but not at all comfortable.

<Content>Great Stay @ Homewood Suites Stayed one night, Aug. 16, at property with wife, and 3 year old. Very comfortable and large suite. Nice view of downtown Dallas skyline. Looks like hotel is undergoing refurbishment, repairing sidewalk, replacing a/c units, etc.Greeted warmly at registration. Nice manager's reception, and good breakfast buffet (included w/ stay). Not much to do around this part of town, a little dearth on restaurants, though a Whataburger is next door. Sonny Bryan's BBQ is right up Inwood Rd. about 1 mi. from hotel - excellent brisket / hoagie sandwiches in unassuming location.Typical Homewood suite features you would expect - large king bed, seperate living room, large bathroom/vanity area, refrigerator, two-burner stove, dishwasher, all plates, utensils, etc., reclining chair in living area, leather sofa. For the price - excellent value ($ 90 NetDirect rate).Downtown Dallas about 2 miles S.E., and right off IH-35E.Southwester Medical Center across freeway.Would stay here again in the future.A very quiet and uneventful stay for one night.

<Content>Robbed at Homewood I was travelling to Dallas on business and needed a place to stay off and on for three months. Within the first 3 days, my vehicle had been broken into and the stereo stolen out of the dash. By the end of the second week, a collegue of mine had the same thing happen. By talking to other guest we learned of two other incidents where guest's belongings had been taken. Neither of our cars were flashy, or drew attention and this still happened too often for a Hilton family hotel. I would not reccommend this place to anyone.

<Content>Rooms need updating I was surprised that this was a Hilton property--the rooms were a bit rundown and had some problems. There was no covering over the overhead light in the bathroom. There was no fan in the bathroom, so it would get very stuffy after someone took a shower. The shower/tub had mildew stains in the corners. When we turned the heat on, the smoke detector went off, so we had to turn it off. The carpet was frayed. There were initially no washcloths in our room, and the front desk didn't have any (although cleaning service did provide some after they cleaned the room the next day). The rooms and hallways smelled musty and stale. There were rat poison traps stacked up outside the side entrance to the hotel. Yuck. The business center, if you can call it that, was less than adequate. No pens/paper were provided and the computer (there was only one) was VERY slow. Oddly, they did provide an atlas and a typewriter.On the plus side, the breakfast in the morning was quite adequate and the lobby was kept very clean. The curtains in the rooms really kept the room dark, which was also nice. I will probably not stay here again, as there are definitely better properties for the money.

<Content>Loved it! We loved our stay with them! They have food and drinks Monday-Thursday which was outstanding because after a long trip of traveling we didn't feel like going out to dinner. They also had room for our kids to run around in the back by the pool which was extremly nice since you didn't have to worry about the traffic or pool (it was fence in). In the morning they had a hot breakfast and it was much better than cold donut that I have seen at other hotels. Also, real easy to get around town to all the sites and back to your hotel.We would most definely stay at this hotel again for the price, location and food!

<Content>Spacious but noisy Two rooms including small kitchen, so far so good. But noise from the I35 comes through and all the rooms are in view of the highway. Otherwise ok, what you would expect from the chain, and only a few minutes drive from downtown. But I will not come back.
