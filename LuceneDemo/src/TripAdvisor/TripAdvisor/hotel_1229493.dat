<Content>You get what you pay for The staff at reception are relatively nice and can offer lots of information about the area.I opted for a single room with a window. However the window was of little use - as it just looked onto the other side of the hotel - so nothing exciting to view.The rooms are very small, and barely enough space to open a suit-case. There is no wardrobe - but you are provided with a few hanging hooks on the back of the door.The en-suite facilities are small but functional and the air-con is a much needed component.Laundry costs $10 to do.Be aware the hotel is close to a Mosque and their prayers over the tannoy start at 4-5am in the morning - so you'll definitely wake up with that.Other than that - nice small convenient hotel.
