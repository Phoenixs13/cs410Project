<Content>Excellent location, perfect for a city break We have just returned from a weekend break at the hotel, the location was excellent and the view from the window was out of this world. Just outside the hotel door is a bus stop and taxi pick up point and the metro stop Jaume about a five minutes walk.The hotel has free internet access, the service that we received from the receptionists was perfect for English speeking travellers.A really modern decor on the inside and a perfectly historic look from the main road.If you are expecting huge rooms then you will not be happy, but why do you want a huge room for a city break. The camp Nou is an absolute must and the bus turistic guides are not to be missed.

<Content>Loved the view Having arrived in Barcelona after a week in a tent at a music festival, the hotel was an amazing. I had e-mailed before I arrived to ask for a high up room as the vacation was a 21'st present for my girlfriend, we were given a room on the top floor with a balcony, What a view!!!! we could see the cathedral from our room. It was a large room, huge bathroom, with plenty of space and the free mini bar was a relief being full of coke/ water.The hotel staff are extremely helpful, always smiling and bent over backwards for us, the internet room is very small with 2 computers but your not on vacation to check e-mails!Only 2 complaints, they gave us 2 double beds next to each other rather than one bed like we asked for but we didnt complain as we just enjoyed the space and make a huge bed instead, and the walls and edges on the windows were cracking or falling apart, which looks a bit shabby.apart from that I have no complaints, its right in the centre of the city and being on the top floor like we were, when you close your doors, theres no noise at all.would definatly recommend if you want a hotel for a few nights.

<Content>mediocre at best... but useful location Positives: useful location for sightseeing. on the other side of the gothic quarter from the Rambla, close to the cathedral. Quiet room as facing other flats, not the main road. Friendly staff.Negatives: Certainly not value for money. Bathroom, albeit spacious, was poorly finished, had cracks in the tiles. The shower didn't stay up, the toilet paper holder had disappeared. No iron available. Not what I would classify as a 4 star hotel considering rooms were circa 拢150 per night. View was awful, looking into someone else's appartment and lots of drying clothes.

<Content>Decent hotel, if you get the right room. Having read some of the previous reviews I really wasn't sure what to expect of this hotel. We stayed here for 4 nights (Mon-Fri).We didn't arrive until just before midnight on the first evening, but we we found the staff to be very polite and welcoming when we checked in. We had requested a non smoking room with a balcony, well we got the balcony, but it was definitelty a smoking room. We rang down to reception and politely asked if it would be possible to move to a non-smking room, we were told this should be fine but would have to wait until the morning, so we spent the first night in the room. The original room was on the second floor and at the front of the building, very, very noisy! I don't normally complain about road noise, we were in the centre of the city after all, however, as it was so hot you really needed to have the doors open.In the morning we were moved to a non-smoking room at the back of the hotel, no balcony but that didn't really matter as the room was fresh and very quiet, a vast improvement. Nice large bathroom with double basin and bath/shower and very clean. If you plan to stay at this hotel I would suggest you ask for a room on the 5th floor as it's completely non-smoking and specify a room at the rear of the hotel if you want to avoid the noise, clearly the downside to this is that you wont have a view, but then when you're in a city like Barcelona the hotels only really a bed for the night, you'll be sightseeing all day anyway!In summary we were very pleased with this hotel, and its staff, and would stay there again.

<Content>Nightmare Arrived 12th april 2008. Small room with very hard matress and pillows. Advised on check in that breakfast was included. Had to pay 鈧?7 for poor breakfast. Found staff unhelpful and rude. The cleaning staff stard at 7am in this hotel, Whilst carrying out their duties they make noise. We couldn't sleep due to the noise level. The cleaning staff come in to your room even though you have a do not disturb sign. Found the nnoise level unacceptable once cleaning staff begin their duties. They had no consideration for guests trying to rest. I would not recomend this hotel.

<Content>Awful Staff Had booked in December to stay in this hotel for 2 nights in March. Emailed hotel beforehand to let them know what time we were arriving. When we arrived at the hotel at around midnight we were informed that there was a problem with our room and we were being sent to another hotel for the night. Was not happy with this at all but we went to the other hotel (Hotel Gotico) anyway. We were told to report back to the Confortel Almirante to speak to the manager the following morning which we did. Unfortunately we did not get to speak to the manager just some surly employees who were no help whatsoever. They just kept asking us what the problem was. We did not get even one apology they just did not care. I would not advise anyone to book this hotel and if you already have then please call ahead to confirm your booking. We emailed and got a reply yet still didn't get our room.

<Content>Great location We have just returned from a weekend. The hotel is magnificent and the staff with excellent service, We had a very late check Mid night!!in but were still met with a smile,8 floors up with a balcony with great views,Up early next morning to explore the city, just a 5 minute walk to Las Ramblas,Also a short walk to the Harbour area,didn't eat at the hotel but this was beacuse we had such a short time in the city and wanted to experience as much as possible, Even on our last day the Hotel looked after our bags until it was time to leave later in the evening,You can hear noisey people in some of the rooms and tea making facilites would be nice, Overall a great place to stay and we will be back again in the New Year.TIP: DO NOT PLAY FIND THE BALL WITH ANY OF THE STREET TRADERS UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE 50EURO'S.WE SEEN IT HAPPEN TO OTHER TOURISTS,

<Content>Terrible Hotel Some of the services Confortel Almirante offers:- Small rooms that were decorated around about the turn of the last century.- Showers with absolutely no pressure, although hotel staff will kindly send someone along to look at it for you and do nothing about it.- Air conditioning that blows hot air only, which means you have to keep the windows open, allowing all the noise in from the outside.- Blinds that don't close - Hotel staff that open your private mail for you.- Cleaning staff that enjoy a good natter every morning, outside your door.- No room serviceIn short, possibly the worst 4*hotel in Barcelona.

<Content>Great place to stay! The hotel is situated in a great place, close to the Rambla, Gotic City and close to Plaza Catalunya. You're close to verything, right in the city's center!The rooms are ok, the bathroom a little small but it's ok.The minibar is free (mineral water, Coke, Soda water and Beer) and it's the first hotel that I received this service!The hotel breakfast was great! I was before in another 4 stars hotel in Barcelona and the breakfast there was very poor. The people are very nice, expecially if you speak spanish.I won't repeat everything that is already told by other reviewers, but the bottom line is that the hotel is ok and I'll recommend it to my friends/family.

<Content>GREAT LOCATION having booked hotel through local agent for trip to Barcelona i was a little concerned by some of the reviews i found on the site which gave it poor reviews. I took the advice that was offered by some previous postings and contacted the hotel by e-mail directly before our arrival. I requested a non smoking room on a high floor with if possible a view. I have to say we were well rewarded as we were located in room 802 which was a nice room reasonably spacious with a balcony which was on the corner of the hotel frontage, top floor and had great views of the city both up and down via laiteana. the hotel was in a great location for exploring the city minutes from La Rambla, Placa de la Catalunya, the main cathedral etc. breakfast in the hotel was included in the stay and was a good way to set yourself up for the day. the room also had a small fridge with drinks provided free of charge. All i can say is that despite some poor reviews on this site we found this a good clean hotel with friendly staff in a great location.one final tip would be the bus touristic, which is the standard fare but over a two day period provided us with a great way to see the sights of the city and was a lot better value than its conterpart in London.

<Content>Well Place For Everything Sadly the Almirante is not up to the same 4* standards as the other Confortel hotel we stayed in, the decor was a little 'tired', to be polite. It is a smaller 'City' hotel.The staff were all friendly and helpful, and we found the hotel was kept clean and fresh, as were our rooms. We were on the first floor, with a small balcony overlooking the main road. The windows and doors were double glazed x 2, two sets of d/glazing so you did not hear any of the traffic noise. The bedding and towels were changed daily.There is a 'free' mini bar provided in the room, something that I have never come across. Cola, Water, Juice and beers, all replaced daily. Free use of the room safe, 鈧?0 returnable deposit for the key. There is also free access to the wifi facilities throughout the hotel and two pc's available in reception, again free of charge. We were board only so I can't comment on the food.What was the face saving attraction for the Almirante was its' postion on C/Via Laietana, yes, a busy road but leads to everywhere. A bus stop outside the door of the hotel, metro a hundred yards. The City Tour Buses stop about 50 yards away (this must not be missed). Barceloneta, the beach area and port is a 10 ten minute walk. Barcelona Cathedral 5 minutes. The lively area of La Ramblas is only a short stroll away. You are spoilt for choice for places to eat, but check out the restaurants along the port if you enjoy seafood.Not one of the best hotels I agree but its position cannot be beaten, worth a visit.

<Content>No more than 2 stars To starts with, please don鈥檛 get deceived by the photos on the hotel鈥檚 website. When we arrived, they checked us in a very small room that looks more like a prison cell and we had to complain to be moved to a little bit bigger room which was also ugly and noisy. They don鈥檛 have a bell boy so you have to carry your bags yourself. The elevator is too small and takes ages to arrive. The staff speaks very little English so it鈥檚 very difficult to communicate with them. The people at the reception are lazy and not willing to help with flight confirmation.The breakfast has limited varieties. Please avoid this hotel.

<Content>Not Bad At All I booked this hotel after reading reviews, some of which weren't all that good but we decided to take a chance as this is the area we wanted to be in. We were very pleasantly surprised. We had asked for a room on a high floor and we were on the 5th floor so that was ok.(its worth asking for a high floor) The room was large, very clean with a lovely bathroom with clean fluffy towels and lots of little extra's. The room had a mini fridge which had a couple of beers, water and soft drinks which were free.The breakfast was plentiful with lots of variety and the staff were friendly and helpful.The hotel is in a great location and dont miss a trip to the cathedral oppositeas it is a wonderful building. The only downside we found was that as we were on the main street it was quite noisy but we bought ear plugs and we were fine. We are returning to Barcelona and we will stay there again.

<Content>good but noisey comings and goings in the night Good Hotel well situated to get around and see everything - close to some excellent restaurants. Friendly staff who speak excellent english. We had specifically asked for non smoking rooms ,but they tried to give us smoking rooms - were changed to non smoking when we objected. Rooms are all well appionted - modern recently refurbished . We were two couples one room was excellent on top floor (8) with balcony with view of street and Cathederal . The other on floor below (7) had no view and opened onto lightwell with wall two metres away - very dismal outlook. Ask for room on top floor with view of street or any floor with view of street. We were woken in the night by people coming in or going out late on two out of three nights. Get to breakfast early or it may run out if Hotel is full . All in all we enjoyed our stay in Barcelona and would consider this Hotel if we return for its position alone.

<Content>Great location, pleasant satff clean and modern I booked the hotel through Lastminute.com secret hotels- came here to read the reviews and was worried! I need not have been as the hotel was in a great location, had friendly staff and has recently been refurbished. The room was small but was well designed with flat screen TV, great shower, soft fluffy towels and large comfortable bed. I think for the price the hotel was perfectly fine. We didn't have breakfast there but had coffee and croissants in a cafe next door.As for all the negative reviews I think a lot have been written pre the refurbishment of the hotel and are no longer relevant.

<Content>Good Quality Hotel I think before booking at this hotel, you should read all the reviews (both good and bad).Personally I thought this hotel was great - not 4 star maybe but definitely upper class travel inn at least. Good quality and in an excellent area to explore the pleasures of Barcelona. Staff were pleasant and rooms were cleaned every day. I was in room 705 (I think), so was far enough away from the Irish bar to be relatively noise free. I asked for a room with a window and a good view (I read this in a review on here). I think some rooms don't have windows so it's worth asking.Room was massive and so was the bath. Also had a view of the street below.There was no building work going on at all when I was there.Easy to get to from Urquanona underground.Book with lastminute on their gothic deal. Its cheap for a double room.Would definitely stay again.

<Content>Not recommended Let me start this review on a postive note. The area the hotel is located in is very good for exploring Barcelona. Only a 5-10 minute walk from Las Ramblas, 15 mins from the port, etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean with quite nice decor and modern. Breakfast was very good too.Now for the negative. We were on the first floor (we had two rooms) at the front of the hotel. The noise from the Irish bar below went on until 3.00am. The air conditioning in the rooms didn't work other than to make the room hotter. Many other guests on our floor had the same problem. If you opened the windows the noise from the main road outside was unbearable. There is no bar and no restaurant, although they do have a gym which is very small.The hotel is categorised as 4 star and we paid over 拢100 per night for each of our two rooms. I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Fab Hotel Just back from spending 3 nights at this hotel  have absolutely no complaints!! Our room (705) was huge for two people, the bathroom a good size as well with a bath big enough for 3 (in fact the room looked exactly like the hotel photos on this site)! The beds were comfy although it was two singles pushed together, room spotless  cleaned each day with fresh towels  toiletries. The free mini-bar was a nice touch too! Couldn't fault the public areas of the hotel but didn't use the restaurant so can't comment  there was no sign of the building work mentioned in previous reviews. The location was great as a base for exploring the city with many attractions near by  it's not far to the metro.

<Author>littlemissnat
<Content>very average hotel We arrived and they had no record of our booking (thanks to a totally useless budget website we booked with!) Thankfully, the staff were helpful and got us a room, but god knows what would have happened if we'd booked in the busy summer period.We had a double room. Good points:The room was absolutely immaculate and cleaned every day The minibar was free! Including beer and wine We got free toiletries etc The location - about 5 min walk to the harbour, 10 min to La Rambla etc and a tourist bus stop right outside the front doorBad points:The room was tiny! This was fine for me and my boyfriend, but would have been extremely cramped if we'd been overweight! The bed was rather small as well.The noise! Our window faced into a courtyard towards residential apartments - we could other people and also the deafening noise of traffic from the main roadThe air-con didn't work. Thankfully this wasn't too much of an issue due to it being winter!The restaurant - we didn't actually manage to find it until our last day there!Renovation work - there was dust and dirt in reception area and the lift.All in all, I would recommend this hotel to those wanting budget-style accomodation. You really couldn't beat the location. But it was definitely more 3* then 4*!

<Content>Great Location We booked this hotel as a top secret with last minute.com. Lovely hotel decor was minimist asked for a room with a window as previous rports had mentioned this, there was no problem. Room was adequate bathroom had all you required, towels lovely and soft. soft drinks in minibar free, also very good hairdryer in situ. Hotel staff very helpful. we went for a two day break to barcelona the location was great for the gothic quarter, las ramblas and the harbour. there was a nice little bar called Mcarthys two doors away which was good for a nightcap friendly staff there. On the Friday we had a beautiful tapas meal but i cant remember the name but in the window it had been recommended by the times. whilst we were there the christmas market was on about fifty yards from the hotel i could have stayed there all day. All in all barcelona is a beautiful city and we will certainly return and probably to the same hotel

<Content>Had brilliant stay.... so relieved! Just back from short break in Barcelona. Booked the hotel on Lastminute through their 'top secret' hotel offer. Got a great rate for our 2 night stay. But once booked and paid for and received the name of the hotel, I got worried. Lots of reviews less than favourable, but I told myself I wouldnt put up with anything so arrived prepare to vent at anything that might be less than perfect. But thankfully I had nothing to complain about all weekend. Found the reception staff pleasant and professional. Asked for a room with a view of the street and got a top floor room with terrace. Room spacious and bathroom huge. Every toiletry you could need was supplied. Mini bar was stocked and free. We placed a do not disturb for our first morning, and when leaving the room in the afternoon, removed it and requested that room be made up and it was done on our return. Room was spotless and cannot fault a thing. Location was fantastic. We did not have breakfast included in our rate, so ate in one of the many cafes dotted around so cannot comment on that. Overall I am very pleased with our stay and would defintely recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely return. The room service was also a pleasant surprise, delivered from a local establishment and settled for when checking out. And not at all expensive!

<Content>Good Location A well located hotel that has just undergone renovation. Some of the finishing touches have not yet been completed but on the whole we spent 3 very confortable nights here. The room was smallish but you cannot expect too much more from a hotel located in the centre of the city (who goes to Barcelona to stay in their room?!) The room was clean and the beds were comfotable, we had a room on a busy main road however it wasn't disturbing at night. We rang ahead and requested a room with a window / main road and got it. The location is unbeatable. I would recommend this hotel due to location but do agree with previous reviews that it is not 4* - whoever rated the hotel must have had far to much local wine. Which by the way was fantastic and so was the Tapas.. :o)

<Content>Unhappy! We requested a 4* Hotel and expected 4* qualityRoom although clean had no view from window apart from dirty appartments with noisey residents.No coffee/tea facilities in room only mini bar.Breakfast was a complete dissapointment- poor cereal selection and what was cooked was always cold and of poor quality.The lift aswell as being very small was also very unreliable and in most cases it was quicker to walk up the stairs!Building work started at 8 am each day and was very noisey.Health and Safety considerations were poor.In its favour the location was excellent being in the centre of shopping area and about 100 yards from nearest underground.

<Content>Avoid at all costs I would consider myself quite an easy person to please but paying 190鈧?for a night to stay in what was little more than a cell like room in a building site was too much to take with out complaining. All of which proved completely ineffectual as the receptionists were completly unfazed by our not unreasonable complaints but we were told there was no management around till monday ( we were there for Saturday night only) and if we wanted to fill out the hoja de reclamaciones (and official complaints book) as I requested we would have to go to an official building which probably wasn't open on Saturday. So consequently we didn't bother. The hotel has nothing to offer, there is obviously building work going on as there were bags of cement left lying around, holes in walls and builders hand prints on just about every wall but even when this is complete I fail to see how the hotel will be much improved. This hotel should rate no more than a 2 star by any stretch of the imagination. Take note of all the other reviews as I failed to and stay somewhere else.

<Content>Criminal Enterprise. Stay away. Filthy and crooked. My wife and I reserved a room on their internet site and paid for our room with a VISA card a month before we arrived. We received our VISA bill and paid that as well before arriving in Spain. Upon arrival the hotel denied us our room although I showed them the receipts from Visa as well as from their own hotel, which they had emailed me. They insisted on processing my card again, however, and we were stock with a second bill when we arrived home. We are trying to fight this still. Meanwhile, the hotel does not give out a phone number that works (the one on the receipt does not allow a caller to contact them) and there is no email address. This enterprise is a small fleabag dump. It is a joke to consider it a four star hotel, and a cruel joke at that. It's just disgusting, noisy and old. I have reported this criminal enterpsise to the American Embassy in Spain as well as to Spanish authorities. If there is anyone reading this who has had a similar experience, I strongly urge you to do the same. Stay away. Do not be vicitized.

<Content>Over Rated June 2006 - Just returned from a long weekend in Barcelona and staying at the Hotel Confortel Almirante. This hotel has been rated as 4 star but there is no way it's 4 star! The location was great and the rooms were average but clean. Avoid room 203, the view is....well there isn't any! It can be quite noisy and they tend to have 'echoey' corridors! Not fun when you're disturbed by noisy hen nights at 5 in the morning! Breakfast is 'OK' but definately not worth the money. One should venture outside to get more value for money. One thing in it's favour is that they have free mini bars which we were not told about until the last day!

<Content>The Almirante's Four Stars are a Joke Whoever gave this place four stars must be retired by now. If it were a two-star hostel, I wouldn't have as much of a problem with it, but I booked a group in there and we all wanted out immediately, however the city was packed, so we were stuck. My fellow travelers were not pleased, nor was I. How the city of Barcelona and/or the Catalan government lets this place call itself a four-star hotel is beyond my comprehension, but then there are several four- and three-star hotels that a part of small Catalan hotel chains that seem to have a star or two more than they deserve.

<Content>Didn't even stay, do not be swayed by location Booked this on the internet before arriving. I couldn't find reviews on tripadvisor due to the name change, until just before we left to go to Barcelona.I say do not be swayed by the location because there are so many hotels around here.Firstly, if you want a 4* hotel, stay in the Olivia Plaza on Plaza Catalunya. It is worlds away from the confortel almirante in terms of standard.I booked this hotel hoping for a nice, 4 night stay in a classy hotel with my girlfriend. I was disappointed as soon as I arrived.Unlike seemingly every other hotel we walked past in Barcelona on the way, there is no immediate reception area. Instead, you walk into a corridor, with a tiny reception desk halfway down. We were then shown to our room through some rather dingy, run down corridors and a tiny, tiny lift.Room was ok, but not 4* standard. I was hoping for something a cut above the rest, which is why I booked a 4* hotel, but this is barely a 3*. Despite the claim of air conditioning, there wasn't. I believe this was being installed the week after we were leaving. Being March, the lack of air conditioning wasn't as much of a problem as the fact that the hotel was centrally heated with no way to cool down our room. Could not stick the heat.The only positive I can say about the hotel is that they had no problem when we left the first day without even staying a night. STAY IN THE OLIVIA PLAZA! A little more expensive but worth every penny (cent). Presuming you book a 4* hotel because you don't want a 2/3*, don't stay here.

<Content>It's the location You are staying at this hotel because of the location, on the eastern edge of the Gothic quarter, very close to the cathedral. Where ever you're going, if you can't walk there directly, you can reach it by the local metro stop. Several charming cafes and restaurants within one hundred meters. The desk staff was helpful and personable and the cleaning staff worked ambitiously. Addressing the negatives raised by others...when assigned a room, we got the shaft. Alerted by Tripadvisor, we immediately switched to a street side room which we found to be adequate. I commend the management for effort, but the hotel suffers from obsolete infrastructure. Its a little cramped and a little noisy, but great location.

<Content>Great location, good price! I have just returned from a short stay in Barcelona. The hotel was fine, had a great location, was very clean amd had comfortable beds.However, we were also was initially put in a room with a window looking into a shaft with very little light, we asked to be moved and the staff found us a better room overlooking the street-they did this with no fuss at all and were very helpful. Didn't use the restaurant as there were so many great bars and restaurants near by. Overall, I would disagree with the 4star rating but would give it a 3star as the location couldn't be beaten and was bery reasonably priced, and did I mention the free mini bar???!!!

<Content>Really, really bad One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The person who awarded the 4 star rating should be locked up (preferably in this hotel - the room we were in had no windows). The location is quite good but there are far better hotels which are much much better value for money

<Content>don't do it! Positive Points : Good LocationNegative Points : The whole place stank of chinese food (bizarre), the floors were cracked and dirty, views from the room we had was onto a back passage was lots of peoples washing, noisy, worst bar in the world, foods crap and it is more like a two star. I've had better times in a travel lodge. If you book through easy jet they are lying when they say theres a restaurant cause thats bull.Good Irish bar next door called McCarthys tho!
