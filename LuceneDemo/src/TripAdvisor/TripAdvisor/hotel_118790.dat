<Content>comfortable, a bit shabby, next to the Phoenix Art Musuem We stayed here recently for one night.We had a suite. It was decently large. The bed was comfortable. The internet worked. The shower was excellent.The bad: the TV in the sitting room wasn't sharp. The TV in the bedroom was very small. Some of the lamps didn't work.The hotel had a general shabbiness to it. The outside night bell had been ripped out with only a couple of loose wires remaining. You had to knock on the door to get let in.The best thing about the hotel: The Phoenix art museum is literally outside the door. The new wing of the museum is great.So, serviceable, not much more. Good location if you're into the museum. I think the Hurd Museum, also worth visiting, is right by too, but I'm not sure.

<Content>Good Value, Great Location I was just in town to catch a playoff game at Chase Field. When I arrived I caught the hotel's shuttle which already was at the airport. Check in was a breeze. The desk clerk was very helpful and called me a cab so I could make the game in time as I was running late. The room was clean and up to date. The pool area looked nice, but I did not have time to take a dip. The only down side I noticed was there is lot's of street construction going on in the immediate area. I didn't notice any noise from it but the traffic is somewhat conjested because of it.

<Content>Scary Bad Hotel was dirty and scary - not a great combination, especially when you arrive at 11 p.m. Hallways dark, room only 1/2 renovated, exposed staircases inside, stains on furniture, hair in sheets. I could go on but you get the picture.The front desk staff were very nice and helpful, but we checked out as early as possible the next day and found another hotel for the next 3 nights. The place reeked of urine or cheap disinfectant, parking is in an unlit lot in back and homeless people tearing through trash cans directly across the street.If you are looking for reasonably priced hotel in downtown phoenix, check out the Best Western on Central. Same prices, nothing fancy, but felt like the Ritz Carlton after this place.

<Content>Recently renovated and decent if your expectations are reasonable Stayed here three nights for baseball spring training in March, as I was seeing both the Angels and Padres and it was kind of in the middle. Booked using my choice priveleges points (so my stay was free). At 8,000 points per night it was a great value considering it was a two room suite. The regular rates for this property are a little steep, so its probably worth your time to stay elsewhere if you're not using points. Anyhow the room was good, new fixtures and carpet, bed was good...the corridors are old (its an old building) and the elevator was scary. But overall it was average, nothing to be afraid of. Shuttle service is spotty however. Doesn't operate after 7 PM some nights.

<Content>Property being renovated I stayed at this Quality Inn May 11-13, 2007, while attending the Phoenix Improv Festival. When evaluating this hotel, it is helpful to know that it changed management (and brand) sometime late in 2006, so reviews before that don't mean much for the current situation. Check-in was a breeze and my room was ready even though I had arrived several hours prior to the official check-in time. My room was very clean and appeared to have been recently renovated with new carpet. Wireless internet access was no problem. The room was fairly good-sized for the price. The free breakfast was OK - nothing special. I didn't use the pool, but it looked OK. There were a few restaurants nearby, including the Old Spaghetti Factory (which was very good and reasonably priced), a diner across the street that didn't look very clean, and fast food restaurants down the street. There was a lot of renovation going on while I was there, but that should be over soon.

<Content>Conference Invasion We spent only one night at this airport east location, but it was not a great night. The room was okay and everything worked, but the hotel was full to capacity of young Blacks, apparently in the city for a conference. All was okay until breakfast. They hit the breakfast area with a vengeance, leaving nothing behind (including food!) but trash everywhere. When we complained at the front desk, they were unconcerned and said they would get the area cleaned and restocked later. We could not wait around while they did nothing--so no breakfast. Lousy attitude on the hotel's part. We would not stay here again.

<Content>Completely adequate - remodling, some rooms finished There is nothing special about the room, actually kind of small, but just fine. They are still remolding parts of the hotel, but most of the common areas seem done. I really liked the pool area. Considering the commercial location, the pool is a pretty nice oasis. Breakfast was what I expected. They do have hard boiled eggs (for those of you needing protein). All of the staff is very nice and usually spoke to me first.

<Content>still an econolodge This hotel showed up in my Garmin GPS as an econolodge. It still feels like one.They canceled my reservation even though I guaranteed it with a credit card, so they put me in an out-of-service room. The room had not been made up, so they handed me a couple of sheets and I made my own bed. This was handy since there were no towels in the room either and I had to use my sheet to dry off after the shower!Front desk clerk was very nice, but he was dealt an awful hand to play.Location is pretty good, but I doubt I'd stay here again.

<Content>A good location and a good choice We just finished a two night stay in one of the suites. This property is right across the street from the Phoenix Art Museum, and an easy walk to the wonderful Heard Museum (although the hotel will drop you off in a shuttle if you prefer.We found the breakfast perfectly adequate. The suite was large and pleasant and the bed was comfortable. The staff were accommodating and cheerful. The cafe at the Heard excellent, and with such a special ambiance that we had lunch there both days. the hotel has a business center, but no fitness facility.If you are interested in a place near these two museums, this Choice property is a good choice.

<Content>Better than expected Chose this hotel to escape the crazy prices of the convention hotels and get the free airport shuttle. It's an older property and most of the drawbacks could be chalked up to its age. Almost all staff members were helpful and pleasant, one night shift guy not at all. Pool area was pleasant and there was a good distance from the kid-centered main pool and the jacuzzi for a good evening soak. Bathroom and kitchen area were as clean as older properties can get, though the carpets were pretty dingy. Bed was firm which I found comfy but others might think too hard. Suite was spacious and it was nice to spread out. Fridge  sink old but great to have. Wireless internet was a little weak  slow but worked each time I tried. The mile walk to and from the convention center was pleasant and a great way to wake up and shake out afterwards.

<Content>Beware of the filth and spiders I was informed that my room would be a two queen beds when in fact they were two double beds. I had wanted to shower before going out to dinner but could not because the bathtub was filthy and had hair in it. I immediatley went to the front desk and requested my cash refund (I had my receipt I did pay cash). I wanted to go to a clean hotel. The desk clerk informed me that this was not possible until the manager came back in on Monday. The desk clerk did inform me that he was willing to upgrade my stay and put me in a suite at no additional charge. I asked him if it was clean, he had sent a woman who was sitting with him to check the room. She came back and infomed hin that the room was clean. I changed my room. After returning from dinner my son who is 17 and I went to our upgraded room only to find that there was only 1 remote for two televisions, the headboard on both beds were extremely dusty and the final gross thing was my son saw two spiders in the bed that he wanted to lay on. I went to the front desk to complain was told that he already informed me that he could not refund my money. The only way that anything could be done was that I would have to speak to the desk clerk tomorrow since he had been there longer. My son and I had to strip the beds and shake the sheets, since there was no staff available to clean the rooms and no key to give me clean sheets for the beds. The next day I was able to check out only if I agreed to pay the upgraded price for the room. Lodgers beware when staying here.......Good Night Sleep Tight.....................Don't let the bed bugs bite!!!

<Content>Very Poor Experience - Beware! I recently stayed at this Econo Lodge and would not consider staying there again. We were in Phoenix for business, attending a conference, and the internet listing clearly stated: complimentary shuttle service to the airport and civic center plaza. These 2 factors were why we chose the motel and they were misrepresented. The truth was that there was shuttle service to the airport only M-F between 7am and 3pm. The shuttle service to the civic center plaza could not be guaranteed at all. There was a van, and there was a POSSIBILITY that, with 30 minutes' notice, a ride could be arranged, AND the staff at the desk made it very clear that this could not be relied upon as there were other things going on at a remodel at another Econo Lodge that frequently made a driver unavailable to us. The floor in our room was not clean. The carpet was incredibly filthy and in need of professional cleaning or replacing. There was actually dust, lint, and debris on the rug in addition to the ground in filth. I would rate the service at the desk as generally very poor. The room did not have a guide or a piece of paper or anything indicating how to phone the desk or to use the phone for anything else. There was a notebook with empty plastic sheet protectors that WOULD have been the motel information booklet. I needed an area map and the first person I encountered at the desk said there weren't any. The next day I requested a map from a different person and he pulled one out for me from a large stack in a back office. My overall impression of this motel was that it was very poorly managed and that I absolutely did not count as a customer.

<Content>Nice for the price Nice affordable motel in downtown Phoenix. Within a mile of the convention center. Breakfast is donuts brought in and waffles. You may want to ask for an interior room if road noise is a problem.

<Content>A Good Little Central Hotel We have stayed at this property three times and found the staff more than helpful in each instance. We had a family member at nearby Good Samaritan Medical Center and the staff was gracious and considerate in offering us a discount for our rooms. The standard room is fine, but the two room suite with kitchen and two balconies is excellent value and much, much larger. A good central location with fast food and other dining options nearby. Pet friendly.
