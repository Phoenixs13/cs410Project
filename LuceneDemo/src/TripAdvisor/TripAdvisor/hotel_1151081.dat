<Content>Loved this Hotel....STAY HERE! 10/3/2008 - 10/6/2008This is a 20 minute ride from the airport in San Juan, (taxi is $50). If you want to get away from the tourism this is the place to go. You will see everyday people going to/from work and going out to dinner. But you will still feel like you are on vacation!This is a new hotel less than a year old. Nicely decorated with a modern decor. Clean as a whistle! The rooms are simply nice.... you can't ask for more! To top it all off...you can't beat the price.Continental breakfast was very good. Waffles, muffins, fruit, cereal.....you get the point. The staff was very nice and helpful. They were even patient allowing me to praticar espanol. Across the street is the beach. I would recommend walking down about 1/4 mile to get in the water, but you are not allowed to swim. It is beautiful. Or travel down to the next light and you will be in Punta Salina. The beach there is even better.There are places to eat across the street. Eat at the taco place and at a restaurant around the corner called Restaurante Meson de Playa. GREAT FOOD there! Try the food from the vendors along the road for authentic food. 1. Go to Casa de Bacardi - Tour with two free drinks2. Go to El Morro in Old San Juan - travel to Catano and take free ferry across. I LOVED this hotel and I LOVED my stay in Puerto Rico!
