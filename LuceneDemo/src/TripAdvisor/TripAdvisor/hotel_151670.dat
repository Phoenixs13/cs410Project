<Content>Good hotel at a good price. Convenient for diving. I booked my stay at Villa Parguera as part of a scuba diving package through West Divers in La Parguera. This was my fourth trip to La Parguera for diving but my first time at Villa Parguera. This hotel is part of the Paradores network, a small group of family-like inns scattered around Puerto Rico . The service was excellent. The rooms are basic, but clean. My room was on the first floor and had two double beds in it. The bathroom had a shower, no tub. The room also had A/C and cable TV. My room was fully-serviced each day while I was diving. The hotel restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner but I only ate breakfast there since it was part of my package. The facilities also include a pool (which I saw treated while I was there), nice grounds overlooking the Caribbean, and several lounging areas. I also noticed wheelchair ramps in a few places. My shower and toilet were equipped with grab bars so this hotel may be suitable for those with disabilities. The hotel also has free wireless internet.The hotel is in walking distance of several restaurants, two small markets, a village plaza with lots of vendors, and three ATMs. Keep in mind that La Parguera is a remote fishing village. It is a place to unwind. If you need a major grocery store or a pharmacy, Yauco Plaza is thirty minutes away and has a KMart as well. Ponce and Mayag眉ez are big cities about an hour away. There are nice beaches nearby in Guanica and El Combate. You should, as a note, plan for the drive to and from San Juan to take 2.5 hours if you go via Ponce and Route 52.One other thing about Villa Parguera that impressed me was the willingness of the front desk to help me. I had a flat tire while I was there and they called the tire shop to get the price for me and make arrangements to get the tire replaced. I will definitely come back again!

<Content>Remote Charmer First, be aware that Parguera is a long way from the airport in San Juan, which is a good thing depending on what you are looking for. It is barely a town at all, and is a good drive from anything you could call city amenities. It has bars, places to eat and dive shops. That's about it.Villa Parguera has a great view of a bay and is just too cute! But, you can't swim in the Caribbean there and there is no surf. The resort is mainly a refuge for natives, and seems odd to American taste. The setting and natural amenities are what makes the place attractive. The facility itself is OK, but you can't go much further.The semi-isolated location and hotel arrangement make this an excellent place for families with children. The pool is not heated, but has a neat waterfall on one end. The hotel is small, so there is no getting lost there.We were with a group of seniors, and enjoyed the outdoor sitting areas and small dock over the water as places to gather and talk. Night life there is limited to a couple of bars used mainly by locals, which was OK with us, but might disappoint a young crowd.There is a good reason most people rate this parador highly. It is an excellent redoubt for he money.

<Content>The BEST part of my week in Puerto Rico!! After three very expensive nights in San Juan and one disgusting nights' stay in Ponce I ended up by accident in La Parguera. Parking within distance of the shoreline the locals said that this motel was the best choice so I went in to check it out. The price was around 70.00 and although the rooms were not fancy, they were very cozy and had everything one can need for a comfortable stay. The air conditioner was new with a remote control and there was a sliding glass door to a balcony on my second floor room. Food in the restaurant smelled delicious but dinners seemed a bit costly so I chose to eat in the plaza with all the tourists and the locals to save some cash. There was delicious food available cheap and the pinchos...shisk ka bobs with chicken, beef, shark, or shrimp in US style barbecue sauce were mouth watering for several dollars each and a meal in themselves. They are even served with a slice of fresh homemade bread! The motel gave me a free ticket to the live show and although geared up for an older crowd there were many younger folks there too and it lasted till after one A.M. IT WAS WONDERFUL!! There is a large, clean pool and a good sized multi-level deck with chaise lounges for sunning. They have a large fenced in parking lot that is guarded day and night and FREE. In the plaza where they sell all the food and mixed drinks they offer trips out into the lagoon to see the phosphorescent glow in the evenings as well as fishing trips. The people of the village were very friendly and even with all the drinking in the cantinas surrounding the main drag I witnessed no drunkenness or trouble. The motel was so enjoyable I stayed three nights. A short drive backtracking in the direction of Ponce is Guanica and the dwarf dry forest and around Guanica and the sea are secluded beaches where one can swim undisturbed. This is really gorgeous country with so many rare animals and exotic native plants as well. Truly a great experience!

<Content>Hotel needs a facelift, probably not worth it We made a road trip all the way around the coast of PR, and we felt this part of our trip could have been skipped. Overall, the hotel could really use a facelift. Paint is peeling in many areas, our room had a dank, moldy smell, and the layout of the room was a bit odd. If you are getting a room, I recommend a room that is closer to the pool/reception area because our room overlooked the water but also overlooked a huge, white, tin roof just below us. The pictures may be a bit deceiving...there is a nice pool here because you are not allowed to swim in the ocean water. The view of the water is nice, but it looks more like a lake than the Caribbean sea. The town is a little bit dead. Just a few blocks from the hotel, there are some bars and kiosks, but there were not that many people there (I don't know where the locals go?). This also could be because we came during a mid-week in June (off season). I don't think the hotel is worth the price. If you want to visit beaches or attractions, you need to drive at least 20 min to get somewhere. The receptionists are pleasant, but not overly helpful. Also, be aware that this facility has a function room for weddings/big events. When we were there, a huge crowd of people were there and it was not very conducive to a relaxing experience outside by the pool. The next day, we went out to use the pool in the morning, but a huge group of kids (a field trip) was there and overran us. We did not enjoy our stay as much as we hoped.

<Content>Nice Waterside Stay This is a very nice Parador as Paradors go. We had a small room, but it was clean and was a good basic place to stay for the night. The view is beautiful from the courtyard and they have a nice pool for the kids to play in. Only problem is that we had a first floor room and the guests staying on the second floor above us made a huge racket when they got up early in the morning, which always woke us up as well. The ceiling/floor and walls were pretty thin. It is well located for making excursions on the southwest side of the island.

<Content>I'd go back! My children thought we had arrived at an upscale resort when we saw the park-like interior grounds overlooking the water with swaying palm trees and beautiful blue water and mangroves extending out into the distance. In fact, it was not that expensive at all. The rooms were nice, with a small outside sitting area. The pool was very pleasant and the grounds were really really nice. There was a boardwalk extending a short distance out through the mangroves to the water. There was no beach but there is no beach at La Parguera. We chartered a small boat to go snorkling and they picked us up at water's edge by the hotel, which was fun. The restaurant had good food but was a little pricey. I would definitely go back to this Parador.

<Content>Best kept secret I go to PR every February and stay in San Juan. A few years ago, I wanted to explore the island. I found Parador Villa Parguera online, and booked via interent. Well, it was a lucky day for me when I found this lodging. The staff is wonderful, the rooms are clean, the food is great, and the view is unmatched. I highly recommend the first floor rooms facing the ocean. Sectacular sunsets can be viewed from the dock on the property. All of this in a charming fishing village! This location is very convenient for snorkel trips, boat rides through the mangroves and evening tours of the Phosphorous Bay (best seen without moonlight). We usually take the ride to Gilligan's Island while there. It is walking distance to a convenience store and local seafood restuarants. We have gone back 5 times since our first visit. Our yearly visit to Puerto Rico doesn't seem complete without a visit here.

<Content>This is the place to stay in La Parguera, Lajas! Fabulous! This quaint parador is actually one of the oldest paradores in the parador system in Puerto Rico, located in the quaint fishermen village of la Parguera, a coastal suburb in the Town of Lajas (Puerto Rico southwest corner). Great location, clean, beautiful, gorgeous oceanfront grounds, fun pool, good food, excellent service by locals who have worked in this parador most of their lives, also located within walking distance to where all the fun spots are in La Parguera. There is a latin show every Saturday night in their beautiful Club Caribe that starts with a nice buffet of local specialties, dancing (two salsa/merengue bands!), a comedy routine, and a variety show. All that for $25/pp, a real fun night. I love this Parador, it is where I stayed every time I visit the area. I gave it a 4/5 because some rooms are showing a bit of wear and some rooms also need a bit of soundproofing.

<Content>They don't accept my reservation online! I made a reservation by internet and they don't recognize it. It was awful. They said that the website wasn't the true availability. Imagine, I arrived with all my stuff and I had to look for another place in the night!!!! They are people you can't trust

<Content>Lovely Stop in La Parguera I stayed there on Wednesday, 2/2/05. It's about 175 miles from San Juan. To get there, you can take 52S to 2 to 116 to 304. It's really easy to drive in Puerto Rico. The hotel is right on the water and has a nice patio or balcony for the view. The room was clean, tile floors, no iron. There's a pool. The people weren't as friendly as some of the other places I stayed on my trip. It take you 2 minutes to walk to the plaza where the boats leave for the Phosphorescent Bay. 3 companys each charge $5 for the tour. The town was pretty much dead on Wed night. Most of the places I visited for dinner at 9:45pm were closed. I did go to Dave's which has free internet access and only takes 4 minutes to walk to.

<Content>Perfect relaxation... I have stayed in many Paradores but when you stay at Villa Parguera it's another story!!!!! We stayed at a room with a spectacular view of the ocean, beautiful pool  gardens. The food is excellent, you eat like home. I strongly recommend the show on Saturday night if you know spanish, is hilarious!!! If you are looking for perfect relaxation, and feeling like home this is the place!

<Content>Very nice local hotel. This is a typical Puerto Rican Parador. It was clean, well equiped and offered a beautiful view of the bay. I plan to stay there again this year to snorkel for two days.

<Content>Waterfront relaxation! The Villa Parguera, like all paradores we've visited, offers great value! The few extra dollars to secure a waterfront room are well worth it. Although the room was a bit on the small side, the view off the balcony more than made up for it. The restaurant was okay, but not as native as we would have liked. Better to take a walk through town (look out for hens leading their chicks down the street) and visit a restaurant or lunch counter frequented by the locals.
