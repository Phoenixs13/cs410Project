<Content>clean and good hotel in a wrong side of city... hotel is clean. rooms are very comfortable. beds are very good. hotel staff is helpfull. breakfast is rich and taesty. location of the hotel is not good, its not easy to reach touristic areas of the city by walking. you have to take taxi or go by metro. around the hotel there is no restaurants. okey there are but, they are not looking safe. if you call taxi, taxi will charge yo 4.50 eur. to stop it from the road is much better. for metro you have to walk around 400meters.. other good point of hotel is, they have indoor secur car park.. they have no room service...

<Content>Good value, would stay again. Stayed here four days... then after a few days away the other three. Staff most helpful and courtious, especially MAIRA, with whom we shared many laughs.Breakfast was a tasty blessing with many selections... albeit a pair of challenging coffee machines! :-)Hotel as expected... functional, no major complaints. Hallway carpets could use some attention though (bad color selection), shows accidents.Had no security issues with area around hotel... went for lengthy strolls each evening along the mini La Rambla, just out the front door and two blocks left. Nice super market for reasonably priced items there and many little restaurants along the walk. A nice Barcelona experience and value!

<Content>Bad staff attitude and Poor location I and 2 other adults recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and booked 2 rooms in mid octoberThe positives - Reasonably clean, new and above averaged sized rooms. (this is is a new hotel)The negatives- Staff attitude. I lost my passport on arrival and needed help in contacting the police and british consulate etc.. but they didnt seem to care about giving any advice, just interested in checking in discussing rate cards! Then the telephone did not work in my room (which you really need when u lose a passport to call family back home insurance co.'s consulate etc..!!) When we repeatedly reported the issue they a technician was sent on our 2nd day of our stay, he checked our phone reported the error to reception, then turned around to us lifted his hand in the air and said to us momento and left the room.After that we heard nothing again from hotel reception or management about sorting the issue out. (complete ignorance)We just ended up using our mobile phones after that, and gave up complaining about the telephone in our room, otherwise we would have ended ruining our trip and sightseeing time completely!!I also like the way they fail to understand english whenever there is a problem, and start talking back to there non-spanish guests in spanish!!Also location is not so good, its is long tiring 30 minute walk from the gothic quarter and the the main tourist centre of barcelona. The area has a dodgy feel about with run down buildings. Nearst metro stop is Llacuna 5min walk away, but beware when you are coming back in late evening 9pm onwards, as on the first night we were there some unsavoury characters waiting at the top of the metro stop. We could see other tourists with us felt unsafe also and you could see them speed walking back to their hotels from that station at that time of the night!!! the next night we used a taxi to get back from gothis quarter and ramblas. if you can afford another 40 odd euros per night then get a hotel in the ramblas, barceloneta gothic quarter, placa catalunya or pasige de gracia areasFinally, we were advised on arrival that the rate for the room had been reduced on the day and that they would change the rate for us accordingly. On departure I was handed a bill for a total which I was satisfied. When I got home next day checked my credit card bill they had duplicated the transaction!! When i advised them of this they said as we had 2 rooms and 3 adults in each hence they passed the bill twice!!! then after arguing this point that there were 3 adults in total and 1 adult in one room 2 in the other they then decided to honour me the rate i had originally booked the rooms for and refund that difference only!!! So all in all I didnt get there reduced rate they promised, instead an unauthorised duplicated transaction on my bill!!! This sums the level of organisation at this hotel.You get a true picture of the quality of a hotel when a hotel helps there guests if they have problems, on this aspect this hotel failed miserably.Overall, I would recommend stay in this hotel only if you get the room for exclusive 2 for 1 rate ich hotels group offer on their website and a room rate of Euros 50 per night. nothing more. then it is worith it, otherwise dont bother. If your willing to pay more then a get hotel in the tourist centre of barcelona, you will enjoy your time more in a safer cleaner location.

<Content>Great Value and Location This hotel is new and modern and was great value at 鈧?5 a night. Barcelona is very expensive for hotels otherwise.The rooms are nice, quiet, bathroom not that clean and had a damp smell which is strange given its only been open since May.Check in was very slow but other than that the staff coulnt be more helpful.Breakfast very good.The location is great, a short walk to the metro which gets you to all the main sights without changing in minutes. You can walk to the beach (come out of the hotel, turn left, go to the second crossroads and turn right - beach at the end (Playa Bogatel) - 15 mins) go this route as its a nice pedestrainised boulevard with lots of cafes and shops. The streets wither side are otherwise quiet and not very interesting. The beach is gorgeous, a real suprise, clean, warm, great!The nearest supermaket is again left out of the hotel and on the left hand side. best in the area (only found it on the last day! its so close!)Id return here for sure.

<Content>Perfect place to tour Barcelona Reasonably priced hotel on the outskirts of Barcelona, so not expecting too much. However what a lovely surprise! The hotel is bright and clean, the rooms spacious for Europe with a really large bathroom. The staff were so helpful, advising us where to go, giving us maps etc. The hotel is in Poble Nou, a lovely local area with bars and restaurants and a lovely walk through to a fantastic beach. You really get the best of both worlds here, lovely and quiet and close to the beach and 2 minutes from the metro. Yet in 20 minutes you can be walking down Las Ramblas in the thick of everything. Barcelona is absolutely fabulous, with something for everyone, we stayed for 4 days, and found the best thing to do was buy a tourist bus ticket, which drops you off at all the major tourist spots, you can spend as long as you want and jump back on the bus at any time!. All in all Barcelona and HIE are fabulous. We will be back!!!

<Content>Well above the usual HIE average I booked three twin rooms in August for our party of friends that were staying in Barcelona for a week. The twin beds were both singles. The main attraction was the price of 85 euros prpn, and the reliability of the brand name as at the time of booking there were no reviews available.As the hotel had only opened in May 2008 the rooms were still in very nice condition. There was plenty of space, in particular the bathrooom was particularly spacious. It even had a bath which in my experience is fairly unusualy for Europe.The room had a flat screen TV, although the screen size was not particularly large, and for some reason they only had German Eurosport which wasn't particularly helpful when trying to watch the Olympics!The only downfall of the room was the slight lack of storage space for hanging clothes.I did see some of the double rooms (the other standard room option) when the doors were open for cleaning, they all appear to have a fold out sofa so even if there are two of you then you could go for the double and flip to see who gets the sofa bed.The rest of the hotel was similarly in good condition, and certainly more attractive than all British Holiday Inn Expresses I have stayed in. There is a large foyer from which you ascend to the reception desk and internet terminals. The reception staff speak excellent English.The reception floor wraps around to the large breakfast area and bar. The breakfast runs from 6.30am to 10am on weekdays, although they start to put the food out before 6.30am they didn't take too kindly to guests sampling the food before this time and they certainly didn't like the buffet food being taken back to the room!The location is also excellent, 5 minutes walk to the metro which forms an extensive network across the city. However we found the taxis to be very reasonable in the city (particularly split 3 ways) and I would highly recommend taking a taxi to the airport as it does take some time by public transport.The hotel is also about a 10 minute walk to the beach and a further 10 minutes along to Port Olympic which has many bars, clubs and restaurants.As mentioned in other reviews there is a nearby avenue of restaurants also.The neighbourhood does appear a little run down but we didn't have any trouble and it appears to be under redevelopment.

<Content>Nice Quiet Location I used Priority Club Points for my recent stay. The Hotel is located 5 mins from Llacuna Metro stop with easy access into the city centre. We took the RENFE train to Passeig de Gracia and then walked through a series of tunnels where we changed to Line 4. This took about 50 mins.We walked from the hotel of an evening to Port Olimpic and this took about 25 mins or so.Hotel is located in Poble Nou which is a neighbourhood, and 1 block to local restaurants and bars.The breakfast had a good variety, but the only thing we found it was so busy around 9 o'clock we struggled to get a table each day.Rooms were very clean, had a kettle and a supply of shower gel etc.Reception staff were very helpful and even let us check in early which was a bonus.Recommended for anyone who wants to be a few stops away on the Metro from the centre in a up and coming neighbourhood.

<Content>Nice, Clean, New New, clean, nice sized rooms for Europe. The staff was very friendly and the free breakfast featured a variety of items.It is close to the Metro stop and beach areas. Restaurants, shops and a grocery near by. It is about a 10 euro cab ride from Las Ramblas. We took the metro there but took a cab back to the hotel at 4 or 5 am.The only negative comment I have is about the grafitti in the area around the hotel but the entire area seems to be getting renovated.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel is like 20-30 mins from airport, price of hotel was between 25-30 euros.. guess which way driver takes u. Hotel is lovely, very modern. location of hotel is kinda in a funny place.. looks like its been hit by a bomb.. alot of construction going on.. but thats minor... a few mins walk.. and u get a nice row of local tapas bars.. and a lil south.. about 15 min walk, you get the beach, which is lovely. city centre is easy to get to... metro line is only 5 mins walk from the hotel.. takes u in the centre... overall... its a nice hotel... with a good location...

<Content>Great clean new hotel Used Hotel points to stay before and after our cruise. East of the main part of town about 20 minutes from airport. Really helpful staff that speaks english well. There is a mini La Rambla that is one block from the hotel that we had a nice walk up and down and ate dinner. The beach is 6-7 blocks south which made for a nice little walk to as well. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Taxi was 11 euro to go downtown. Great breakfast in the morning and it has a little bar to have a nightcap before retiring.Well worth the consideration.

<Content>Good but some minor problems Stayed there for business, the hotel had been opened for 2 weeks only, so I knew the rooms and facilities would be fairly new, clean, fresh etc...and they were.Access was easy by metro (5 minutes from Llacuna station)One major thing I didn't quite get is the reception is at 1st floor??? The ground floor looks like there's no hotel above...Positives: clean (new), easy access by metro, functional, friendly and professional staff.Before i go onto the negatives I must warn everyone I'm very fussy so some things I put in the negatives would seem quite minor to many people...Negatives: lost in the middle of nowhere, most sides are facing building works (can't complain about the noise as i was away most of the day), internet access wasn't working (server problem), room magnetic card failed every day when i would be coming back to my room (annoying when you are at the 3rd floor, exhausted and rushing to the toilets), the TV is accross the room, half way between the bed and the sofa (do you sit on the sofa to watch TV in your hotel room, personally i'm always on the bed), and because it's one of these fancy fragile flat screen, it's fixed to the wall, no way to turn it...Overall: Liked it, was convenient, good rate by Barcelona standards, I would go back and recommend it. Most of the problems I mention above were due to the hotel being newly open.

<Content>Great value in good location Having lived in Barcelona and visited a number of times since, I know what a hotch-potch of accommodation options exist. I took a risk with this hotel given that it had only been open 3 days when we checked in. That said, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it...Very clean, helpful staff, great continental breakfast included in the rate.On a map it appears that it is quite far from the centre but it is very close to the Metro (Llacuna stop) and only took 10 mins to get to Plaza Catalunya.Very quiet, safe neighbourhood. I would recommend this hotel to families, couples, singles... anyone who is looking for a safe, clean, low cost hotel in Barcelona.
