<Content>Brilliant Hotel Absolutely loved everything about this hotel, we had no complaints whatsoever, staff very friendly and helpful, room spacious and clean, location was perfect just out of the main hustle and bustle so no noise but within easy reach of everything either by foot or metro, Barcelona was just perfect we cant wait to go again. Would definately go back to the Astoria and will recommend it to everyone.

<Content>Nn nonsense clean hotel We stayed at Astoria for 6 nights in July 08. Its central location is the best thing about this hotel. It is just a block away from the local Metro station (Diagonal) and just minutes away from the top end of La Rambla and Pg de Gracia. Lots of great restaurants and easy access to most attractions. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are nice. The staff are nice too.A few important notes: When making a booking, it is best to go for a superior room option. We were first given a room looking into the air shaft and had no natural daylight. We asked for another room and got one with a street view for 20 euros extra per night... If you want to chose this hotel for the swimming pool, beware. It is tiny! It is more like a tub than a pool but the roof terrace is a nice spot to enjoy the sun after a long day of sight seeing but there are only 6 sun loungers so space is at premium.The breakfast seemed expensive at 13 euros each (though we were offered 2 breakfasts for 13 euros if you commit to have breakfast there for the whole stay). There are several small cafes just outside the hotel where 10 euros buy a nice breakfast for 2. Overall, i would recommend this hotel for its locations and clean rooms.

<Content>Solid Hotel in Great Location This hotel was exactly what I expected: clean, adequate, centrally located with helpful staff. I was looking for a hotel under $200 per night that would allow us to reach most destinations on foot, by subway or taxi and that had restaurants around the corner. The rooms at Astoria are small but clean. The showers had amazing water pressure and super hot water. We stayed in interior rooms which were pretty quiet and super dark - which is great when you are out late and want to catch some sleep. The second floor rooms have been recently updated and are very nice. The third and fourth floors are not as updated but I had no complaints. The staff was helpful with requests for things like extra pillows, taxis to the airport and small things but I wouldn't look to them to offer true concierge services. It is located on Carrier de Paris near Diagnol and we were able to walk to many attractions and it is also a good area for a jog or a bike ride. There's a great little cafe (Bar Paris) a block away that serves the most amazing bikinis. You must eat one of these sandwiches! I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>A decent hotel We stayed here for 2 nights and found the staff to be friendly and helpful. We were given a recommendation for an excellent restaurant just off Carrer de Paris by the front of house manger. The rooms were clean but quite cramped. We also found that the location was a long way out of town so be prepared for a bit of a walk to get to the centre. However the surrounding area felt a lot safer than Las Rambles area so it has its advantages. The only other problem were the thin walls 鈥?unfortunately we had to listen to a very boring conversation on the English property market from the room next door!

<Content>Good value, but some way from the centre This hotel is good value; I paid EUR 75 per night (breakfast extra). My room faced the back and was very quiet. The view wasn't great, but I have had bad experiences with traffic noise in road facing rooms before in Barcelona.The room was on the small side but the decor was modern and looked recent. Good bed and no problems with the aircon/heating or shower/bathroom. Everything clean  tidy.The breakfast buffet was perfectly acceptable; a reasonable selection of fruit, cold meats/cheese and bread etc. They don't serve food in the evenings, but the hotel is located in an area with a fair number of restaurants within easy walking distance.The hotel has free WiFi but I had problems connecting from my bedroom on the fifth floor. It worked fine from the lobby tho'.The hotel is at least 30 minutes walk to the real sights of downtown Barcelona. However, it cost me less that five euros to take a taxi from the city centre back to the hotel. The fare to the airport was just under EUR 15.The only English speaking TV channel is the ubiquitous CNN ...This is a perfectly acceptable hotel with good value room rates. Even if you build in the ten euro taxi fares to get downtown  back it is still an option if you are in Barcelona to see the sights.

<Content>Highly recommended it to anyone visitng Barcelona! Initially when we arrived, we were given a small room, but upon our request the staff moved us to a much larger, clean and spacious room facing the street (with funky, black and white tiles). The place was a wonderful deal for the money, conveniently located near the Metro, and away from all the noise and pickpocketers found in the Las Ramblas area (but not too far - we had a fabulous Saturday walk from the hotel to Las Ramblas and enjoyed every minute). And the staff was friendly and helpful. I have recommended this hotel warmly to anyone who tells me they are going to be visitng Barcelona.

<Content>Choose somewhere else I stayed here with three colleagues and none of us liked our rooms or this hotel which we most certainly will not use again.- The rooms were small- Two of us could smell tobacco in the rooms- We all flooded out the bathroom when we showeredTo cap things off, when we checked out my handbag was stolen (passport, keys, purse etc). I was at the front desk and my bag was just behind me. There was about 5 steps between me and the doorway where there was a doorman and no one around other than two guests checking out and staff. My colleagues had just stepped out the front door so there were few suspects but I'd guess it was staff.Even if it wasn't - the staff offered no assistance in helping me find it - and it had only been stolen seconds before I noticed - and just looked at me like a dumb tourist and just had me sign my credit card payment that I was in the middle of doing. There are many other, better hotels in Barcelona to go to than this one

<Content>Great value We stayed here in January and were very happy with the hotel.On arrival we were greeted by helpful and polite reception staff. We had a room on the top floor that also had a small pool and terrace area giving great views over the city. The room we had was excellent as along with a large bed we also has a galleried area with a sofa, fridge and television.Considering what you pay this hotel offers great value for money. The location is good and you can walk to Las Ramblas area within 30 minutes or grab the Metro close by.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Would Stay Here Again Before visiting this hotel i checked this website for reviews and overall i was expecting a below average hotel. I couldnt have been more wrong!The outside of the hotel is lovely it looks very posh. The lobby is stunning!!!! I was very suprised. They also give you a map of Barcelona and some tourist information. After we checked in the guy on reception carried our cases and showed us to our room which i think was a lovely touch.The room itself was lovely a very good size with plenty of storrage space. The bathroom is lovely all marble with complementary toiletries. We were on the first floor and the room just looked onto the back of the hotel not a very good view but that doesnt bother us as being in such a beautiful city as Barcelona we dont spend alot of time in the room and we certainely dont spend the time we do have in the room gazing out of the window. There is also a minibar in the room and its very cheap so make full use of it ! Theres air -con and heating in the room which comes in handy. The plazma telly in the room is good plenty of channels to keep you amused while your getting ready to go out. Also please note that when your checking in ask for the safe key as the safe is free of charge they wont mention it to you so you need to ask.Breakfast was included in our price which i am glad about as the breakfast was lovely. It is between 8 and half 10 at weekends. It was a buffet lots of bread, cakes, meat, cheese, fruit etc. It was all very nice and filled us up. Its a lovely dinning room very plush.The only wee grumble i have is that the hotel is about a 25 minute walk to La Rambla and Pl. de Catalunya but we tended just to jump on the tourist buses which stop just along from the hotel or get a taxi to where ever we wanted to go. The metro stop diagnal is only about a 5 minute walk from the hotel so if you cant be bothered doing a long walk everyday there is plenty of transport available to you. It didnt put me off but because i would 100% stay here again. Overall i had a wonderfull stay here the hotel is absoloutly stunning i cant believe its only a 3star it should be a 4 star. There is also a rooftop swimming pool we didnt have enough time to use it but it looked good. The staff are all very helpfull and bend over backwards to help you. I would defo stay here again and would reccomend this to anyone who is considering going to to Barcelona.

<Content>Nice lobby but not good rooms! Not a bad location, Metro about 10 mins walk away. (Buy 10 journey ticket for best value). Walk to Las Ramblas 30 mins. Nice exterior and lobby, with helpful, pleasant staff. We stayed in room 121. If YOU are given room 121 simply give the keys back and ask for another room! It was the worst hotel room ive ever stayed in. It was very small, old fashioned and nothing like the pictures on this site. The aircon didnt work properly and wasnt particularly clean. We only stayed 1 night but should have been staying 3. I cannot, however, comment on other rooms within the hotel. Barcelona itself is a lovely place though.

<Content>Very nice Hotel  The hotel is in a excellent location especially if you like to walk.It is a block from the Diagonal, 3 to 4 from Los Ramblas Cataluna which runs into Placa Cataluna and the start of Las Ramblas which will take you all the way to Port Vell and the Christopher Columbus statue. A block further is the Gracia. A great shopping street. Alsothere are two Gaudi works close on the Gracia. The breakfast buffet is average, but well worth visiting each morning. Additionally there are a great many bars and restaurants just outside the door in all price ranges. Finally there is a Taxi stand/stop across the street, very nice. The Hotel has been renovated recently and is in excellent shape. The bathrooms are typically europen for size but well done. The shower/tub water pressure was outstanding and the towels first rate. Excellent service from housekeeping as well as the front desk. Will definitly stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Astoria for 8 nights in October, while we visited with our daughter who was in Barcelona doing her semester abroad. Although it isn't as close to the center of things as we might have wanted, the hotel itself was excellent. From reading other reviews, we asked for an outside room (facing the street). Our room was light, bright, spacious, and very clean. The staff were extremely helpful whenever we had any questions or needs. There is a small pool on the top floor and also a exercise room (very small), but clean and useful. The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is safe and there are little places to have coffee  delicious tapas or bakery items close by. We didn't actually eat in the hotel, but did have a drink or two there. The sitting areas in the lobby are very comfortable and my husband was able to do work there on his laptop. Be sure to bring good walking shoes to walk down to the Ramblas and to the older scenic parts of the city ,as it is about a 25-30 minute hike. There are plenty of cabs and a fabulous metro system that will take you most places.

<Content>Good 3* Hotel We stayed 4 nights at the Astoria in Feb 06 and found it to be a good quality hotel at a good price. Perhaps it was showing it's age a little but everything was OK. We did have a problem with our room on arrival with a leak in the bathroom above but we were soon transferred to another room without any problems. The Astoria is a little away from the centre of Barcelona but public transport and one end of La Rambla is only a short walk. The public transport is pretty good in Barcelona and you can reach a lot of the attractions by the underground or bus. There are enough restaurants in the immediate area and we even found one around the corner that you could eat in at normal hours for dinner.We chose not to have breakfast in the hotel and there was a very nice pastry / coffee shop nearby where you could have breakfast very cheaply. The language was a bit of a challenge but with lots of finger pointing and other sign language you get what you want.Language at the hotel was not a problem, the only draw back was the lack of atmosphere is the hotel, while there was a bar it was hard to get a drink or someones attention to serve you.The staff were OK but not necessarily friendly but that seemed pretty typical of the Spanish.Anyway Barcelona is a great tourist place to visit and we would love to visit again some day.

<Content>Nice hotel, decent location The Astoria Hotel is a very good 3 star hotel in a nice part of Barcelona.My fianc茅e and I booked fairly late so checked at the hotels available on Trip Advisor and decided to go with the Astoria.The entrance is very nice and we were greeted by a friendly manager. Having read the reviews on here we had asked for a room on the higher floors with an outside view (as opposed to some windows that apparently open into an airshaft). Unfortunately they had none available until the following day but we were told that we were more than welcome to move after our first night.The room we were put in was nice enough but there was some mould on the ceiling above the shower (no extractor fan in the bathroom), and as we discovered the following morning, it was right above the kitchen so was quite noisy. Not massive problems but we decided we would ask to see the other room the following morning, which was higher, quieter and nicer, so we simply moved our stuff across.So, good hotel, and the location is pretty decent as well. It is about a 20-25 minute walk from Pla莽a de Catalunya and the top of La Rambla. However, the walk is a pleasant one, either along Rambla de Catalunya with its cafes, or Passeig de Gracia (one of the main shopping streets). We walked most places but there is a metro stop near by (Barcelona metro was very good- cheap, clean, air conditioned etc.).Breakfast at The Astoria was 鈧?2 which we had a couple of days. The choice was great - cereal, fruit, ham, cheese, yoghurt, croissants, pastries and even chocolate brownies, all washed down with orange juice, tea and coffee. If you only want a light bite though, you may be better off with a pastry from one of the coffee shops nearby.Overall, good hotel and good location and we would recommend this hotel to people traveling to Barcelona.

<Content>good value hotel we went to barcelona for 5 nights and stayed at the hotel astoria for all of our stay. the hotel was fine it was clean and the maid service was excellent. I had requested a room facing the street and got one no problem....I wish though I had requested one on a higher floor, and asked for a balcony also. but overall the room was big anough, very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was excellent and the shower over the bath fantastic.....very powerfull!you only got one english speaking channel on TV which was CNN...and noramally this we wouldn't even have the tv on but barcelona was so hot when we visited we usually went out early in the morning and later at night and spent a few hours in our room out of the mid day sun!!There is a lovelly terrrace on the roof which i think is unusuall especially for a 3star hotel. the swimming pool is more like a large jacuzzi though!The only problem I had was the echo throughout the hotel as everywhere was tiled/marble flooring and you can hear people walking about your corridor....unfortunatlly for us a group of about 30 rather noisy italian school boys were staying at the same time as us and we had to listen to their chatter till exhaustion finally took over them and they nodded off!also this area would have been fine if it had not been so hot!! its a bit further away from ramblas than i expected and we walked to metro (10 mons) most nights and hopped on it......but it was like an inferno on the metro with sweat dripping off most peoples noses!!! Overall good value for money, but shop around I saved 150 euros just from checking different websites! also it took ages for our bill to be sorted out and i was glad i had printed off my originall reservation as they trying to charge us full rate plus vat!!

<Content>Good value, loved the location Most of the reviews are dead on. Great showers, towels. We loved the location away from the riff-raff, but if you really like to be in the heart of the touristy areas it's not for you. The one thing we had an isuue with was the staff at the front desk. The service was fine, in fact we had some small problems with our room -- no big deal -- that was attended to and fixed quickly. But I wouldn't say they were the friendliest staff. We came down to the front desk a few times to get information, even to check out and get a taxi and were'nt even acknowledged. Not exactly attentive or warm  fuzzy. That being said, we found this to be the case with a lot of the hotels in Spain.

<Content>Great little hotel Hotel Astoria is a great value 3 star hotel with nice touches like a small swimming pool on the roof terrace (good for kids) a small sauna/ exercise room. Rooms were a decent size with mini bar and extremely clean - make sure you get a room with external windows. Exec rooms are available with their own small terrace. Helpful staff too! My companion had stayed in a couple of 4 stars which can be hit and miss in Barcelona and he thought the Astoria was much better value for money. Situated in a nice residential area about 15 mins walk from las Ramblas or 5 euros in a cab, plenty of restaurants nearby. Would definitely use this hotel again.

<Content>Great hotel We have just returned from a short break at the Hotel Astoria and it certainly lived up to the Trip Advisor reviews that had prompted us to book. Good location in less touristy suburb, just off the Balmes. Cafes on each corner with great food and atmosphere. Smart city hotel. Clean, spacious room with minibar, tv, free safe. Gleaming bathroom with fluffy white towels - great value.

<Content>not bad for this hotel class I think, given that this hotel is ranked with only one star on this site (two stars elsewhere, i've seen), it's not bad. Before reading on, note that we only stayed one night here and were out and about during the day, so this review is based on a short amount of time spent in the hotel.This hotel is located fairly deep in the Eixample area, which translated into more walking to get to the Barri Gotic or other places. For us, this wasn't a problem, since we particularly enjoyed walking around this less-touristy part of Barcelona. The staff were overall helpful and spoke a decent amount English. We were politely received upon our arrival at the hotel, which has a lovely marble lobby and a pretty winding staircase. Unfortunately, we didn't get the street-facing room we had requested, and instead had a room with a view of the unattractive ventilation shaft. The room, which wasn't spacious to begin with, was partitioned oddly with a dresser-TV-desk-clothes cabinet combo, making the room feel even smaller. It was definitely showing signs of wear, as evidenced by the chipping bathroom mirror, cracking bathroom tiles, and sagging sofa. I found it difficult to sleep because the noise of people walking by the room and talking, and also because of the hard, sofa cushion-like pillow (which I tossed away sometime in the middle of the night!). We didn't have breakfast at the hotel the next morning, so unfortunately, we can't comment on that aspect.During our stay there, it seemed like they were doing some construction in the hallways of the lower floors; hopefully some of the planned renovations involves the rooms too.

<Content>Passed the 3Cs Test - Convenient, Clean, Caring A beautiful little hotel very conveniently located. Furniture was modern and chic; room and in fact the whole hotel was spotless. Hotel staff had some English and worked hard to be helpful. We didn't eat at the restaurant in the hotel and so cannot comment on the food although the dining room and bar were very inviting. There was some renovation in progress on our floor when we checked in but the workers were very considerate; noise/dust were no problem. There was an erotic merchandise shop close by but we didn't feel uncomfortable at all when walking in the area, day or night - no unsavory characters or activities that we could discern. We'd recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Astoria Hotel - Good choice for stay in Barcelona! My husband and I stayed at the Astoria Hotel for 4 nights. We are accustomed to nice hotels in the US and Europe and really did not have any complaints. I think a key to a good stay is requesting a room on the upper floors with views facing the street. The roof top pool was an added bonus. Extremly safe residential neighborhood. Close to a few Gaudy attractions and a 5 minute walk to the Metro. Under 10 minute walk thru super safe area to Las Ramblas. Metro travel is very easy - great to getting down to the Gothic Quarter and the Harbor. Very helpful, friendly staff as well. Clean room.

<Content>will go back to the astoria! Just came back last night from first trip to Barcelona and we loved the Astoria. Located in L'Eixample, a bit out of the touristy area, in a lovely residential neighborhood, but only a few blocks from the metro and 2 stops down to Placa de Catalunya and the top of the Ramblas. Nice walk over to Metro, close to Gaudi buildings on Passig de Gracia, just off Diagonal, great shopping, plus restuarants and cafes nearby- we ended up loving the location.Place is spotless, staff very helpful, spoke English, breakfast buffet was included in our rate and was very good. Beds comfortable, GREAT shower and towels...Would definitely stay there again!And Barcelona was super - even in November, cannot wait to come back in warmer weather. Perfect location of mountains and beach, with elegant city, great art and architecture, great food, loved the chocolate shops, friendly people-

<Content>We'll be back Very pleasant stay - and all thanks to this community. We narrowed down to 2 hotels that seemed very similar, that is until we read the reviews on Tripadvisor. One was praised, one was slagged off - off to the Astoria we went.Its a little way out in the Eixample district, about 20 min walk to the centre of the Ramblas, which can be good or bad depending on what you need. It suited us perfectly as we prefer to stay in a more quiet classy area and go into the more hectic areas when we want.Clean,nice classic decor and nice fluffy towels, good neighbourhood. Friendly, helpful reception staff.The pool is a glorified footbath but thats ok.Unless your rate includes breakfast, take a walk. Try El Trobador(turn left out of the hotel 50metres), or my favourite,Farga.(Walk up Enric Granados past El Trobador and turn right onto avenue Diagonal - 200metres, number391.Excellent selection of all sorts of pastries for a 'pick your own' breakfast. Plenty of nice eateries around the area.Shop around for rates and check out directly with the hotel itself for special deals.Leave your car behind - those crazy buslanes- those crazy drivers, bumper car parking is a good spectator activity. Use public transport which is fine.Fell for Barcelona big time - what a lovely city. We'll be back, and we'll stay at the Astoria.

<Content>Great Value for Money Says This Finicky Traveler I stayed at the Astoria for 9 nights on a combined business/pleasure trip. It was elegant and had numerous, helpful, and discrete staff. While the first night I was given a noisy room where the elevator was on the other side of my headboard, I requested and received (the next day) another, much quieter room, for the rest of my stay and from then on, it was an ideal hotel experience. The room was modestly elegant and modern with fine air-conditioning, thick towels, and comfortable bed. I was surprised and pleased at the value for money.As for the location, I appreciated the quiet elegance of the Diagonal. The Rambla got wearying and touristy after a while. The Astoria is far from the sea, so if you're looking to beach it often, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. For everything else, however, I find the Astoria was perfect. The breakfast had serano ham, other meats and cheeses, and a myriad of other early-morning foods. The coffee was strong and smooth. Since breakfast lasts until 11am, it can be a brunch-y experience, helpful to tide one over in late-lunching Spain.Speaking of lunch, try the cod specialties and the crema Catalana at the Troubador, a fine restaurant just around the corner. It is one of several Troubador locations. This one is on a quiet pedestrian street with plenty of outdoor tables that pick up the delightful breezes. The food is fresh and well prepared.I am a rather finicky traveler and found the Astoria to be a terrific find. As long as you avoid rooms near the elevator, you'll have a terrific stay.

<Content>very nice place to stay Barcelona- Hotel Astoria The Astoria Hotel (a *** Derby Hotel ) is located off avenue Diagonal in the Eixample district. Located in an ideal part of Barcelona and accessible to all the stores, transportation, restaurant and sightseeing, the interior of the hotel is decorated in the Art-deco mode with sculptures and furniture representative of that era. Our room was nicely decorated with black and white floor tile and included a nice sized bathroom. The buffet breakfast at 12鈧?is over-priced and you鈥檇 be better off seeking out the small caf茅s around the area. We used Bar Paris Cafeteria down the street, which was very popular with the locals. Note that parking is very expensive and since we didn鈥檛 need the car for our three day stay opting instead to use public transportation or walk, we parked at a garage recommended by the hotel (located very near by) and left it there at a cost of 20鈧?plus 7% tax/per day.

<Content>Excellent value for money Stayed for three nights. The rooms and bathroom were very clean. We did request a room that looked onto the street (to avoid lift shaft). There was a free safe deposit box in the room and a mini bar. The location of the hotel would not put us off staying there again. We did get the occasional taxi as site seeing can be tiring but there is a bus stop directly outside the hotel and a taxi rank too. The bars and restaurants close by are excellent and the area very safe. We would definately recommend the hotel to anyone as it was extremely good value for money.

<Content>The Astoria - Well worth a visit! We stayed at the Astoria for a three night break in May. The hotel was elegant and comfortable and we found the staff very helpful with any requests that we had. We were pleased to have read earlier reviews that mentioned inside rooms that looked out onto a ventilation shaft, and made a point of asking for an outside room when we checked in. This looked out onto the street but was quiet enough, apart from the night when Barcelona won the Spanish Championship!The hotel is situated just inside the Diagonal and we found that La Sagrada Familia and La Rambla were within comfortable walking distance. The red and blue route tourist buses also stop at Francesc Macia-Diagonal, which is little more than five minutes away.Breakfasts are OK - cereals, cooked meats, fresh fruits and bread etc - no full English, but you don't really come to Barcelona for that, do you? - but avoid the scrambled egg! We did not use the restaurant as there are plenty of eating places within easy reach.Overall - well worth a visit.

<Content>Hotel fine but too far out Just left Barcelona after a week in the Astoria. The hotels fine but in reality its too far away from the hub of the city.My advice to anyone thinking of going is to try to get a hotel around the Barri Gotic area or the Place de Catyluna - there you will be within walking distance to most things and wont have to walk best part of a mile every night from the nightlife.Having said that, it is about 2 streets away from the diagonal which is a terrific place to shop.Thanks to previous reviewers for giving us an insight into hotelStephen

<Content>Lovely classic hotel We were with twelve people in this lovely old and small hotel near the town centre of Barcelona (12 november till 14 november 2004). What can I say about this 3 star hotel? The atmosphere and decorations are much and much better than the average 3 star hotel. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast is nice. Although I normally only visit 4 or 5 star hotels, I really really enjoyed this hotel. The hotel is situated in a pretty quiet street near the towncentre. It is very good located for all your trips in Barcelona. Don't mind that sex shop a few doors next to the hotel, you will hear or see nothing (untill you go inside of course!). If you want a late night drink just go to the corner of the street and there is a nice pub called Paris. The price for the room and breakfast was very good en worth every euro! If I ever go back to Barcelona I will go back to this hotel for sure!!!!

<Content>Great choice We stayed here in September and it was great! The location is perfect for walking in a safe area. We were near the Gaudi homes and other sites. The service was very nice, the rooms were lovely, and I felt like the hotel was a bargain. Very classsy.
