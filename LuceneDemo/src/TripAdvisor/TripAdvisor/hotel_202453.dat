<Content>Friendly and efficient We booked this hotel for a 3 night break over New Year. As most other reviewers have said, it is a pretty good hotel. Modern rooms, decent breakfast and friendly staff.Although some sites advise Fehrbelliner Platz as the nearest metro stop, but we found Hohenzollernplatz just as close, and it is towards the centre of town. It's a brisk 10 minute walk to Kuf'damm (with shops and restaurants). There are a couple of restaurants at the end of the street the hotel is on. (Emser Strasse)Transport-wise Berlin is great - we landed at Berlin Tegel at 6.30 and were in our hotel room by 7.15!

<Content>A little gem This is an excellent little hotel. Spotlessly clean, well furnished and spacious rooms, very reasonably priced. On a map, it looks as if it's off the beaten track but it is only 5 mins walk from the U-Bahn station or the Kurfurstendamm.

<Content>Great place to stay Settled on the Avalon after checking out many reviews on Tripadvisor for hotels in Berlin. Ok it say's it's 4* but it's really a good 3* hotel ,reasonably priced, room very clean ,staff very nice  polite, even had a bath as well as a shower which i like .quiet area  only a few minutes walk to the u-bahn  about 5 minutes walk to the Kur'damm . A couple of American 50's diners nearby ! jimmy's was very good give it a try ! Would stay there again.

<Content>Lovely hotel We have just returned from a 4 day break in Berlin, booked all very last minute. When we arrived we were made to feel very welcome and the gentleman on reception was very helpful. The hotel rooms are a good size, only downside was no aircon, but we were there in August, but there were nice big windows you could open! Berlin is a huge place and the transport system is excellent, the hotel is less than 5 minutes to an underground station. You do have a couple of lines to cross to get to a main line, but we managed fine, and it was nice to have the tranquility of the hotel on your return. The breakfast was good as others have said it was laid on four hours most days, we were surprised thought it would be continental but there was hot foot, scrambled egg, streaky bacon, boiled eggs, very nice. We had a great time, would recommend big fat bike tours, leave from the TV tower at Alexandra platz (think that's right) we had a fab time really enjoyed it. Also went to a show the blue man group, not cheap but we thouroughly enjoyed it.Hec

<Content>Perfect hotel for a stay in Berlin We stayed at Avalon for a week in May. It is very smart situated. Close to buses, U-bahn and is at a very calm part of the town. Kind and interested personal, clean and nice room. Perhaps with too much furniture. Good value for money. We'll stay there next time as well.

<Content>Pleasant hotel with some good features This is a nice hotel in a quiet residential part of Berlin but still not too far from the 'attractions' either by foot or by metro or S-bahn. The hotel is more 3* than 4*. I had an end of corridor room overlooking the small park at the back so it was quite quiet which I like. The decor was a bit dated but the room was clean ... and a good size, which is often unusual in European hotels. There is no air conditioning so the rooms could be quite hot in the middle of summer. Good bathroom (nice bath). Basic toiletries. Mini bar okay. Excellent breakfast. Staff very helpful. Wifi was a bit expensive (Euro 46 for 4 days) although there is a free terminal in the lobby. My main quibble is that on two nights that I was there the restaurant was closed in the evening (because of a tour group or private party or something). There are lots of good restaurants in the area, but sometimes it's nice to be able to eat where one is staying, particularly for a solo woman traveller. I'd be happy to stay here again.

<Content>Highly recommended Found this hotel when we booked a short break with Easyjet.It was a very enjoyable stay right from the off with helpful but unobtrusive reception staff. Room was just what we needed but for the beds being two singles pushed together that had a tendancy to move apart !OTHER HOTELS TAKE NOTE - the minibar was priced sensibly and as a result encouraged use; unlike other places who use price lists 'from the Ritz'. Well done Avalon, sound Germanic business sense.Breakfast was good without being spectacular but it is served for 4 hours and very useful whether you want to get off early or have a lie in and still eat before venturing off.The excellent U-Bahn is less than 5 minutes walk away - we used Fehrbelliner Platz which is closest.Don't be put off by it seeming to be a bit out of the centre, the transport links make the whole city within convenient reach. If the weather is kind then hire a bike, Berlin and Berlin drivers make cycling very enjoyable.

<Content>Nice weekend at the Avalon We found the Hotel Avalon to be a nice place to stay. Staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were comfortable and very clean.Breakfast was plentiful, both hot and cold, and kept us going for the morning ahead. A ten minute walk takes you to the main shopping street, The Kurfustendmm. The Underground is just a short walk around the corner from the hotel.  We would use the hotel again.We had a great stay.Up the road from the hotel, is Route 66, an American diner.Food is good, large portions, quick service,not too expensive, and it has a nice ambience.

<Content>NICE 3* STAR HOTEL This is a lovely hotel, very clean and tidy. The rooms were a good size and well kept. The Avalon calls itself a 4* hotel, I would say that it was a good 3*. Breakfast was a let down, the hot food wasn't replenished, and from about 9am onwards there was little left which was cold.Service was okay, not overly friendly but pleasant.The hotel is a bit out of the way from the city centre, and you really need to get about 2 underground lines to get anywhere. There is an underground station about 5-10 mins walk away from the hotel, the maps were easy to understand and a train came every 5 mins.There is an american diner and bars and the top of the Emser Strasse (where the hotel is located), unfortunately, we only discovered these on our last morning when we went for a walk after breakfast so I cannot comment on them. All other facilities are in the city centre.

<Content>Good Value This hotel is well placed and good for transport. You could get the bus just round the corner every 10 minutes into Zoo station and there was an underground not far away. We walked to the main shopping area Kurfurstendamm a few times as well.The rooms were a bit basic but warm with a television and very clean.The breakfast was good with cereals, bread, yoghurts, meats, cheese, eggs etc.All the staff were friendly. Very good value for money
