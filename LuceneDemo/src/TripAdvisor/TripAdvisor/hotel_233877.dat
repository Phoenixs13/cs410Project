<Content>A good deal I concur with most reviewers that it is a good hotel for the price. It's handy for the Ostbahnhof and great if you're a trendy young clubber (which I'm not) heading off to the uberclub 'Berghain' just the other side of the station in an old powerstation. My top Berlin tips....hire a bike - there are cycle lanes everywhere and drivers seem generally bike-aware and courteous, and as Berlin is so flat you can cover a lot of miles. Treptower park for some amazing communist-era grandioseness.

<Content>Good value We have stayed in the Ibis Hotel for several nights in different years, mainly serving as a stopover on our way to other locations in Europe. It's one of the cheaper options - i got a rate as low as 41 euros through online booking. Although the area, around to Ostbahnhof,is dull and there's not much to do, the hotel itself is great with friendly staff and a cosy bar, and since it's so close to the station you can get anywhere in just a few minutes. I can recommend the hotel to anyone not willing to spend a lot of money yet seeking for the comfort Ibis is known for.

<Content>Not expensive, good location - You won't do better in Berlin Stayed 3 times. Good location. A great busy hotel with good breakfast and bar. Have not eaten there. 5 mins. walk from railway station that has everything. So many things nearby. Secure underground parking.

<Content>A Great Base Enjoyed a Three Night Break .24 Men took 12 Double rooms to celebrate a 50th Birthday.Flying from East Midlands and staying from Thursday till Sunday.The hotel was clean and tidy and adequate for our requirements.Dont bother with Breakfast the Station complex across the road offers a far better selection.Location a little remote for the attractions but very convenient for the station.The staff were excellent speaking excellent English.If you like that early morning Cuppa,take the jug kettle as there are no room facilities.

<Content>Overlooked, but a good choice Stayed here for the Berlin Marathon in Sep 2007. Very easy to get to (come out of the front entrance of the Ostbahnhof train station, look across the street to your right, and its there! Just be careful when crossing the road...) , it is more geared to the business traveller, but has plenty to offer the casual tourist. Very reasonably priced (even for Berlin), the rooms are fairly spacious, the hotel is very clean and tidy, all with modern (if bland) furniture. The staff are friendly and speak a variety of languages (marked out by flags on thier name badges). Being a chain hotel, it comes with a good variety of mod-cons, ranging from a mini-bar to internet access, and the breakfast buffet has a wide selection of cold food to choose from. The locale itself is nothing to write home about, however, the largest remaining section of the Berlin wall is only a two minutes walk away, and is an interesting look at Berlin's recent past, something that's strangely missed by most tourists. As for everything else, the Ostbahnhof is a major train hub and the next train to a more exciting part of Berlin is only a few minutes away.Of course, being a mid-range chain hotel means its never going to be featured in the latest 'Rough Guides' or 'Lonely Planet' book. However, if you're looking for a comfortable, if somewhat forgettable place to stay, the Ibis Berlin Ostbahnhof is an ideal choice.

<Content>Good Value; Great Location Me and three friends stayed at the IBIS Ostbahnhof for 4 nights during the Football World Champioship. Location is perfect (just opposite the Ostbahnhof and just 30 minutes taxi drive from Tegel Airport), rooms quite comfortable and staff very friendly. I really recommend it!

<Content>German efficiency! My wife and I stayed here for two nights in Jan. 2006. The best thing it's got going for it is it's a fairly new building, so everything looks new, it's comfy, a tad small, and cheap! We paid 49 euros a night. There's nothing around the neighborhood really, but you can go into the Ostbahnhof station across the street and get a quick bite to eat. It's not a bad place to stay at all if this is your cheapest option, but you can find similar places like this with a more colorful neighborhood.

<Content>Perfect for Tourists on a budget! This was the cheapest decent looking hotel deal that I could find in Berlin. It certainly provided excellent value for money and I would recommend it to anyone who wants nice, clean but not luxury accomodation as a base for exploring the city.I cannot stress how ideal the location is. The hotel is directly opposite the ostbahnhof (which is the main train station of East Berlin) so it is absolutely perfect for travelling to all the main sites. The Alexanderplatz is about a 20 minute walk from the hotel and the Reichstag is about 25 minutes on the S-bahn. However, if you do choose this hotel I would make sure that you familiarise yourself with the transport system and learn a little basic german so that you get on/off at the right stations! I am lucky that my boyfriend lives in Germany and is a fluent language speaker so that may have made it easier for us to do all the siteseeing.There is free internet access in the reception which is very handy. The bar is also a nice area to chill in the evenings and there is a small menu of barsnacks if you get peckish (e.g. chicken wings etc.)The staff seemed nice enough and we had no problems. I would recommend not paying extra for the breakfast because there are lots of nice places to east in the Ostbahnhof (and Alexanderplatz). We made a point of having breakfast in a different place every day and subsequently got to try lots of different German cuisine at very reasonable prices (cheaper than the hotel breakfast).Overall, this hotel is definitely worth the money.

<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent location Wonderful value for money, spotlessly clean, warm and comfortable. Location is perfect especially if coming from Schonfeldt Airport. Hotel can be seen from Ostbahnhof. 5 mins to Alexanderplatz by fast, efficient and convenient public transport. Have no hesitation in reccomending it to anyone and I have a great deal of experience of staying in hotels.

<Content>A fantastic value What a great find. The hotel is in the Eastern part of Berlin, a five minute walk from the Ostbhanhof. The hotel is spotless. The rooms are small but have all the amenities one would need. It is in a very quiet location. One does not hear the traffic on the street. The lobby is small, but clean and there is a lobby bar also. Breakfast is not included in the rate, I paid 44Euros a night, and that can be for one or two persons. The doors to the rooms and even the elvevator work with a key card, so safety is certainly not an issue. From the Ostbahnhof, it is less that five minutes by S-Bahn to Alexanderplatz and another ten minutes to the city centre. This hotel is a great find. I recommend it unconditionaly.

<Content>This hotel is a well kept secret This hotel was exactly what I had wanted and more. Not too much smoke, Excellent prices, good location next to both surface and undergound transport, ATM nearby for sudden infusions of cash, and lots of unpublicized conveniences like free internet and a 24 hour store next door (very convenient for the odd needs of the jet lagged). The staff can be snippy but I found that if I gave it right back, soon we were both laughing about whatever problem started it.

<Content>Good value! We stayed in this hotel a couple of nights when visiting the city. The price in unbelievable! The rooms are spacious, well-equiped as you expect from Ibis. The breakfast is very good. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of the Ostbahnhof at which the train will take you directly into the city. The hotel is not really downtown and it will take you 15 mins extra to get downtown, but if you don't want to pay the downtown prices: choose the Ibis. Parking at a small fee is possible in their indoor parking garage. We will definitely visit again
