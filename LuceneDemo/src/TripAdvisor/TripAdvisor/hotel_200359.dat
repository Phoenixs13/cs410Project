<Content>do not go there unless you really need to The hotel is extremely basic, do not expect much. No room service, no minibar, and yuck, soap that other people have used, to save money.Also, people entered our room with the do not disturb sign on the door. Walls had spots and room smelled smokey. Do not go there unless you really need to. We had to pay to whole stay on the first night, otherwise we would have left early to another hotel.

<Content>Good Stay and Location This hotel is just 3 minutes from the Messe so ideal location if on a conference or exhibition. Hotel is basic but clean and comfortable.Restaurant is OK and bar comfortable.Would recommend for the Messe but not for a longer stay as has no luxuries......

<Content>An excellent hotel In some countries, this hotel wouldn't be a two-star (as it is), but a four-star hotel! It's very clean and tidy, my room was spacious and really tastefully decorated, the bathroom was spotless. I loved the breakfast room at the top floor, which offered a spectacular view of the sunrise over Berlin! The staff hardly speaks English, but anyway, they are all really nice. It's quite far from the center of the city, but there's an U-bahn station nearby, it's about 30mins ride to Alexanderplatz, and it costs about 2EUR.
