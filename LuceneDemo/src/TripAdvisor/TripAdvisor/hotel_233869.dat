<Content>Great deal Nice hotel in a great location: one minute from the U-Bahn station, 10 minutes walk from PotsdamerPlatz and 15-20 minutes walk from KuDam. Excellent breakfast, even for us Kosher eating. Nice and comfortable room. Pleasant atmosphere and helpful staff. Graet deal for the money.

<Content>berlin on a budget Inexpensive and spacious for the price. Friendly service, and near enough to everything you鈥檒l want to do (most places are a ~10 minute walk away). I would stay here again.

<Content>Clean, friendly hotel on a quiet street Called from Tegel airport and the lady at the hotel reception had a room at a reasonable price. She gave me very clear directions to the hotel. The room was very clean and pleasant, and the bathroom was a good size with a nice shower stall. Very comfortable bed. Good breakfast bar the next morning. The staff were all friendly and pleasant.I really enjoyed my stay here, and would be happy to stay here again.

<Content>Pity about the location I chose this hotel because I wanted to stay near to Potsdamerplatz during my last stay in Berlin. I should have known in advance - as a general rule it is always better to find accommodation in the East of the city. Anything you will want to do will be in the 'Mitte' area which is in the East.On arrival I was extremely concerned by the location of the hotel. There was a sex shop on the corner opposite it and lots of 'working girls' in the street next to the one the hotel is situated in. As a lone female traveller I was rather uncertain about even staying in the hotel given its situation. The hotel is situated close to two main U-Bahn station which makes it easy to escape the area. I just stuck to taxis when returning at night to the hotel. The hotel itself is fine. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful and there is a 24 hour reception. (You have to buzz to get in after a certain time.) You also drop your key off when leaving the hotel which gives you one less thing to worry about carrying around with you during the day! I was a little disappointed with the room. I stayed in the Circus Hostel the year before and was really impressed by the size of the room I had there - and this has been my usual experience of hotels in Berlin. My single bed was not very comfortable - quite narrow. So narrow I was scared to turn over for fear of falling out of bed! The window didn't close either which made it noisy at night!On the plus side there was a good shower room with a fairly decent shower cubicle. There was also a mini bar which was free to use(!) and a TV in the room with a mixture of English language and German language stations.I would be reluctant to recommend this to anyone visiting Berlin - especially for the first time! Berlin is a safe city and very pleasant city to stay in . This has got to be the first time I have felt unsafe or uncomfortable walking around the city on my own. There are many better hotels in the city - and also the excellent Circus Hostel. Try elsewhere before settling for this hotel.

<Content>Good Value for money For the price we paid this was an excellent option. Two u-bahn stations very close, one of them on a very handy line to shopping, airport and area for going out. Berlin has so many different areas you will travel so you may as well be close to a u-bahn. Really clean, above basic but not luxurious hotel. Really friendly staff and free (basic) mini bar in the room. Walking distance of Potsdamer Platz and although the immediate area is fairly residential there are a few bars/restaurants. Check out Victoria bar for fab elegant cocktails! Definite recommend this hotel for not quite budget but not luxury travellors.

<Content>Out of the way hotel Although there was an U-Bahn line very near to the hotel, it wasn't really within walking distance of anywhere nice to eat or drink or any shopping facilities other than small supermarkets. The reception and breakfast area are very small, although the receptionists were generally friendly and helpful. We had breakfast just one of the mornings we stayed; it wasn't included in the price and was a bit expensive for what was available. Our room was large, with a good bathroom. There was a mini-fridge (very helpful in the middle of summer) and a large balcony outside which we shared with one other room. The only problem with the room was the fact that the door onto the balcony was the only means of getting air into the room and it only opened out wide. This meant leaving the door open wide all night, which wasn't ideal as our balcony was accessible from all the floors of the hotel. There were no fans available in the hotel, so the room was always uncomfortably hot. Generally, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.

<Content>The Worst Hotel Ever The hotel looks like a factory on the out side. They have cleverly disguised its look on the website photos by putting people in front of a massive gate. Inside reception is small and dingy. The rest of the hotel isn't much better. The room was a very odd shape and it was difficult to find anywhere to put anything. the tv didn't work properly. it wasn't very clean. the room was smelly. There was no air conditioning or fan. The bed was uncomfortable. There isn't much to do in the area.On the plus side, the staff were ok.I would not stay here again, I i wouldn't stay in the area again either.

<Content>Recommended I stayed here for 2 nights with my teenage daughter; we had a clean twin room with comfortable beds. Location is good - 2 blocks from 2 U-bahn lines; walking distance (0.5km) south of Potsdamer Platz. Breakfast is worth the fee (E10/person) if you like a full meal to start the day - otherwise skip it and go to a cafe. helpful staff. We'd happily go back.

<Content>very nice experience we stayed there for a week on New year's eve 2003 and we were very happy with it. For the price we got (average 65 eur/night) I think we got a very good deal. the hotel is small and fairly new, very well kept. The service (reception, housekeeping) is very efficient and discreet and the simple rooms are clean and modern. I especially liked the location on a very quiet side street. It's nothing special in itself , but it's exactly in the middle between east and west so you can go anywhere without too many complicate changes of U or S-bahn lines, something likely to happen if you stay on Kudamm. Some things ( Potsdamer Platz and the Kulturforum, the Nollendorf Platz district) are actually in walking distance.
