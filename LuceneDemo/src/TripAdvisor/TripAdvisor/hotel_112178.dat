<Content>WOW - Arizona Grand Resort is Outstanding! I just returned from a wonderful stay at the Arizona Grand Resort! I was there to coordinate a corporate event for our company and clients. In a word - WOW! The resort itself is absolutely beautiful (I wish I could have stayed longer to enjoy all the fabulous amenities)! The staff was super 鈥?professional, accommodating, extremely helpful and full of wonderful suggestions to make our event a huge success. The food especially was a big hit - I think everyone went back for seconds (and even thirds)! I hope this was the first of many more trips to the Arizona Grand Resort! I definitely recommend checking them out 鈥?whether for business or pleasure.

<Content>My Family LOVES THIS PLACE!!! Loved this place. I can't believe anyone else that had a negative review of this resort! We travel to many resorts throughout the U.S. and this was one of the TOPS! The rooms were so clean and nice. Very updated and modern decor. The staff was extremely friendly. The waterpark is the best. My family had a ball, well worth every dime we spent. Great service in the waterpark. Check-in and check-out was easy and professional. Great restaurants on and around the property! The staff has definitely been trained well on Great Service! I highly recommend it.

<Content>Great family resort! We just came back from 4 relaxing days at the Arizona Grand Resort. I was looking for a hotel that was family friendly and had a little adult fun too for my husbands birthday weekend. Having booked the resort online through Expedia I wasn't sure what to expect, but all the reviews sounded pretty good. What a surprise to find a beautiful well maintianed resort with a professional and very accomodating staff.We arrived before check in time, with no problem they gave us our room. A valet drove us to our room and helped us with our bags.We then went to the Oasis Water Park which was a fantstic attraction for both my 3 year old and my 11 month old. We spent both Saturday and Sunday at the waterpark. The lazy river was the hi-light for both children. With Seasonal hours the Oasis was closed the rest of the week so my husband golfed the resorts' course on Monday.He is a pretty avid golfer, golfing at least 3 times a month, and he was pleasantly surprised with this challenging course. It had recently been reseeded so the entire course was flawless. Very impressive course!We were at the resort during their off season, so there were very little crowds anywhere we ventured in the resort. The restaurants were great as well. The Rustlers Roost was a hit with my 3 year old since it is decked out with cowboys, a live bull in the front of the restaurant, and a tin slide in which you can enter the dining area. The Rainforest Cafe is down the street from the Resort, and the Resorts Aunt Chiladas Mexican restaurant had wonderful service and great Mexican food.The workout facility was well equiped and readily available to work out in most parts of the day. We did not have a chance to use the spa facilities.Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the entire resorts', impeccable grounds and efficient staff. We are looking forward to our next stay there.

<Content>Don't leave your bags at the Bell Desk! Just a heads up for anyone who might stay at this hotel. My ipod was stole from my bag which was left with the Bell Desk. Since I had to check out before I actually had to leave the hotel, I left my bags with the bell desk at the front of the hotel. A suitcase and a backpack. A thief went into my backpack and took my ipod. Thinking back, I realize that their bag room is not secure at all. Not only do all the bell men go in and out, but anyone could walk in there. It's not secure at all.I do have to say that the security department at the hotel has been helpful (short of replacing my stolen property).

<Content>We had a nice time We stayed at the AZ Grand after a few very busy days touring through northern AZ so we really wanted a relaxing time. We liked the idea of the golf carts taking you everywhere and they were there right away - of course this was considered off season but we were happy with the response. First nite just did the pool - not heated as they had said - and then room service - VERY expensive, don't know if families could afford it. We had a spa day the next day which was heaven - again expensive but we had one of the packages and I knew in advance the price - it was our treat to ourselves. Went to dinner at Elements - a place the concierge had suggested - beautiful and delicious. My daughter went horseback riding the following day - again they picked her up - and she was impressed with the wrangler an the stables. All in all we enjoyed it and would go back - but would NOT get room service due to the expense.

<Content>A perfect first anniversary weekend, Thank You! My husband and I recently stayed at the Arizona Grand Resort for our first wedding anniversary. We had stayed there before, but this was the first time as the Arizona Grand. We both travel frequently and were just taken aback by our experience on this very special weekend. The grounds and suite were beautiful, and every staff member we encountered from the front desk and concierge, to the housekeeping and Oasis people were extremely friendly and helpful. One example I would like to share; I was searching for an ice machine and found one a distance away from our suite when a nice gentlemen from housekeeping noticed me and showed me where there was one much closer to my suite...I was very impressed by that. Everything was just great, we will never forget our first anniversary and we will be back next year!

<Content>Surprise, this will be thre worst honeymoon ever 1st the waterpark was closed even though the website said it was open, the #1 reason we went. It was 103 degrees and it was closed?2nd after swimming at the small pool that was open, while in the process of changing an employee walked into our room to fill the mini-bar even though we had the do not disturb sign on. We told him to leave.3rd after our second swim and placing the do not distrub sign on the door, my husbands wallet had a $100 bill stolen out of his wallet. We were 2 flights of stairs down and they had the nerve to do it while we were walking down the stairs, as that was the only time our room wasn't in site. We knew it was missing as I had just placed all the dollars in his wallet.4th the bill was slide under the door and reflected a price $50 more than the agreed upon price from cheaprooms.com, plus we were charged the resort fee, when the waterpark wasn't even open. Um...yeah...wanting a getaway honeymoon and traveling from Alaska? Don't go here. Parks limited hours, no privacy, robbed, and then they tried to rob me again with the bill.No thanks.

<Content>Very pleasant stay Arrived early and was immediately taken by golf cart to a nice room with a view. It faced the road but there was very little noise.There were 2 conferences at the resort but they did a fabulous job of keeping them separate.I was in the Sedona building, easy access to everything. There was a waterpark but it was closed. There were pools in the courtyards of all the buildings that were open during my stay.The mandatory resort fee was a little excessive since I didn't use any of the facilities except internet. I let them keep the mini-bar key so there would be no surprise charges.The room was comfortable with a separate bedroom and very tiny bathroom. There were 2 TVs but only one remote - not good if 2 people want to watch TV at the same time.Bathroom was tiny but seemed very clean, lots of fluffy towels. Bed was comfy but the pillows were vary small. One was not enough, two was too many.Overall, a very nice resort and I'd absolutely stay there again.

<Content>The Arizona Grand Resort stinks The place was packed with people. NO parking anywhere near hotel room. Two of our party got very sick at Aunt Chilada's recommended by the hotel. Drunk person banged on our door late in the night. We had to shut the bedroom door to block out the partying noise. At 8:30 am while the two people were still actively sick and we were taking care of their toddler in our adjacent room, housekeeping knocked. I said no thank you. To which the woman said housekeeping again I said NO! And then she proceeded to try to come in with her pass key. 8:30 in the morning?? Check out is noon or something like that. We will NEVER ever go back.

<Content>Kids Loved It Well first of all, we had a wonderful time. The resort was beautiful and the kids loved it. The waterpark was great and kept the children busy for hours. The rooms were spacious due to the living room area. The children loved having two televisions.We booked our vacation through US Airways Vacations. It was the best deal around but more importantly we did not have to pay the resort fee. They did charge us the daily $25 resort fee. However my friend inquired about the fee and another worker told us we should not have been charged because we booked with US Airways and stayed more than 3 nights. They did try to hold $600 on my friends credit card despite the trip being paid in full in advance. Therefore they AGREED to only hold $300.Other than those incidences we had a good time. We did go on the Hummer ride in the desert. We went on a tour of the Grand Canyon and to the western themed town of Raw Hide. The kids loved it all. It was a great vacation.

<Content>Great for Families - Sacrifice on Service We enjoyed our stay at this resort during Labor Day weekend. This is one of those megaresorts that has everything: wave pool, water slides, lazy river, movie by pool side at night, etc. They also offer kids tattoos, animal balloons, and caricature drawings during the day. This resort is ideal for families who want activity, over service. Service was lacking for us. For example, the balloonist at the pool was extremely unfriendly and decided to cut the line in front of my daughter, twenty minutes before the time he said they were closed! This happened to us two days in a row. Hmmm... The bell desk also kept giving away our transportation to someone else, despite the fact that we called each time and made reservations for specific pick up times. The guests who were given our rides told us that they did not. One time, we had to wait 20 minutes for the next car and almost missed our reservations. For the price, this resort was a good deal (our toddler loved it) but I guess for those who want better service, smaller boutique-styled resorts that are more service-oriented are the way to go.If you do give this resort a try, stay in the Camelot or Sedona buildings since they are closest to the water park. Camelot is closer to the spa and Phantom Horse Grill (best restaurant on site, IMO, with a view of the city). Each building has its own adult-only pool and family pool. This was especially nice during those times when the water park was so packed, we couldn鈥檛 find any empty chairs. The food at the Phantom Horse Grill was better than the other restaurants we tried -- nice way to end the evening by enjoying a meal by the firepit with city views. We also tried Aunt Chilada鈥檚, which was pretty good, especially the tacos and chips/salsa. The food at the pool side Oasis was horrible (philly steak sandwich, hotdogs with dried out hard buns, and wings), but I didn鈥檛 expect much since it was convenient and quick. Ruslter鈥檚 Roose offers cowboy-style fare, like fried chicken, ribs, steaks, etc. The food was pretty good there and the dining experience great for families (indoor slide and balloonist, who was extremely friendly and attentive, who made balloons for the kids while you ate). We also ordered room service for breakfast. It was average and really pricey but service was quick. I just wish they offered more options for breakfast at this resort.Also, the resort offers horseback riding if your children are 6 yrs old and up. If not, you can take an 8 mile drive to the Ponderosa Stable where they allow toddlers to ride with parents -- which is what we did. Service at the Ponderosa Stable was spectacular and their rates are unbeatable.

<Content>great for everyone What a great resort! I was a bit nervous about the waterpark because of past experience with gigantic waterparks where I spend the entire time trying to keep an eye on my kids. It was the perfect size. Big enough for the kids to have fun yet small and calm enough for me to relax!Our room in the Camelback section was lovely with nice sheets (my pet peeve!).Only ate in the Mexican restaurant which was really bad and the snack bar at the pool which was good for that type of food. Ordered room service one night and that was average but scored big for quick accurate delivery.With the variety of pools and things to do I think this is a good resort to please most everyone for a reasonable price.

<Content>A little disappointing... We were invited by friends who frequently stay at the Arizona Grand to join them for their annual vacation to Phoenix. The premise seemed good- an all suite hotel with a water park onsite. However, we were slightly disappointed when we got there. Regarding the overall resort, the golf course had been damaged by rain and my husband and son had to skip multiple holes. The driving range was closed altogether. Construction of new vacation homes right in the middle of the property ruined the feel of the resort a bit. The Asian restaurant (that I was most excited to try) was closed for the summer. Regarding the room, it was clean but in need of some maintenance. Also, the only access to the bathroom was through the bedroom, which left a little to be desired in the privacy department.On the upside, the water park was great for kids and very convenient. Also, there were quite a few other regular pools throughout the resort that were convenient and open late. We had a great time at the Rustler's Rooste (a steakhouse) and Aunt Chilada's (the Mexican restaurant)- both onsite as well.

<Content>Loved the Arizona Grand If you are looking for a top notch hotel in Phoenix for the whole family try the Arizona Grand. It is an all suite hotel with lots of great updates. They have a water park called Oasis that the kids will love. It includes giant water slides, a lazy river and wave pool. On the weekends they show movies at night which you can watch from the water which is a good thing as it tends to get pretty hot in Phoenix in the summer. They have numerous great places to eat along with a great health club. To top it off when you have had enough of the water park there are pools throughout the resort that you can enjoy with the onslaught of kids. Good location with a golf course on site. 15 minutes to the airport, 20 minutes from downtown and 20 minutes from Scotsdale. Will for sure go again.S.YoungVancouver, British Columbia

<Content>Great hotel, beware of the 1 RUDE lifeguard though. So I took the familt to the Az grand resort on August 8th, because of the waterpark mostly. Kind of overpriced for the Splash package, was 300 overall after all the charges, but got a 50 rest. credit. Used it at Aunt Chiladas, great food and service. We get there and check in, no problems. We go to the waterpark, and the kids were having a blast, they are 6 and 11. They ride the two big tubes and the serpentine tube lots of times. Anyway, at 2pm they switched lifeguards at the top, and this young,short sandy haired, slightly chubby man about 19 comes on. See...they have a height restriction of 48 inches that the other guards are pretty cool about if you are within a few inches. my daughter is 3'101/2. Anyway, we are in line, and this guy copes a major attitude, jumps out of his chair, very confrontational, and makes my daughter line up to the measuring stick and she is just shy. He says she cant go, and when I try to talk to him about it, he says do you want me to kick you and the kids out of the park? I said...what? and he instructed us to get down that instant! Very unprofessional. Anyway, before I blew my stack and went off on the guy, I decided it wasn't worth it, and took my kids down. My daughter was bawling her eyes out. ..he left at 235 pm., and we rolled right back up and started riding again. Anyway...overall a good time...nice room, very nice beds, a little crowded but hey its the summer. All I would suggest is to get that guy out of working with the public in any capacity...hopefully your kids wont encounter him, he was the only bad one in the whole group of lifeguards...a REALLY bad one. Its a shame how one horrible experience could mess up a trip, but that put a dent on if I will ever go there again, or recommend this hotel.

<Content>Nice family resort Great resort for the money. Paid around 90 dollars through expedia. The staff was nice. But I do have a warning for future travelors. I was aware of the 25 dollar resort charge but no one has ever mentioned the 600 dollar hold they put on your credit card when you check in. Yes I'm not kidding, I've heard of a 200 dollar hold at previous hotels I've stayed at but never this much. Since I was checking in with my visa check card this would have wiped out all the money I had in my account. This wasn't mentioned to me when I checked in and If I hadn't heard another employee telling a customer I would have never known. I did discuss this with the lady a the desk and she talked to her manager and they released 300 dollars off my account. I wish this was mentioned when you checked in and mentioned when you reserve a room online. Overall we loved the resort, great place for family with kids. They did monitor anyone coming in the water park and no one was let in without a arm band. You must eat at the Rustlers Rooste restraunt behind the hotel, great food for a great price.!!

<Content>Great Mini Vacation for a Family We were there Sun. through Tues. It was a mini family vacation for us and it was perfect. We utilized all pools and the cactus kids club. We had a room in the camelback suites that overlooked the oasis waterpark. It was perfect. We took the kids to the Rustler's Rooste which they loved! All the reviews prior to this were helpful! We were also able to get a little shopping in at the Arizona Mills outlet mall. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful!

<Content>Oasis pool area was great This resort was an excellent value as we booked it through Priceline for $100 (bid - Resorts in Tempe, AZ), half of what the hotel's website was asking for. We stayed in the Sedona section, it was very close to the pool area. The suite was excellent. The Oasis had 3 water slides, a lazy river, and a wave (weak) pool. The kids loved it and for the price I would stay again.

<Content>Terrible We expected to have great weekend but we are very disappointed. We stayed at Mountainside. Room was dirty and stinky, very dark, carpet was wet, 鈥渃offee table鈥?and 鈥渘ight stands鈥?painted few times and cracked. Rest of furniture same. Blanket on the bed didn鈥檛 look clean and was ugliest I鈥檝e ever seen. We didn鈥檛 even stay there overnight. Thanks God we live in Phoenix only 30 minutes from there. Water park was ok. Very crowded. Staff was friendly. Don鈥檛 get tempted buy their website. Everything looks great there with taste of luxury, but its only a good pictures.

<Content>Unimpressed We took the kids because we thought they'd enjoy the water park and a nice getaway weekend in nice surroundings, with a great mall across the street. The water park is really the big draw for kids but other than that, this place is really nothing special. It is SO crowded. Parking is almost impossible. We parked on the street (which is still on the grounds) and our vehicle was saturated by the sprinklers. The congestion around the resort and mall, as well as on the grounds was a constant hassle. As for the restaurants, Rustler's Rooste is overcrowded, overpriced, and the service was lousy. Room is OK. Since they cater to families, you'd think they'd have a microwave and fridge, but they don't. Bathroom is very small. Place is noisy, crowded, and a pain to get around. The maid stopped by to clean the room and we were getting ready to leave. She said she'd be back in 1/2 hour. We called housekeeping 8 hours later when we returned to see if we could get the room cleaned. Staff are overwhelmed. The $25 per day resort fee is a joke if you don't use the water park. This place is no resort-- trust me. It's just a massive Embassy Suites without the space, fridge or microwave. Recommended? Only if you get a smokin' deal and are specifically going for the water park. Also, if you don't mind crowds and lots of noise and traffic.

<Content>a wonderful vacation ! Our family just returned from the arizona grand . We were an extended family of 23, ages 4 to 82. The rooms in Camelback were spacious, clean and the beds were spotless and comfortable.We liked the food in all the venues and the staff was always polite and friendly. When I plan a vacation , I prefer the name brand quality I can count on. But when I saw the all suite rooms, the water park, and the south pointe mt that provided hiking trails and the horses we wanted to ride , I took a leap of faith and was so glad I did !

<Content>Great Place! This place was great! It is definitely worth it to pay a little extra for the resort suite. We stayed in the Sedona and it was very close to the water park. If you have little ones through the age of about 10, the water park is perfect! We have two teenagers and they didn't care for the fact that you had to stay in a tube while in the lazy river and on top of that, it moved too slowly. The wave pool had very small waves and they got a little bored with that as well. Overall though, our stay was pleasant. We spent more time in the swimming pool than at the water park. At times we had the whole pool to ourselves. The room was very clean and we didn't hear any outside noise. The beds and pillows were awesome and we loved the shutters in the living area opposed to curtains. The bathroom was a little small but at least the sink area was separate. You may want to request a room that doesn't face west to avoid the afternoon sun. We had to leave our thermostat on 60 (the lowest it would go) and I'm a cold-blooded person. All in all, our stay was pleasant and we would definitely recommend it. Don't forget to eat at the Rustler's Roost up on the hill while you are there...we had the t-bone --.the best steak my husband and I haver ever had in our lifetime! Well worth the price and the view was awesome!

<Content>Great Local Getaway I recently spent a weekend at the Arizona Grand Resort. We were looking for a local hotel with gas prices being so high we didn't want to travel too much.We stayed in the Camelback building which just underwent room re-designs. They were very comfortable, clean and spacious two room suites.The water park is the biggest draw and it was fun for the afternoon. Lots of kids. Overall it was a great way to unwind though. They even had steel drum music before lunch which I love. Reminds me of the Carribbean.The restaurants were varied. Breakfast was just your standard. Chips and salsa were great at the Mexican place and I was actually suprised at how tasty my steak was at the steakhouse. I figured it would be on par with Outback or something because of the whole cowboy theme but was pleasantly suprised.It is a big place so there is some walking involved but you could always call the front desk for a ride.Great gym and spa facilities. And we really enjoyed the horseback riding.Overall the staff was very friendly and helpful. Other people wrote about the construction and we saw that they were building something but never heard construction noises.

<Content>Anything but Grand We came up from Tucson with the two kids to play at the water park, which is the only thing this place has going for it.You are definitely just another tourist in this place and there is very little feeling that you are in a resort. We picked this one because we heard they had a great water park, but I have no desire to return. The water park just isn't that great.On top of that, this is one of those places where you think you are getting a great deal until you actually get here and find out they nickel and dime you for everything and it is all 3 times as expensive as it ought to be. Drinks at the pool are $8. I got the bill today and found I have a $25 resort fee which I never knew I would be paying. This on top of the $20 upgrade they convinced us we must have when we checked in. This was so we could have the new furnishings and wireless. Apparently we would have been in a real dump without the upgrade, next to the freeway and FAR from the water park with old furnishings and no internet.Add to this the fact that the whole place is under construction and you wake up to jack hammers every morning. The staff act as if you are in their way. I shared a guest, not service, elevator with a cart full of what smelled like rotting brocolli yesterday morning at 7:30am. That killed my breakfast appetite.Next time I'll book a hotel near a real water park and skip the attitude.

<Content>Didn't even have to pay and it was just ok My wife's job held a conference at this resort for 3 days. Even though the suite we stayed in was paid for, I thought this was just another average 'overpriced' hotel. There was a ton of construction noise right outside of our balcony which started at 6am. We didn't even want the curtains open, because of the view we had, and the workers had! I thought about having them switch our room, but it was no money out of my pocket, so it didn't bother me so much. It's too bad there is no all-inclusive option at American hotels like this. Everything is so rediculously overpriced! Bottle of water $3, Bottle of Pepsi $3.50, Sun Block $15, 2 Eggs  Sausage $25!The room itself was nice, but not worth the $150/night people are paying for. The bed... very comfortable... but the same bed is available somewhere else for $70/night. Bottom line, if you don't care and have money to just burn on the every day average, you might like this place. I think a rich golfing vacationer might enjoy this place, and a rich family with any age kids who loves the water. I'm not rich, so I won't return to this place if I'm paying for it!

<Content>Nice place. Kids loved it. Stayed here for a few days after our trip to the Grand Canyon. It was a great place to finish out the trip. We had a nice suite facing the Oasis pool area. It's a big place, but easy to get around. Bell hops are glad to take you by golf cart to any of the places you don't want to walk, e.g., Spa or restaurants.Oasis pool area was really nice - not crowded at all when we were there mid-week. Water park closes at 8pm, but two other regular pools/hot tubs stay open until midnight. Phanton Horse Grille was nice place to eat, and kids had a great time at Rustlers Rooste, a western-themed restaurant just up the hill.

<Content>OK time at Arizona Grand Resort Went with the family to the Arizona Grand Resort for the Memorial Day Weekend. Very convenient to the Phoenix airport, about 10 minutes. Also very convenient to the Arizona Mills outlet shopping mall which is about 5 minutes away.This was at one time a well known, but older resort called the Pointe at South Mountain. They have kept much of that facility intact, so despite the newness of some parts of the resort, you can see areas that are dated.They are in the midst of some major building and by next year things will look somewhat different. They are also pushing owning a part of the resort. I have to compliment the staff, they did not push the purchase side of the resort on us at all despite the signs everywhere. There is also a large construction area that was quiet for the weekend, that separates the hotel into two parts, so if you are going to stay here, don't stay at the Camelback or Mountain units--you will have to do a lot of extra walking to get to the pool, the breakfast restaurant, the health club and spa. We stayed at Camelback and found everything to be kind of far away. They do have shuttles to get around if you request them. Staff was friendly and helpful.Room was suite style with pull out queen sofa, desk area, wet bar, TV and separate bedroom with 2 queens, TV, closet cabinet and bathroom with combined shower/tub. Small balcony overlooking construction site--no sitting area. Rooms were kind of noisy with family next door and kids running up the hallway. Internet is wireless and free.Parking was kind of difficult, with nite time parking a search, ended up walking about a block back to our room, as parking in our lot was always full.Lots of activities--Oasis water park, is only open to hotel guests, has an 8 story water slide, water tube area, large pool and a wave pool. Each unit also has a small pool and jacuzzi pool. A golf course and driving range were available. Tennis was available, but I did not see the courts. Gym was very large and spacious. Food for breakfast is available at the restaurant adjacent to the Health club--food was ok, nothing exciting. There are several restaurants on site, only went to the one for breakfast.General atmosphere of the place is lots of families with small kids. Lots of screaming and running around, by the end of the day, the housestaff must have their hands full trying to keep the grounds clean, always lots of snack trails down the hallways and in the common areas. At the pool, they have a lifeguard about every 8 feet!Ok place to stay, but if you do not plan on spending a lot of time at the water park, you could probably stay somewhere else for less money. My kids are teenagers and they thought the pools scene was ok, but overrun with smaller kids. If you have smaller kids, this is the place for you.

<Content>A wonderful Arizona resort I have just returned from a three day stay at the Arizona Grand Resort. I have been to Phoenix many times and have stayed in many hotels however this is truly a resort. Our room was absolutely wonderful for two adults. We had a large living area and a seperate bedroom that was quite large. The bathroom was small but the vanity and sink were located outside the bathroom so it was not a problem. The only complaint that I had abouth our room was the noise level. Our bedroom overlooked a coutyard and beyond that was a garage where the service vehicles for the resort were kept. Early each morning there was a lot of noise and commotion. The food was just OK. I would recommend Flemings Steakhouse for an excellent dinner. It is a few miles south of the resort but well worth the drive.We spent each day at the Oasis water park and enjoyed it. The pool furniture was not clean, however it just needed to be wiped down each day. The pool service was great and they have great SPICY Bloody Marys made with pepper vodka. The spa was wonderful-I had a massage with Bonnie and she was excellent. I used the health club and also walked some of the trails. We really enjoyed our stay at the Arizona Grand despite the noise. We did tell management and they were very open to our suggestions. Our service was first class and the grounds were beautiful. We will return next year.

<Content>Liked it alot. Just avoid the restaurants except for breakfast. Just stayed at Arizona Grand. Here's the summary: rooms are quite nice and renovated. Beds are comfortable and living room is fairly comfortable. A shame that the bathroom/sink area is in the bedroom, and not in the hallway or livingroom area but oh well, not too bad. The water park is excellent for families. Great slides/wave pool/lazy river and lots of fun all day for the kids. Staff there was very nice and pool service was great. Had to watch my daughter because she kept wanting to raise the service flag on the back of her chair and order more smoothies! Lots of lifeguards too so we felt safe with our 7 year old going around the park (4 year old was with us in the pools), and only one exit from the park through a gift shop that kept good control of entry/exit.The restaurants on property, however, were terrible with the exception of breakfast. We for some reason ate at each of them during our stay (from the fine dining to the mexican restaurant shamefully called Aunt Cheladas) and they were all not good at all. Food and service were both well below quality standards and they need a change there. Breakfast was the only nice meal we had.That being said, the overall stay was great and I would certainly return with my family. They had SUCH a good time there. Visit in May and the weather's nice with no crowds. On weekdays we felt like we had the waterpark all to ourselves! Obviously not great for their biz but great for us.

<Content>Overall Good Experience at Arizona Grand Resort Outstanding place to go with family. The water park offers a convenient and easy way to spend time with your kids while you give your spouse a break and when everyone wants to spend time together. The suite-style rooms are helpful...you can put your kid in the living room and the adults stay in the bedroom. Resort suites have two doors - one accessing the living room and the other accessing the bedroom...makes it really easy to sneak in and out if the kids are sleeping.Service was prompt and friendly for hotel services. The food was rather bland except at the Phantom Grill. That is the resort's biggest weak point. The conference business didn't really interfere with our stay...we thought it would but it didn't. If you have small kids, don't hesitate to try this resort. They even have one shallow water pool specifically for small kids and the wave pool offers a gradual entry into the pool too...so small kids can play in 1-foot of water...or less. The three adult slides are EXHILARATING and it's easy to enjoy a cocktail or three while tubing down the lazy river.

<Content>Some issues,yes. But the staff...FANTASTIC. I stayed at the resort from April 25th-27th. First, the good...The room was very clean and had all the items you would want.The actual mattress...extremely comfortable!!!Aunt Chilada's Mexican Restaurant....Muy Bueno! Everything we had there was great and our waiter, Thomas, was fantastic.The Oasis Water Park is clean, well staffed and a fun way to spend the day. There are flags on the back of the lounge chairs that when you want something to drink or eat...you just raise the flag and they'll come running. They were very quick to arrive and very polite. Bring some $$$ though, It can get pricey quick. Think movie concession prices.Caring and helpful staff. I had several complaints, and they addressed them the best they could and were always professional and sympathetic.Now the bad...(in my opinion)There are a lot of kids at this resort. A lot. Noise is a HUGE factor.This may sound weird...but they have the worlds most crunchiest sheets I've ever felt. It was like sleeping under a newspaper. Thank goodness, the bed itself was so comfortable. the pillows are down and they look so nice and fluffy on the bed, but after a minute, its like wearing feather ear-muffs, with the feathers disbursed to each side of your head and your neck on a pancake thin layer of feathers. If you can...bring your pillow from home.The Phantom Horse breakfast buffet...runny eggs and barely cooked sausage...however, in fairness, you can order alacart off the menu and the people who I saw did that, their food looked pretty good. The restuarant has nice atmosphere and great views. The patio would be a great place to eat at sunset.Did i mention how many kids there are at his resort? How they like to run up and down the corridors? Oh, i did? Ok...sorry.Needless to say, my initial stay at the resort was anything but peaceful and restful. It would be nice if the resort had at least one of their buildings designated as adults only for those who are looking for a more relaxed atmosphere.I contacted the General Manager, Paul Gray after my stay to discuss my disappointing weekend at the Grand. He not only listened to my concerns and disappointments. He was very quick to offer a solution and sincerely sounded like he wanted to make right anything that didn't go right the first time. I think that type of personal customer service is rare and because of his follow-up, I'd even give the Grand another chance to impress. Anyone who cares enough to follow-up and try to make things better, is probably someone who cares that you were there in the first place! So, my first stay...not so good, but I'm encouraged, the next time will be better. I'll keep you posted. :O)KW

<Content>Fabulous I'm sorry the last reviewer had a horrible time, but my experience was the complete opposite. We picked the A.G.R. because of the great price ($159 a night) and the waterpark. My husband and I wanted someplace that would keep our 6 year old busy. The waterpark was very clean, the staff extremely friendly and the food  drink were reasonably priced. My only complaint about the waterpark is the waterslides were only for people 48 and taller. While my daughter is a good swimmer, she wasn't tall enough to use the slide and was upset about that. It would've been nice if they had a slide that catered to the smaller children and maybe a playground on the grounds.We stayed in the Camelback building and the suite was completely renovated. There were two heated pools in the courtyard of the Camelback along with a ping pong table. My only complaint about the room is the bathroom was very, very small. It was difficult to close the door unless you were practically standing in the tub and I'm average sized. I can only imagine what a large person has to do. The grounds were beautiful and well tended with flowers, trees, fireplaces and fountains. My daughter and I went to the spa where I had a massage and she had the Pretty Princess package; manicure, pedicure and hairstyling. The staff was professional, courteous and made us feel very comfortable. We had dinner at Rustler's Roost and Aunt Chilada's. Both were good, not spectacular but I didn't expect either of them to be a Michelin rated. I would highly recommend this extremely family friendly resort to just about everyone. However, if you choose this hotel, ask for either the Camelback or Sedona buildings because the Mountainview building isn't going to start being renovated until August.

<Content>you call this a resort?!?! I stayed at this hotel about 3 weeks ago and it was the worst time I have ever had at a hotel before. I had stayed here about 1 and a half years ago and it was the best time my family had ever had. Coming back to this hotel was a disappointment because the staff is very unfriendly and the hotel grounds look horrible. The restaurants on property were absolutely disgusting. I cant believe they call Latitude 30 their fine dining restaurant. It was dead when we walked in there and the food tasted like it was old. the only part of the hotel that was decent was the waterpark and the bar staff there was so friendly. I believe it was Brian and Sam who were our bar staff for the weekend and they were wonderful and made my stay better. I will never come back to this hotel and I hope others never come to this hotel.

<Content>Agree with "thekld" review I generally write lengthy reviews but I agree with thekld from Santa Barbara, California's previous review.We flew into Phoenix and drove to Sedona and the GC so this resort was our last stop prior to going home. I chose it because of the water park and I was not disappointed. We enjoyed 2 nights here relaxing at the water park. My 12 year old son had a blast and this was my husband's favorite place of the trip. Personally I thought the resort was too big but we thoroughly enjoyed the lovely pool area with the gorgeous palm trees and flowering bushes. We also ate at the Phantom Horse and Rustler's Roost which were both good. We had excellent service at the Phantom Horse by Andrew our server and the outdoor fire was a nice relaxing touch to watch from indoors. I liked the decor at the Phantom ranch but the Rustler's Roost was more fun for families with a great view of the city. Take advantage of the free coupon at checkin for the hot cookie which is served in a skillet at the Phantom horse. Now that was one yummy dessert!We hiked a bit of the trail of the South Mountain Park and the golf course looked great. But since we had visited Sedona and the GC I just couldn't get too excited about the scenery.I would highly recommend this resort for the water park and the rooms were very nice too. We liked that it was close to the airport but if you aren't going to fully utilize the waterpark I would choose another spot.

<Content>Great family fun just a short drive from Tucson My husband, 2 kids (12 and 17) and I drove up from Tucson to spend the weekend shopping and visiting relatives. We heard that the Arizona Grand had a fantastic water park and was recently renovated,. so we tried it out. What a pleasant surprise! The hotel staff were all very friendly, the rooms were spacious and comfortable, the location was ideal (lots of shopping nearby) and the waterpark provided hours of fun. We plan to go back frequently over the summer... I'm glad we have such a great vacation destination only 1 1/2 hours away!

<Content>We liked it After reading some bad reviews about the Arizona Grand, I was pleasantly surprised with my stay there. The rooms were very well appointed with comfy beds and clean-feeling bedding as well as a nice separate area with a sofa, work area and kitchenette. My favorite part of the sleeping area was the built-in drawers and closet. The only negative I found in the room was the age of the televisions. I thought the property was beautiful despite the location - directly off an interstate. The water park was fun as were the multiple pools. My only complaint is with the concierge staff who weren't the best I've worked with, but weren't terrible either. The two friendly ladies in the gift shop more than made up for it and should probably take over for the concierge. Overall, I really liked this property and would certainly stay again.

<Content>Pretty bad This Hotel is bizarre. Here on business. Yes - the water park is good if you're into that kind of thing - the beds are comfortable - There are one or two good restaurants in the property - but the neighborhood is crappy, the general layout is really lousy - no central eating-drinking spots - golf front nine is terrible-back nine much nicer. Just stay away-go elsewhere unless you have lots of kids that like a water park and you don't care about your own well-being.

<Content>Kid friendly, overpriced We took a spring break mini-vacation in late March, 2008. The resort is kid friendly, with a large water park with slides, river pool and wave pool. As a result, expect a lot of families with kids. The room was a suite as I think all the rooms are. Bathroom is a little small. We were in the Sedona Building, room 433. Had a view of an interior courtyard even though I requested a pool view. Room was in good condition, but maid service was sketchy. The maid finally showed uo the second day at almost 5pm, so we opted for clean towels only as we had just come back from the pool and wanted to get cleaned up. For some reason the hotel doesn't supply do not disturb signs for the doors. There is construction going on at the property to add buildings. It didn't really bother us. Most room had balconies which are basically un-usable because there is no furniture on them and they are small.Over all, the resort was ok. I don't know that I would call it 4 diamond and I didn't feel it was worth the $300 plus per night I paid.

<Content>The Grand was grand From initial arrival through departure, the hotel staff were helpful, friendly and prompt with all our requests. Camelback rooms were very well appointed and serviced well each day. Some construction going on with new condo units so hotel had numerous drivers to ease movement throughout the property. Special thanks to Mike at the Iron Horse restaurant during the day and Thomas at Aunt Chiladas on Friday. Challenging and enjoyable golf-love the holes up the mountain. Exceptional response to a slightly broken toe during-staff arrived immediately and rendered some preventive care and offered a ride to the ER-back at the restaurant in 2 hours!

<Content>Great family resort Just returned from spring break at the Arizona Grand Resort. We all had a great time. My three boys ages 11, 15, 16 loved the water park. Mom and Dad also enjoyed it. The waiters bring you drinks right to your lounge chairs. The water was heated and the lazy river was refreshing. There are 3 water slides and a wave pool. The room was just refurbished like brand new and the beds were very comfortable. The sofa bed was not comfortable but ok for kids. The location was great , next to Arizona Mills Mall. They have 24 movie theaters and Imax theater, Good restaurants. There is a free shuttle to the mall. We also used the fitness center there it was big . They also offer classes included in the $20 resort fee. I would definitely go to this resort again.

<Content>Good Stay! 2 adults and 1 child (11). We got a room for 169.99 Spring Fling promotion which included $40.00 food credit. The room was 2 room suite with 2 tv's, small bathroom, no fridge or microwave. We were only there for 1 night and never even watched tv so the room was very adiquate for our needs. If we were staying longer I would like a fridge and microwave. The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable and quiet. The balcony was useless, very small and high rail looking out to parking lot. I do not know why the balcony is on that side of the room when nice court yard is on the other side, design flaw. The water park is why we stayed here and it was great, it was not busy and the wave pool, lazy river and pools were all great. Part of the package included the wrist bands for 4 people and a friend of my daughters was also in Arizona so she came to visit and was given a water park pass as well. We also had lunch at the resturant on top of the hill and the luch was really really good and had a $40.00 credit so lunch was free. If you have children this is the place to stay. We also stayed at Pointe Squaw Peak and liked this one better.

<Content>Great Getaway We really enjoyed our recent stay at the Arizona Grand Resort, The accomodations were clean and spacious. My kids found the room comfortable and enjoyed having a TV of their own to watch. During the daytime, the water park was both fun and relaxing. I definitely would recommend the Santa Fe burger for lunch.We found the service to be friendly and personalized starting at check-in and throughout our stay. We are looking forward to staying at the resort again.

<Content>Never written a review before- had to with this I have never written a review at TripAdvisor before but have looked at others before. I am not a person to complain about hotels- generally am happy with what i select but had to write today because for the first time ever I felt dooped by the internet view of this hotel. We came for spring break after a trip to the Grand Canyon and Sedona for some RELAXATION at the end of our trip. The hotel room itself was your standard center hall interior one room suite, problem is that this hotel is literally on highway 10. We had what was considered a good room in the Camelback side of the hotel but if you want to sit on the balcomy you will see the highway, signs for Dennys and Carls junior and hear the roar of the interstate. (luckily we had one side of Camelback that was not under construction but beware that on half of that part of the hotel, the view would literlly be a construction site with cement mixers). Again, i could deal with this if that were the worst, but it was not. For the week before Easter, the hotel was totally unprepared. The Water park is the attraction yet on two days that we were here, they had to close the Lazy River due to lack of life guards. When asked, the only explanation was that they had trouble getting reliable college students to help. While that may be a good excuse sometimes, when it is the week before Easter and I am paying incredible top doller I find that inexcusable. Many at the resort today felt the same way. General consensus of those who had been to the resort before was that it had been better run before and that they had never had an issue with the main attractions of the hotel beingclosed. . Not sure what the issue is but another example of the resort's inabilty to deal with the number of people they had at the hotel was the fact that for the 4 days we were there, we could not rent a movie in the nightime because of overcapacity ( the term used by the receptiinist when asked why the TV did not work). Again, I have never written any review, but felt so strongly that the internet picture of this hotel in this case is just false. There is no view, there is no management of the hotel that is watching the problems and overall this is not a hotel I would recommend to anyone.

<Content>Great Stay I took my family during the Christmas vacation. We had two of the newly remodeled rooms with a beautiful views of the mountains.The reort has something for everyone. My wife and I played golf on their golf course, didn't play well but we had a lot of fun.My granddaughter and kids spent a lot of time at the water park or one of the many pools. The weather was a little cool but all the pools are heated.We ate at two of the restaurants on the resort property and found them to be a good value.The resort is close to some great shopping.All and all we had a great time.
