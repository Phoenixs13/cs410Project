<Content>Needs an administration change It is the first hotel that I see that does not have personnel at the front desk from 11 pm to 7 am, because I had to check out at 5 am and nobody was there to attend me, so the receptionist told me to leave the keys on top of the counter. Another guest was also complaining and then he said Ok, this is not a 5 star hotel, so what should I expect. The first hotel that does not clean your room nor changes towels in a daily basis unless you paid an additional fee of US$5.00 as it said in an information card located in the bathroom. It is unacceptable not to have a hygiene plan. The non-smoking rooms also smelled (stink) to smoke, the sheets, the rug, everything. They need to make sure that the non-smoking rooms don't have this type of odors. No pets should be allowed, because there was a puppy barking all night long and scratching the door the whole night and I called the front desk and nothing was done because I couldn't sleep and then of course there is nobody at the front desk because they left for the day. The shuttle is only available from 8 am to 10 pm, what if I needed the shuttle to go to the airport at 5 am? The hotel is conveniently located near the airport because of people that needs this short distance and type of service. The hotel should provide the driver with a radio to locate him and indicate him that there are clients waiting for him at the airport. The shuttle driver also helps in other cleaning duties. I rented a car with GPS and the address of this hotel is not recognized by the satellite and had to call the hotel and start asking for directions because my GPS was of no help to get there. The hotel should make sure that it's address is available in the GPS. The price paid is extremely expensive compared to the assistance and service received. I definitely do not recommend this hotel to anybody nor would I ever use it again. For this price you get much better hotels around the area. I do recommend a change of administration because the premises of the hotel are good looking.

<Content>Great home away from home This place had small refrigerator, stove, microwave, and coffee maker. It was clean, convenient, and a great price, too. The cleaning/bed making is extra and must be requested. I almost complained but notice the sign to pick up fresh towels at the front desk, which are extremely friendly and accommodating. Again, the price was the best in the area, especially for what you're getting.

<Content>2nd time at this Hotel Booked this room through Priceline for $40.This is our second stay at this hotel, there is another review I did from our August stay.We were alloweed to check in early and our request for a queen room was filled. The room was clean and roomy. My only complaint would be that the bedspread needed to be replaced as it was a bit faded and had a cigarette burn hole on it.We experienced a little bit of noise at night from our upstairs neighbors but not until too late.There are people that have been living at this hotel for over 7 years. We personally saw someone using the luggage cart for groceries. We also smelled cats at one end of the hotel on the first floor.The staff was very friendly and helpful.For the price, the hotel was a good value. It was a place for sleep and it is so centrally located, I always stay in the Doral area for that reason.

<Content>Terrible Experience I would never stay here again, nor would I recommend anyone else to. Our problems started with the hotel shuttle from the airport. After waiting for a half an hour after we called, a van from the hotel finally came to pick us up at about 8:00 in the evening, but our driver, who could not understand much English, proceeded to get lost or confused or both on the way back to the hotel, leading to a bizarre and scary experience for my husband and me. After we had left the airport, our driver said he had to go back to find someone. So he started to go back, but somehow got lost. I asked him if he could please take us to the hotel and then go back to look for the person, but he kept talking, mumbling and driving up and down these dark streets calling and talking to someone on his cell phone. This went on for half an hour and he kept saying he could not understand us and we could not understand him. So we were driving around Miami until we finally ended up back at the airport! I then demanded that he stop and let us out and my husband was actually opening the door before we stopped so that we could get out and get a taxi to the hotel. He could not speak enough English to communicate with us and he gave my husband his cell phone to talk to someone at the hotel, but we had had enough of him and I was too scared to be driving with him at this point, so we took a $25 cab to the hotel. The cab driver was very nice and very concerned that we were at the right place, which was comforting after our scary ride. The girl at the desk refunded our cab and said she could not understand how this could happen, and assured us that he would not be driving the morning shuttle back to the airport the next day. However, she never apologized. The room was ok...no remote for the tv...nothing special, kind of dingy. We ate at Shorty's, next door which was good. The next morning, we couldn't wait to leave and the shuttle showed up at 8:40 when it was promised at 8:00. Again, the guy at the front desk, never apologized. This place is creepy and weird.

<Content>Thieves-R-Us I went outside during my stay to get a swim suit out of my vehicle. When I approached my truck I notice I was walking on glass to soon find out I was a victom of vandalism and theft.Total of 4 vehicles were broken into the night of my stay! The police have been telling the hotel staff to add more lights to the parking lot and they have done nothing!Now this leaves me with a broken window, missing radar detector, golf clubs, bathing suit and shoes. On top of everything I missed my flight.When I finally got a hold of the Hotel Manager she was rude and offering no assistance or discount.Bienvenido a Miami!

<Content>Client Humiliated CLIENT HUMILIATEDI made reservations in EXTENDED STAY AMERICA Hotel Miami-airport AT DORAL, confirmed with the numbers 96546486 and 91407924, to my family for 6 (six) nights from the website Travelnow. (1 room for 2 adults and 2 children and the other room for 2 adults and 1 child) from 16 to 22 of January of 2006.When I arrived at the Hotel to check in at 3 p.m. the front desk personnel (Gustavo Cavalero) said that my reservation in his computer was only for 2 people in each room and that the hotel didn鈥檛 have room with two beds. So, I asked to talk to the manager Raquel Papaterra, who was at the hotel at the time but only came to the reception 40 minutes later. During the time I spent talking to Gustavo Cavalero there was another employee called Sergio who was cleaning the reception and made things worse because he got on our conversation and he was constantly changing his voice tone and trying to intimidate us.One hour later after many attempts to prove to Mr. Gustavo Cavalero through the confirmation print outs from Travelnow and dialing 877-542-7695, with no luck, Mr. Cavalero said that he could give me a room for U$ 195,00 my original price bought through the Internet was U$ 110,00, I did not accept this value. Then, after 30 minutes more of arguments Mr. Cavalero offer the same room for U$ 125,00. Considering that we arrived by car from Orlando to Miami my family, 4 adults and 3 children, were extremely tired, I decided to accept the proposal and try later to get my money back.When everything seemed to be ok the same employee Sergio pass me and said OFFENSIVE words in a voice tone that I and 2 members of my family could listen to, he caused a reaction in our group. We were insulted by the Manager that canceled our reservations and said to leave the hotel. I am sure that is not the way to treat customers. Attached I am sending a copy of my reservation to prove that I was right. I and my family couldn鈥檛 be mistreated like that. This letter was send three times to Extended Stay America central office and they didn鈥檛 answer.Guilherme
