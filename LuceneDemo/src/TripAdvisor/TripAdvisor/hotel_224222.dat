<Content>Long Stay in Dallas I was looking for a place to stay for a month while I was getting certified to be a chiropractor. I called the hotel directly and their rates were competitive compared to the other hotels. I didn't want to spend three grand staying at the hilton for a month. Although it was hard to find, it was a huge room for a good rate. The staff was friendly and helped me find everything I needed in the area. Would stay again.

<Content>Dirty Rooms I am a Technical consultant and travel quite a lot. As such, I have stayed at a number of different hotels, in different cities and states.Initially, I chose this hotel to save money. The manager was able to offer me an excellent rate for an extended stay (few months_ and the rooms seemed fine on the internet.When I arrived there, I was surprised to find that the exterior and lobby were very clean and nice. I had expected much worse for this price. However, my fears were proved right upon entering the room.The furniture was old, the carpet had many large and ugly stains. The carpet itself was not cleaned and on the floor I spotted several ants crawling around. The bathroom was dirty and ugly. Far worse were the walls of the room. They were covered in small stains and dirt of different colors. Horrified, I told them that I was leaving. Its a good thing that I was able to find an available hotel nearby.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. While the price is fine, don't expect anything else. The rooms are cleaned only once a week and probably very badly.

<Content>Nice location and large rooms! We were in Dallas attending a high school semi final game. Go Pflugville Panthers win state! Anyway, I needed a nice motel fairly close to Texas stadium that was big enough and cheap enough for three guys.The motel was great for our purpose, but it a no-frills type of place. Advantages- large room, kitchen (full refridge, stove, microwave) , wireless internet, interior corridor, several entrances so your car is always near, VCR player in room, . Negatives- no continental breakfast, little to no bathroom amenities, shower was difficult to get the proper water temperature, needs more insulation around pipes/bathroom.There were several youngsters in the hotel as well and many of them were hanging around the halls at night when we came in from our night out. We were ok with this because we were all in our 30s. I can imagine that others would be annoyed by this occurrence.I'm normally not that light of a sleeper, but the noise coming from the pipes -irrespective of whether or not it's from your room- was practically unbearable in the morning hours. INSTALL MORE INSTALLATION IN THIS SUBURBAN MOTEL.I will probably stay there again because of the large room, cheap costs, and location. Maybe they will do something about those pipes by then....

<Content>Awful!!!! DO NOT judge a book by it's cover. I saw the pictures and thought, Aw, this looks like a nice place. WRONG!The staff has no regards to customer service. I've got a 8am meeting...but I'm stuck writing this review because I CAN NOT FEAKING SLEEP!!!Maybe I came at a bad time...but there are just people walking UP AND DOWN and stopping on the darn floor (or second floor - I'm on the ground level).The idiots here would not let me change rooms...so here I am...up at night surfing the web...trying to WARN people out there that this place SUCKS!!!You know...I had reservations at a Marriott...I canceled to save $40 bucks...I am SO REGRETTING IT!!

<Content>Really nice rooms This hotel worked out really well. It was really clean and quiet, and the room came with a full kitchen. I stayed for 2 months and got a great rate too. I'll definitely stay again.
