<Content>Good to be back! Our third stay at the Gaudi, a great value hotel with delightful staff. While this hotel is not 5*, nor does it claim to be, it is in a great location, just across from Palau Guell, which rightly justifies the Hotel claiming the Gaudi name! ...and it's only 50 yards to the Ramblas, and then directly opposite Placa Reial. The staff and the location were our reasons for returning, and as they knew that it was our Anniversary, we were given a room on the 6th floor with a massive terrace and a view of the Palau rooftop and chimneys (Wow!) especially good as the Palau Guell is not accessible during renovations......this was made even more special by a welcoming bottle of cava on ice. Excellent start to a great break. The panoramic view from the terrace gives you about 300 degrees coverage of the city rooftops and the hills beyond. If you want top of the range go elsewhere, but if you prefer good service with a smile at a good price, this should be your choice. Thanks again Gaudi.

<Content>Great location Booked this hotel to be close to La Rambla. Couldn't book in until 1400 hours but staff locked away our cases for us. The hotel was ideally situated just off La Rambla so just as we had expected. Had asked for high room with balcony if possible and that's exactly what we got. Had a huge terrace/balcony with direct views of Palau Guell and the ornamental chimneys opposite. Room was good, looked like it had recently been refurbished, air conditioning was very welcome as we definitely needed it as the weather was really hot. We were pleased to find that there were 3 small supermarkets really close to the hotel and also a cash till opposite. We did not find any problem with noise even though we were at the front of the hotel, though the fire alarm did go off at 0540 hours which was a bit of a shock. Breakfast was mostly continental but a few hot items as well. Staff were friendly and helpful and really polite. Only fault was that the small bar in the hotel didn't want to serve after 2300 hours.

<Content>Good Value Hotel This is a good comfortable hotel at an affordable price. Rooms are a reasonable size with excellent ensuite facilities. The hotel is clean and tidy and the beds are comfortable. Staff are helpful and speak some English. The hotel is within about 2 minutes walk of La Rambas. We were originally placed in a room at the front of the hotel and the noise the first night was terrible - it was impossible to sleep. Having read reviews on Trip Advisor we realised that some rooms must be quiet so we asked to change rooms. For the rest of our holiday we were given a room at the back of the hotel. This was very quiet; we did not even hear noise from any other guests. We also had a small balcony. Breakfast is very good consiting of a buffet that includes both English and Continental. We would definately stay here again but would insist that we were given a room at the back of the hotel.

<Content>Hotel doesnt warrant being called Hotel Gaudi really... We only stayed at this hotel for one night before going off on a Med cruise. The public rooms are quaint with some nice Gauid features but it doesnt really justify the name of Hotel Gauid I dont think.The room we had was miniscule although it did have a balcony at the back looking over what can only be described as the view you would least write home about. Dilapidated, falling apart old buildings, with a large police station back yard as the highlight when it came to the view.It was also absolutely bouncing down with rain for the 24 hours we were there so we made no use of the balcony.The bathroom was very nice and then room was probably quite newly done, it was just far too small.The beds were single, when we'd asked for a double bed, but there were actually like sleeping on boards, so more than one night there would have meant a trip to the chiropractor !!Reception staff were pleasant and helpful. and breakfast was very average.We did ring room service to ask for some early morning coffee and this arrived almost as soon as I'd put the phone down, delivered by a pleasant and smiling waitress.Location is also pretty good, and the advantage of being at the back, with the lousy view, was that we didnt notice any street noise.It was too expensive for what you get.

<Content>Hell at Hotel Gaudi Barcelona I have just returned from a trip to Hotel Gaudi earlier today and feel compelled to advise anyone travelling to Barcelona not to stay at this Hotel. I booked a stay for myself and two other family members as part of a surprise Christmas present and I have never been more disappointed in a Hotel or its Staff before. When we checked in on Wednesday 16th January we were told that the Hotel had charged us for the first night of our stay the previous day to ensure that our Visa worked, I was asked to sign payment for the first night prior to seeing the room that the Hotel had allocated to us. When I was booking the Hotel I had added in the comments box that we would like a room with a view if possible - little did I know what I was in for!!The porter brought us up to the 6th floor of the Hotel and into 1 of 2 rooms on this, the top floor. When we entered I was so shocked, firstly one of the beds had not been made so he proceeded to make the bed infront of us, secondly, the heater for the air conditioning wasn't working in the room so a maintenance guy from the Hotel came into the room and proceeded to flick switches on a remote control. The room was not what was shown on the Hotel's website, I know sometimes this happens but this room was like a shack - freezing cold and no hot running water!When we complained the concierge did not want to know, he was very rude and told us he didn't have any spare rooms. We asked for a plug in radiator but were told that there were none available - we ended up sleeping in several layers of clothes in the damp beds and were cold through to our bones the next morning. We went down to reception the following morning and after the porter coming to our room and flicking the switches on the air conditioning and agreeing it was broken we were moved to a brilliant room on the 2nd floor - it was warm with hot water with better beds, we arranged to meet the manager of the hotel the next day to discuss what had happened and to be compensated for the horrible and upsetting start to our holiday. When we met the Manager he told us that because we had asked for the room with a view that basically this is what we could expect - when we replied that there was no hot water or heat in the room he told us the only thing he could do for us would be to organise to send a basket of fruit and bottle of wine/cava to our room - we told him this wasn't good enough but he insisted this was all he could do!Later the fruit was delievered to the room but we refused it (we had seen a basket of fruit being delievered to a room the previous day  we were told by one of the members of staff that a couple had complained a few days previously and that they had been offered the fruit and wine and had been happy with this - it must be a regular occurrence!!)Basically the staff and hotel were awful and although we really enjoyed our 1st trip to Barcelona I would urge you to stay somewhere with professional and helpful staff. We ended up getting a small reduction on our bill for the 1st night - but after having paid over 200 euro for our 1st night and being mistreated as we were a pathetic 25% off didn't go anyway near making up for their inefficiency. Please take my advice and stay away from this Hotel.

<Content>Noisy, noisy, noisy Whoever wrote that this hotel wasn't noisy must have had the privilege of a room to the back of the hotel. We stayed two nights in a room overlooking Nou de la Rambla facing the Gaudi building being renovated across the street. There were noisy revellers in the streets below up until 6.30 in the morning on both nights, just an hour or so before the builders got started on their days work. The windows simply didn't do a good job of excluding noise. If you stay here ask for a room away from the street.

<Content>Muy Bien Gaudi! We came back from a wonderful 7 night stay today and I have to say that you could not wish for a nicer hotel, staff were very helpful, friendly and spoke english, the rooms were clean and spacious, the breakfast varied from traditional continental to english cooked, in fact the only complaint we had was that the air conditioning didn't seem to keep the room cool all of the time. Very central location just off Ramblas but still quiet. opposite Palau Guell which we did not realise is currently closed for major renovation. Try the hotel food for lunch or dinner.

<Content>Great Location This hotel has a great location right off of Las Ramblas. Even though it's so close to Las Ramblas, it's not noisy at all. It's nothing fancy, but it has everything you need for a comfortable stay. I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Average Hotel We have just returned from Barcelona and stayed at the Gaudi Hotel for 4 nights. the hotel is located just off the Ramblas in a street wher there is a bit of building work in progress opposite the hotel. Not an elegant street by any means and quite a lot of hostals and cheaper shops around.The hotel itself was clean, with small rooms, not bad self service breakfasts (cheaper to go to any nearby cafe) whilst Barcelona is not a cheap place to stay, I thought the Gaudi Hotel as very over priced with not a huge amount going for it. The staff were efficient, and hepfull, but I probably wouldn't stay there again given the choice. Our room was on the 1st floor to the rear of the building with views of a very close nearby building and hardly offering any privacy if you wanted to leave the curtains open for natural light.Coming back to the hotel late at night (or in the early hours of the morning) you had to be aware that the 50 metre stretch of road from the Ramblas to the hotel could be quite intimidating with beggars and drunks in abundance. I consider this a fair and unbiased report.

<Content>Barca great, Hotel Gaudi not so great! Great location. Staff pleasant enough. Clean. Had a back room, (advised less noisy), so no view. The room was quite small for a 3 star, but amenities as expected for rating. Breakfast not brilliant for 10 euros plus tax. Here was the big problem; we have never stayed in a hotel that was this noisy, and I'm not referring to street noise. People in the adjacent rooms sounded like they were in our bathroom, the flushing of others' toilets seemed inordinately loud, just the scrape of a chair in the room above was like nails scraping down a blackboard. Listening to other people lovemaking is quite funny the first time, but is a pain when you are trying to sleep. There seemed to be some sort of work going on at early hours of the morning - lots of banging. You may think that I'm exaggerating, but noise doesn't normally bother me as I play drums in a rock band and am half deaf!I would rate the hotel as a high 2 star and would only stay again if there was nothing better.Barca hints:-Don't eat or drink on Las Ramblas. Have a look in the other areas and you'll find it less expensive, less packed and less 'touristy'. The Venus (25 Carrer Avinyo, gothic quarter) is an excellent Catalan style restaurant and very reasonably priced.Watch your bags/personal possessions; nearly every party we spoke to had experienced thieves/pickpockets.Barca was a fantastic city break and will definitely return, there is so much to see and do and it has a great atmosphere.

<Content>Convenient and clean, helpful staff Close to Ramblas and very convenient for most things. I had a room at the back so no view BUT others with rooms at the front said they could be very noisy. On the whole a reasonable hotel, clean and convenient if not luxurious.

<Author>holidays_r_important
<Content>Definitely on my will visit again list If you're looking for somewhere to stay in Barcelona then this is somewhere I'd definitely recommend!!!!!!!!!!!The service was brilliant ... the staff fantastic ... and everywhere was spotlessly clean. AND ... as if the hotel wasn't good enough ... the location was fantastic. It is situated just off the middle of the Ramblas ... which means its quiet enough, but also only less than a minute away from the heart of Barcelona. We got a train direct from the airport and then a metro into the city ... and the hotal was only 3 minutes walk from the metro station. The metro in Barcelona is the best way to get around ... very reasonably priced and feels very safe (unlike some cities I have visited).There's a great cafe / restaurant only a couple of hundred yards away if you don't want to eat in the hotel ............ but I would DEFINITELY recommend the buffet breakfast in the hotel as everything is freshly prepared and theres loads of fresh fruits.All in all this was one of the best hotels I hace stayed in and definitely a good find!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Superb location I recently stayed at the Hotel Gaudi with my nine year old daughter for a three night stay. The hotel itself is set just 20 yards off La Rambla (main pedestrian artery through Barca), about 2/3rds down towards the port end. This location is ideal for siteseeing and the atmosphere of La Rambla! I found the Hote to be modern, very clean ant the staff very helpful (esp Alex on reception). I would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Great Location The Hotel Gaudi is in a great location, staff on reception very helpful. Bedroom was alright but basic. Bathroom not great. Breakfast not very exciting but was adequate.But the location made up for this as we were only a couple of minutes from the Ramblas.A word of warning though watch out for pick pockets on the ramblas and in the fruit market.Also the taxi drivers as ours tried to charge us 50 euros but lucky enough the hotel porter heard what the taxi driver said and told us to only pay him 30 euros.

<Content>Unfriendly Hotel Gaudi We have just returned from a lovely 2 day holiday in Barcelona, and 2 days in Lloret de Mar.Hotel Gaudi in Barcelona is ideally located in the city centre, corner with La Ramblas and within walking distance to marina and main city square. The Hotel Gaudi offers comfortable and clean accommodation however rooms are small and can be uncomfortable for longer stays. There is no Manager available to deal with guests and we had an unpleasant experience with one rude and agressive Receptionist that totally refused to help us and arrange special transportation for us to go to Lloret de Mar. You need a good 5 days to appreciate this beautiful City, however most people speak only Spanish and communication is not easy and most people are reluctant to help. A good travel guide comes handy. The restaurants are of high standard but be prepared to pay. We recommend Hotel Gaudi for its location, however it lacks professional and reliable customer care. The Staff at Hotel Oasis Park in Lloret, on the otherhand, were all welcoming, friendly and efficient.

<Content>Great value We stayed here to celebrate a friends birthday recently. We had 2 family rooms for 3 nights at a great rate. Having stayed at the 4 star Royal a couple of times I wasnt sure what to expect but we were not dissapointed. The rooms were very spacious (ours slept 4) and clean and tidy. We had a terrace that looked out over the hills to Tibidabo and we could see the Olympic monument on Montjuich, (and if you looked down, into the local police station car park and terraces of local apartments) while our friends had a room at the front with a terrace overlooking the roof of the Gaudi Palace opposite.Breakfast was plentiful and good and the staff were friendly and helpful. The only criticism any of us had was the gym. The machines weren't exactly in pristine condition. The price we paid was worth it for the location alone though. Highly recommended.

<Content>Would recommend this hotel Had a double room for 3 nights. Room spotless and comfortable. Had everything you might need apart from tea/coffee making facilities. Room had recently been refurbished. Plumbing a bit noisy. Workmen still working on the same floor as us but as we were out all day so did not interfere with what we were doing. Stayed Friday to Monday so perhaps noise would be worse if we stayed during the week. Booked direct with hotel at Euro 110 per night - definitely better value than a package.Bought very expensive snack at local tapas bar first day but after that found excellent value at Attic restaurant towards top of La Ramblas near to Placa Catalunya - lovely 3 course meal for two with wine under 拢40.

<Content>Impressive WE stayed here for a weekend and had a very enjoyable time. I had contacted the hotel before our stayed and asked for a view of the Palace. Even though the Palau was closed, it was still lovely to have our own terrace. The staff were very friendly and accomodating and the hotel was very central. We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel Gaudi and would go there again.

<Content>very basic definitely not worth the money i paid for it! i booked a package with thomas cook id definitely recommend making your own package as i paid well over the odds. The hotel staff were friendly, however the room was very small and basic with someone elses hairs on the toilet when we arrived, this definitely put me right off! the breakfast is what you expect to recieve. hotel overall-very basic worthy of two stars in my opinion as it is definitely the worst three star hotel ive stayed in.

<Content>wait a while Yes, this hotel is in a great location for a short trip to Barca... but I wouldn't recommend it right now: the 3rd floor is being renovated room by room (banging at 9am and all afternoon) and the 4th floor will be next. AND the lovely Palau Guell opposite will be closed and covered in scaffolding for another 6 months or so. We had a 4th floor room with a terrace and could see the roof of the Palau... just. If you get one of these rooms in a few months time when it's renovated and the Palau is open again, then yes, it'll be really lovely. The staff were friendly on the whole and brought up a complimentary bottle of cava one night as we were celebrating a birthday.Restaurant tips: (i)llantia, C/Brossoli, 5 (in the Born area: great for bars and strolling around at night): excellent value and innovative evening menu, relaxed atmosphere. (ii) Silenus, C/Angels, 8 (in the Raval area, near the hotel) Very arty. Really fabulous and beautifully presented food. Book or get there early and take your credit card!

<Content>Great Location We have just come back from a short stay in the hotel Gaudi, this is the second time we have been to Barcelona in the last few years but the first time we have used this hotel, we will go back again if we get the chance. If you want to be in the middle of Barcelona, try the hotel Gaudi as it鈥檚 in an excellent location just a few seconds walk from the Ramblas. The room we had was clean and the bathroom spotless. Very friendly staff and an excellent breakfast will keep you exploring Barcelona all day and boy is there plenty to look at. A word of caution if you are going to get a taxi from the airport, we got done over by an elderly bandit who was also working as an official taxi driver, he charged us nearly twice the going rate of 25 euros for the trip. The nice man in the hotel explained how much it was going to cost when we returned to the airport and said if we got caught again that we could email him with the drivers number and he would report him, made us feel a bit better.

<Content>Good hotel in a Great Location This is a very good hotel in an excellent location, 30 seconds walk from La Rambla and therefore right in the heart of the street-life both day and night!The room we had was clean and with plenty of space and storage. We were on the 4th floor and had a wonderful view of the Palau the other side of the road. We also had a sun terrace with sunbeds, the weather was so warm we tested them out! Although the street noises were loud one night, they were no more that could be expected in any large and lively city.Breakfast was buffet style and more than adequate with hot and cold foods as well as cereals and a make-it-yourself toast machine. Service was friendly and polite and all staff spoke English. Staff in reception were particularly helpful.Room service is available, the hotel does have a small bar which closes at 11p.m. but you will find plenty of shops and restaurants very close by.

<Content>Perfect position The Hotel Gaudi is in a perfect position for sightseeing in Barcelona. Just off Las Ramblas 5 mins walk from the harbour, 15 mins to the beach, close to the metro and most of the 'must do' tourist spots within easy walking distance.Our room was spotlessly clean, with excellent bathroom facilities. The staff were friendly and we really appreciated the bottle of Cava left in our room by the management when they found out it was our 25th wedding anniversary.Barcelona is a wonderful city and the Hotel Gaudi is a great place to base yourself for a short break.

<Content>A Week At the Gaudi Following a week in Madrid, I was anxious to see Barcelona (Catalonia). The Gaudi was in an EXCELLENT locale -- The accessibility to the Gothic area/sightseeing/shopping/dining was outstanding. The staff was extremely helpful and truly went out of their way to assist. The room was clean, large and provided many towels! The only problem I encountered was the obsessive eagerness by housekeeping to ensure the room was cleaned -- After travel/jet-lag, I just wanted to rest. My attempt at napping was interrupted countless times by housekeeping (knocking and opening my door while a Do Not Disturb sign was posted on the door handle). Oveall the stay was wonderful and the staff excellent. As a single woman, travelling alone, I felt safe and would recommend this hotel highly!

<Content>Fantastic Location, great breakfast!!! My girl friends and I went for a short break to Barcelona to take in the sightes. I booked the hotel over the net so I wasn't quite sure that it would be ok?We were pleasently surprised, we were booked in quickly with a smile, our luggage was taken straight to our room. Also the receptionist gave us discount vouchers for meals in the city.We had booked a quad room and had asked for the room to be high with a view. Sadly the room wasn't with a front view we were at the rear. But having said that the room was very large, very clean and the beds were nicely made up. We had a balcony that over looked the police station and the roof tops of Barcelona.I have booked to go back to Barcelona but at another hotel. Not because we didn't like this one, but because I found a better standard hotel at at a better price, just off the Ramblas. But I would have no hessitation in going back to this hotel again if the was the price was right.

<Content>Back a second time We have stayed at the Hotel Gaudi twice, Recomended by a colleague who had also stayed there twice, well you dont go back a second time if things arn't right do you.. The hotel is superbly situated just 50 yards from the Ramblas, close to many bars and restaurants.Rooms arn't that spacious but you only sleep in them so I dont see that as a big negative point. The breakfast buffet will keep you going all day, and the staff are friendly and helpful. Take note that the Palau Guel opposite the Hotel is currently being refurbished, and not due to re open until November /December 2006.

<Content>Brilliant location - hotel just ok !! Stayed the weekend here for the grand prix.As already stated - fantastic location just off Las Ramblas on a quiet narrow street. Located at the harbour end of Las Ramblas. 5 min walk to underground. Typical 2 and a half star hotel. Rooms very basic, some with large balconies. Breakfast buffet not bad - did the trick. Coffee machine etc.Cost was about 鈧?0 per person sharing for b  b per night. Mixed help from reception - some very helpful, some not !!Would recommend for location not for luxury !!!

<Content>ideal location We have just returned from a three day stay at the Hotel Gaudi,the hotel was clean and comfortable and our triple room was a great size.The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, and spoke excellent english.We asked for a third floor room or above, at the front of the hotel, so we could have a view of the rooftop of the Paull Guell building opposite, and we were given a room on the fourth floor with a perfect view.The location is ideal for the Rambla,Port Vell and the Cathedral,and we would highly recommend The Attic restaurant on the Rambla.All in all a very enjoyable stay.

<Content>Gaudi had definite Pro's and Con's I had a strong reaction- good and bad to this hotel. We were coming from a three star hotel in Paris that was very luxurious, and it just didn't compare well. This hotel had a lot of perks and could be GREAT(as another tripadvisor member had stated- I now know what they mean).The location is wonderful- it is off La Ramblas and close to the coast. A ton to do. Gothic area has shops, food, museums, catherdrals... The coast has aquarium, IMAX maritime museum and is just a great hang out. La Ramblas is hopping ALL the time (which caused quite a bit of noise in the middle of the night- even though we were on the top floor!!)- can't imagine how loud it was on the first few floors.Our room had four single beds and a pack and play crib for our infant. They were accomadating with the baby and even had a pillow for the baby! The room, bathroom and huge patio(with a great view of the city) were all very spacious. It just seemed so plain- and not interesting at all. The beds weren't in great shape and the linens and pillows weren't very nice. There just wasn't anything that seemed luxurious at all. The towels were nice and they cleaned up our room and bathroom everyday- and did a nice job. The lobby is pretty, and the front desk people are very nice!! There was a nice man who seemed to be English at the front desk who was very helpful. The bar was very quaint. The food was great. Breakfast included eggs, bacon(not cooked well- european style), pastries, breads, yougurt, fruit, cereal, toast, jelly, juice, coffee, hot cocoa, and tea. Very extensive. Room service food was good, too = and open till midnight.They do have an internet cafe- that includes one older computer that you can use for a small fee. Good for checking your email. They also have a small gym. Few pieces of older equipment- but have a gym mat to do some stretching and excercises. The worst experience we had was in the garage for the hotel. While my husband was parking the car, we left our stroller next to the attendants booth- who watched us unload all of our stuff. My husband was parking the car- and realized he couldnt get anything out of the car once parked (close quarters)- so that is why he left it at the attendants booth. When he came back to the booth the man stated that he had not seen the stroller and then when my husband continued to ask questions, he said he did not understand. My older child saw that the stroller had been packed up and hid underneath the desk in the booth. We got our stroller back.- but did not leave a very good impression, to say the least. Watch your items and luggage carefully. I wouldn't let it out of your sight- even with the staff. Overall, there were the ups and downs. I think this could be a great hotel if they spent some money furnishing it. They have a lot to work with and a great location!!

<Content>Great Location, loved the Gaudi Hotel I stayed in the Gaudi Hotel, for 7 nights. Our bedroom was on the fourth floor facing out onto the street, fantastic views of a gaudi scupltured rooftop, unfortunately the museum was closed so we were lucky to avail of views. The hotel is very central just off the Rambles, staff very helpful plenty of tips regarding sightseeing, Bedroom cleaned everyday. Be careful walking down the rambles, quite a few strange people hovering around. Do take the tourist bus only way to see all the sights properly. Defintely stay in the Gaudi again

<Content>Great location We have just returned from a 3 night break (14th February) and chose this hotel based on the reviews we had read on tripadvisor.The hotel is superbly located, just literally off La Ramblas, so ideally placed for all the street entertainers and people watching!.The room was reasonably spacious, had a great bathroom and was very clean.The staff were helpful and recommended places to eat etc, especially good Tapas bars.Barcelona was great, and compared to some cities, fairly reasonably priced. It seemed the further away from La Ramblas you were, the cheaper the food and drink was eg 2 baguettes on La Ramblas were 9 euros, shop 5 mins walk away on one of the many side streets were 4 euros!Try a coffee on the top floor of El Corte Ingles department store on Cataluyna plaza, where you can watch the sun set over the city!I would definitely recommend the Hotel Gaudi!

<Content>We're going back! We stayed at the Hotel Gaudi from 13th - 15th February 2005. We had requested a room with a balcony and found our fourth floor view, level with the roof of the Palau Guell and just across a narrow road, absolutely breathtaking. The balcony was also beautifully sunny from dawn until mid afternoon (fine in February but maybe not such a benefit in summer?). The room was large with heaps of storage, the public areas were very pleasant and if the corridors were a bit shabby, who spends time on holiday admiring hotel corridors? The location is terrific, handy for the Ramblas, the Barri Gotic and the Metro and we enjoyed the breakfast.Downside? Twin beds rather than double, hot water failed on last morning. Overall value? It's not cheap (we paid 120 euros per room per night for bb) but hotel accommodation in central Barcelona isn't cheap and we reckon Hotel Gaudi is good value. We look forward to returning.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel, Highly Recommended We (16 of us) have just returned from a fantastic weekend in Barcelona, where we stopped at the Hotel Gaudi. The hotel has a great location just off Las Ramblas and directly opposite the Palau Guell. The hotel was very comfortable and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We all had rooms at the back of the hotel were the view wasn't that great but they were spacious, spotlessly clean and quiet! Went to the Sagrada Familia which was spectacular. It's a must to take the lift to the top of the towers! We were recommended the restuarant Els Quatre Gats which although a little on the expensive side was superb! We would all recommend the Hotel Gaudi and indeed Barcelona to anyone!

<Content>Clean, basic, good value Unimposing entrance and adequate accommodation. Simple but spotlessly clean. Marble bathroom a highlight and completely out of synch with the rest of the hotel. Breakfast more than adequate. Good value and an excellent location, just off Las Ramblas midway between Plaza Catalunya and the port.

<Content>Highly recommended! We stayed here for our Christmas vacation together with our kids. The hotel staff was wonderful, always ready to help and recommended superb restaurants to us at reasonable prices. We were given Room 215 which had 4 beds - a really big room with a big bathroom and indoor corridor, with a balcony - A STEAL FOR THE PRICE ! We paid much more for a smaller room in Italy, we were ecstatic with the room we got. The hotel manager, the receptionists, and the hotel personnel were all courteous, respectful, and just wonderful. The hotel is CENTRALLY LOCATED and you cant ask for more. We will definitely recommend this hotel again and again to anyone who will go to Barcelona ! Dont think twice, get this hotel ! It was a very clean and orderly hotel and we really loved every single day of our stay because of it. Thank you, Hotel Gaudi !

<Content>Good location, if a little overpriced Visited Barcelona 15th - 19th September 2004. Booked for the Hotel Gaudi after a friend had stayed there in 2002 and raved about the view of the Palace Guell across the road. Booked via email, and requested a room with a high floor, with a view of the roof of the Palace, with Gaudi's wonderfully colourful chimneys. While they said they couldn't guarantee this, on booking in we were lucky. The view was fabulous. The Gaudi is very well-placed, just off the Ramblas, you are literally a minute from the Old Town and Plaza Real with its lovely restaurants, and 3 minutes from the Columbus monument, and 10 minutes stroll from Plaza de Catalunya. My only caveats were:1. At 130 Euros a night for 3*, I felt it was a little overpriced.2. Situated just off the Ramblas in the Raval District, it can be quite noisy at night if you leave your window open; fortunately there was a good air conditioning unit in the room.3. The breakfasts, while substantial, were a little infifferent, particularly the cooked selection, bland scrambled egg, 'bacon' and sausages.That said, these are minor points. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend it to anyone. When booking though, ask for a high floor (3rd floor or above) with a Palace view. It's well worth it.

<Content>Loved the Gaudi We stayed at the Hotel Gaudi at the end of April 2004. The room was small but spotlessly clean and well furnished. We were at the back of the hotel so had no view at all but the room was quiet. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was plentiful and delicious and the little cafe bar was a relatively smoke free hideaway for a late night drink.. All in all a wonderful base to see a wonderful city.
