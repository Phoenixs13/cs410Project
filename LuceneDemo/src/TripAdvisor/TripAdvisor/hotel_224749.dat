<Content>No Problems I needed a place to stay asap and they were there for me. My move out date on my other place was 11/07/05, and October just flew by. I went in on the 30 of October and by the 1st I had my keys. Beautiful properity. No problems.

<Content>Worst experience ever My air conditioner unit went out 2 times during the summer and took at least 2-3 days to fix. Very frustrating...staff would not cover hotel expenses during this time either. Two of my visitors cars were stolen or broken into, the entrance gates were always broke (no security), and the complex was extremly crowded. Just an over all uncomfortable stay.
