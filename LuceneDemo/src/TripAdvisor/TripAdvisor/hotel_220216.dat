<Content>Good points and Bad points This is a very pretty area and you cannot really beat the location but there were two significant downsides. Firstly - the room was tiny - really very very small. Secondly - the noise from the street was a huge problem and we couldn't sleep. Even with the windows closed, the noise was unbearable.I would not stay there again.

<Content>noon meal ambiance on hot day was very pleasant although meal was meager/ skimpy and expensive. Crab in sandwich was meager, 'wellington ham and emmentaler cheese  in croque monsieur was a very thin slice of each and very thick bread -with far too many french fries. Meals for 4 of us were not up to standard expected from a Charles Street bistro.

<Content>Perfect Little Hotel Me and my husband had the priviledge of staying in this delightful little hotel for a weekend get-a-away to Boston recently. The location was one of the best parts of this hotel. We were minutes away from stores, restaurants and tons of Boston attractions. The rooms are cozy and well decorated and the staff was wonderful. They were extremely attentive and friendly and by the time we were cheaking out we really felt liek we had made friends. The Bistro was also a fabulous addition to our stay. I enjoyed Roasted Natural Chicken Breast with artichokes, rose finn potatoes and green garlic, by far one of the best dinners I have ever eaten. My husband enjoyed the East Coast Halibut Steak over morel and hen of the woods mushrooms. He brags that it was the best steak he has ever had. Overall, this was a great experience and we look forward to coming back again soon and enjoying another fabulous stay.

<Content>Beautiful Beacon Hill Just got back from a very short trip to Boston which was an add-on part of a trip to a wedding further up state in Massachusetts. I didn't know where to start when booking a hotel in Boston as all the usual websites were giving me big corporate hotels but I wanted something a bit more boutiquey. I couldn't have done better than the Beacon Hill Hotel  Bistro. For a start, Beacon Hill is without doubt the most beautiful place to stay in Boston. It has a lovely old-world charm and walking along the cobbled stones amongst the beautiful houses and niche shops, with the gas lamps alit, really makes you feel relaxed and like you're on holiday! Have a walk round the corner to Louisburg Square - the houses are fantastic, apparently this is where John Kerry lives.Back to the hotel... what can i say it's very pretty, staff are incredibly attentive. Agree that the rooms are small, although similarly to others we were out exploring most of the time, but I would think if you're here for more than a couple days that you would need more wardrobe space than is provided. However the room is well equipped with all you need despite the size. On arrival our TV was not working properly, but the staff soon had someone in to look at it while we went out and it was fixed on our return.We only ate breakfast in the Bistro, which was complimentary with our stay and it was very good - i had the pancakes, with extra bacon  my husband had the waffles and we shared some fruit - it was all beautifully presented and very tasty - a good set up to our day's exploring! The following morning we had a very early start to the airport and the staff had prepared us some bagels and cream cheese to take with us!As for Boston, we found it to be a fairly small city - we walked everywhere! Shopping is limited so I wouldnt' recommend it for a shopping trip, but if you like history it's a definite! We did the duck tour which was fun, lots of walking and were going to do the MIT tour but it was closed as it was Veteran's Day. As for eating - if you like shellfish you will be in heaven! We tried the Union Oyster House - the oldest restaurant in Boston and my husband was in heaven over the lobster. My prawns were also gorgeous! On our second evening we went for a fine dining experience at Antonys Pier 4 on the harbourside. This restaurant has old school charm and there is a whole wall of photos of famous people who have eaten here - Liz Taylor, The Kennedy's etc! The seafood here was fabulous - you can see the live lobsters and they are HUGE! We both felt thoroughly stuffed when we left and it was super value - $120 including tax and 20% service, which included king prawns for starter (for both of us), whole lobster for him and Sole stuffed with lobster for me. Jacket potoates, salads, breads etc and drinks (although no alcoholic drinks).Overall I would say The Beacon HIll HOtel  Bistro is the perfect base for exploring Boston.

<Content>Lovely hotel, but don't order the duck! A wonderful boutique hotel in a super area in Boston. Rooms are a bit small, and slightly noisy at times (from the street), but it is a fantastic place to stay for location and service. It has an excellent restaurant attached, which provides an extensive breakfast menu (included in room charge). Evening menu is great, seems to be well subscribed to by local residents. But don't order the duck - it's a bit anaemic, leading to a rather bland dining experience - though other meals, chicken/steak/fish are much better( based on one meal experience only!) Would definitely stay here again. (Also has free internet access........!)

<Content>Great Location Beacon Hill Hotel is in a great location in one of Bostons best neighborhoods. We walked every where we went without any trouble. The Hotel is small but delivers top notch service. Rooms are a little small, but are comfortable, besides with such a great city we spent very little time in the room. The rates at first seemed high, but Boston Hotels are very pricey and it turned out to be the cheapest rate of the Hotels we considered. Breakfast comes with your stay and it was 5 star made to order in the Bistro. Hint, do not bring a car to Boston you do not need one, there's no where to park, and if you do not know the city, driving here is not for the faint of heart.

<Content>Great Small Boutique Hotel Stayed in Room 202. Quite adequate. Great shower and towels. Internet Service was out. They worked really hard to get it back up and running. Oh well, Starbucks only a half a block up the street. Very charmiing hotel. The hotel staff and the wait staff were very accomodating. Nice third floor terrace for a late evening bottle of wine. They were wonderful. The rooms are clean. Great location. We've stayed all over the world. This hotel holds it's own. Our hats off to the Beacon Hill Hotel and Bistro. Location is terrific. Just off Boston Commons. Accross from the trendy Upper Crust. Easy walking distance to everything. When the touristy food establishments were packed, we went back to the Beacon Hill and had a great meal (If you want a burger joint, this is not the place--We're talking Arugala/tangerine/mozzarella salad, etc.) Good wine selection. The bottom line, we'd stay there again. What a great neighborhood to wonder around in. And it is a wonderful neighborhood. We'll be back.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed for one night on our way to Martha's Vineyard. We've been to Boston before so didn't feel the need to stay longer (had a fabulous meal at Bricco's in North End!). We stayed in one of the Queen rooms. The room wasn't that big but made good use of space (ironing board folds out from cupboard, LCD TV on wall) and most importantly was clean, although the carpet was beginning to show signs of age. The bathroom was spotless and well equipped (a real plus for my wife!). What we really loved was the character of the room. We've stayed at hotels twice the price and they are just modern and sterile. The downstairs bar was small and inviting with good range of wines, beers and spirits considering it's size. All the staff were helpful, courteous, efficient, and friendly (unfortunately often a rarity these days). Nothing was too much trouble. We enjoyed our stay so much we are cutting our Vineyard trip by 1 day to return for a last night in Boston before returning to the UK.

<Content>Great place We loved the location on Beacon Hill which is right in the middle of everything. The hotel is small and we got to know all the staff within the few days we were there. Benson (the manager) was very knowledgeable about the city and helped get us great restaurant reservations. The rooms are not big but we didn't care since we were there to walk around the city. The sitting room on the second floor and the third floor terrace gave us the extra space we needed to relax. The bar was great with many locals and Chelsea (the bartender) was fun to talk to. We would definitely stay here if we come back to Boston
