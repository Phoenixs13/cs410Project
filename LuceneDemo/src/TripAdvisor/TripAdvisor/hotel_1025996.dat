<Content>good value, excellent overall Me and the miss's were very happy with this apartment (we booked the 1 bedroom deluxe for 5 nights). Rooms were very large and location was good as a JR line train station was within a minute walk (which was then itself a minutes ride from Shinjuku station). The rooms were also very clean and I found the front desk very helpful.Was also a bonus to have a washing machine and dryer as we had already been half way through our trip (and three quarter way through our clothes).Would definitely stay here again though I admit the breakfast left a lot to be desired.

<Content>No satisfaction at all My wife and I stayed at Fraser Shinjuku for 3 nights. Unfortunately, their service was not satisfying us. We moved to Oakwood Shinjuku with just a 10-minute walk from the Fraser. Oakwood was much much better than Fraser.Our room was assigned in a normal room with a small kitchen. Bathroom was average, but the amenity was small. Housekeeping was not working here. Our room was unclean.Front reception agent was friendly, however, their hospitality was much lower than I expected. When we checked in at desk, I heard many voices and laughing from the front back. Some agents worked with no smile. The information cabinet was not well-organized. I saw a lady talking loudly to a guest. She looked very angry. Fraser was not a great mid-class hotel. It was an economy and budget hotel.

<Content>Fabulous and Convenient place to stay The rooms are big for the price I paid. The Sharp LCD TV and BOSE stereo were excellent. The kitchen is small and more of a white elephant. The bathroom is big, bath tub is adequate size.The hotel is on top of a 24 hours TESCO so getting supplies are easy. If you exit at the north end of the OKUBO station the hotel is less than a 100 meter or a 2mins walk. The front office staff speaks English are always on hand to help.My room (1901) have a good view of the tokyo skyline.The breakfast spread was a bit boring, however the cafes has 2 internet terminal for guests to use.Highly recommended.

<Content>Fantastic, loved it, want to go back This was our best accommodation on a 6-week overseas holiday, in terms of value for money, space, and quality of apartment. As a family of 5, we booked a 2-bedroom deluxe (room 504). Everything about the apartment was great. Our beds were lovely, a good sized bathroom, a washer-dryer combination (love those machines!!), the kids loved the fancy Japanese push-button toilet, and having so much space in the living room area to relax was a godsend. In terms of location, the building itself was very modern and secure, right next door to a Tesco's supermarket, and a short walk to the train station (and only one stop from Shinjuku). We also have to commend the staff, particularly the wonderful attention to detail and care shown by the booking staff in the lead-up to our arrival.A special tip (as we discovered) for those arriving on the Narita Express from the airport. Do not try to walk here from Shinjuku station (at least not with three kids and luggage!). This hotel has been recently re-named so the taxi driver we finally grabbed did not understand initially. Suggest you get the hotel name and location written in Japanese on a card to present to the driver, or the hotel phone number which they can punch into their GPS to locate the hotel. In hindsight knowing what we do now about the train network, when arriving at Shinjuku we would recommend catching the metro one more stop to Okubu Station on the JR line. That's how we left.
