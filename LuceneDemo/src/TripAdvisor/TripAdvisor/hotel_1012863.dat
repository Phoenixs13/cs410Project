<Content>Perfect place for holidays We stayed 8 days with our family, divided in three cabins. The personnel is very friendly, the restaurant veeery gooood! It is a pleasure to have a drink in the bar terrace enjoying the lake view. the cabins are well clean, the furniture is beautiful, good tv size with cable, but the best part is the lake view from the cabin. Can visit different places in town and in the night, on Christmas time, can enjoy the town plaza great decorations! We were looking for a quality time with our family and had it. Right now we are making a reservation for next week.
