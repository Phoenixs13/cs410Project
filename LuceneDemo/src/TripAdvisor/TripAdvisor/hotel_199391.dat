<Content>Prinz turns out to be a frog my wife and I searched this hotels website and it looke lovely. On arrival we were given a small pokey rom with a smell of drains right next to a main railwy junction. I was awakened by trains at four am and a train went over the points every two minuites after that. We complained and were moved to a smaller room above the bins. The shower room was about five feet by five with an even more smelly drain in the floor. there was one lamp on the wall above the bed suggesting it was realy a single room. It was quieter but nothing like the rooms on the hotels own website.I brought this to the hotel manager who said that these rooms did exist! He did offer a second move but I thought three moves with no guarantee of improvement was a waste of time. We liked Berlin but I would be wary of the star rating system. This four star room would not be acceptable in a half decent bed and breakfast in my opinion. I had paid in full at the time of booking in May which is the only reason we stayed. So beware of this too.

<Content>easter break Hotel was in good location - quiet but with easy access to bus stop and metro. Room was comfortable and breakfast good. Hotel was very quiet - staff were not friendly and did not show any interest in us as guests ... even whilst speaking to us the reception staff stopped to speak to other her guests without any comment/apology to us. Not friendly apart from the housemaid!

<Content>Had a lovely stay Have just spent four nights at the Kronprinz and really enjoyed it. Would echo much of what has already been said, although a little out of Berlin it is served by several u and S Bahn lines including the S41 and S42 which are circle lines covering a hugh area of Berlin, travel from the hotel is extremly easy making its quite location no problem and something of an asseet.On arrive at the hotel we were greated by name, all staff were very friendly and what was nice was we saw the same faces over all of our stay. Most staff had good levels of English, perhaps a problem as we really wanted our eldest daughter to practice her German!!!The hotel was extremely clean and comfortable, it is furnished in an older style so may not be to the liking of some travellers, this reflects the age of the building having been built in the 19th Century. Our room did not have A/C but would note that the area is quite so windows can be opened.One note of caution which has not been whooly made clear in previous posts, the hotel only serves breakfast - which was very pleasant, and no other meals. There are many eating places locally and eating out is not that expensive in Berlin. Also if you enjoy sitting in hotel bars, especially at weekends, this hotel may not be the one for you as its bar is only open on weekdays, although drinks can be purchased via the night staff.Please read the hotels website, it reflects accurately what the hotel has to offer.We had a lovely stay in Berlin, it is truly an interesting city and one well worth visiting, our stay was enhanced by a pleasant hotel. If we were to return to Berlin we would happily stay in this hotel again.If you would like to contact me for further details my email address is christaylor@blueyonder.co.uk.Chris TaylorBristol England

<Content>Enjoyed the stay Stayed there for a weekend trip. We drove to Berlin. Ample free parking outside the hotel. he hotel is in a quiet street but very close to public transportations. We didnt drive around, we took the bus to explore the city.The staff is friendly and helpful. Nice breakfast. Clean room and really nice and spacious bathroom. Only note of caution, the room did not have any ac. So in summer months might be a problem. Otherwise highly recommended.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed here for two nights during the World Cup last month. I was a bit worried about some online comments I had read about this hotel being out of the way. While it is located in a quiet neighborhood on the Ku'damn the great German public transport system (Die Bahn) makes this a non-issue. Its practically across the street from Halansee station so you can get around quite easily. There was also regular bus service right outside the hotel on the Ku'damn.  There are many restaurants and bakeries close-by in walking distance. I would recommend ArayaThai-excellent Thai food just down/across the street and there was also a Greek restaurant that opened late and served huge portions (Sorry I forget the name now). Lots of little bars and shops around as well. The hotel itself was very cozy. The rooms were a little larger than in other European countries but still not large as in the US. The neighborhood was indeed very quiet. The staff all spoke fairly good English and was helpful and very accommodating. I don't recall the rooms being air-conditioned. We slept with the windows open and that was fine.The breakfast was quite assorted-sliced meats, bread, eggs, cereal, sausages (of course)  fresh fruit. No complaints here. I would definitely stay here again or recommend this to someone looking for a quiet hotel in Berlin with some old world charm.

<Content>A very pleasant place to stay I'm late in comenting on our stay at the Kronprinz since I have just discovered TripAdvisor. But we were so pleased with our stay there last summer that I want to encourage others to try this hotel even though it may seem out of the way.This was our first trip to Berlin, and I nearly cancelled our reservations when I realized how far from the main sites it is; that would have been a bad mistake. With Berlin's great user friendly transport system nothing is far away; the Kronprinz is less than 5 mins from the U-Bahn station and from a bus stop where busses to all parts of the city stop every few minutes. Though cabs seemed readily available, we travelled everywhere, night and day, by bus or train. So don't let the location deter you. It is actually an advantage to be away from the more hectic areas, and there were a number of restaurants within easy walking distance.As for the hotel itself, we had an very pleasant room -- adequate size PLUS a sunny alcove with chaise, table and chairs. Bath was smallish, but modern and clean. The staff was very helpful and friendly.

<Content>A City Oasis My husband and I have just arrived back from our Easter break in Berlin. I am a light sleeper so a quiet hotel is a must. A challenge though for a city break. The Kronprinz Hotel did not disappoint. The Hotel is in a renovated characterful Townhouse built in 1894 and is situated in a quiet residential street on the edge of Charlottenburg in West Berlin. It is five minute walk from the S Bahn and only a 15 minute drive from Tegal airport- bliss! We stayed in a standard double room with ensuite shower. The room was of average size but the bathroom on the small side. To give you an idea, the shower tray and toilet doubled as perches for our toilet bag when not otherwise in use! However this was more than compensated for by the peace and quiet and the friendly who patiently helped these dizzy tourists locate locate our long list of places to visit and made any necessary reservations. Breakfast was buffet style and included a generous selection of cereals, fruit, cold meats, cheeses and yummy German bread.We had a wonderful time in Berlin and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting some repose from the hub bub of City life.
