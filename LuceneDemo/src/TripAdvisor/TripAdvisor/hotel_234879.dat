<Content>Very Comfortable  I stayed here for Christmas  New Year's Eve 2004. I found it a very pleasant and comfortable hotel. Mind you at that time it lacked a restaurant or bar but drinks and snacks may be purchased at reception and enjoyed either in your room or in the nice enclosed garden room. The staff was extremely pleasant and courteous.It located in a very safe part of town and there were always taxis parked out front to whisk you whereever you desired. The only problem I encountered was returning to the hotel from the western part of Berlin, many taxi drivers couldn't find it (mind you, my German is extremely poor) I later learnt that it might be helpful if you asked for specific directions (get them to write it down for you) from reception.All in all, it was a very comfortable above average budget hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel in Hip Area My daughter and I shared a twin room for 5 nights. It was rather small, but clean and comfortable. The only problem was that it faced the front street and was quite noisy, as taxi stand is below. The windows blocked the noise, but needed to be open, as it was hot.We asked for a room facing the back, which would have been nice, but they were full. Lovely hotel, generous breakfast, nice solarium/ garden area. Staff very friendly and helpful. We will return, and ask for a back room.
