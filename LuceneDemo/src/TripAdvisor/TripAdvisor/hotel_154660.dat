<Content>Terrible Service from a Brand Hotel Let's start with the good. It is a cheap ($60 on Priceline), nice, clean and modern hotel located in a relativly central part of Mexico City. There is purified running water, strong showers and late-night room service. If you are looking for a comfortable and clean place to sleep, this will do fine.However, that is where it ends. The service at the hotel is terrible, leaning into the territory of absurd. For example, I called the front desk 6 times over a period of 4 hours asking for an extra pillow, which never came! The next day, when houskeeping took my TV remote control I had to ask - yes, this is true - no less than 10 times for a replacement remote. When I went down to the front desk for the final time he actually pulled a remote out from a drawer and gave it to me. Why he didn't do that hours ago, I have no idea. And my room service debacle isn't even worth mentioning. On the plus side, I did become fluent in Spanish when it comes pillows and remotes!The location of the hotel is ok, but not great. If you are driving it is near the highways and it doesn't take long to get to the airport, even in rush hour. However, it's a very grimy area that shuts down at night so you'll need to order room service in order to eat. Even the subway station is a 15 minute walk.There are many nicer hotels in Mexico City that are similiar in price, with better locations and service. So avoid this one if you can.

<Content>Not your average Radisson... As a first trip to Mexico City, I didn't know any better...Colleagues were surprised we were booked in here - it has a reputation locally of hiring out rooms by the hour !Also be very careful to use taxis approved by the hotel - although that is a general rule in Mexico City as per warnings given out by the US Embassy.On the upside, the rooms were well appointed with quality fittings and were spacious, if rather dated. Breakfasts were also good.However, I won't be staying here again - it does not deserve 4 star status.

<Content>Room Service Issues I stayed at the Radisson Hotel Flamingos only for one night with a friend. The room was nice, but YES the bellboys go knock on your door in such imprudent times to tell you they need money. In my case I asked for room service food, they brought it and I signed the ticket for them to charge it to the room, until here everything was ok, aproximately a half hour later here comes a bellboy knocking on my door to tell me (almost yelling) that I don't have any credit, what the hell does he mean with that?? at the moment I was getting dressed and in such a hurry, that I couldn't even open the door to try to talk with this stupid guy. So I yelled back at him that I would pay at the Lobby desk. He left.When I checked out the next morning at 6 am to go to the airport, I go to the desk to pay my ticket, and trust that the guy is doing everythink correctly.Then the friend who was with me in the room checked out at 1 pm and she got charged again for what I've ordered and already payed. She thought that I forgot so she payed. Too bad.This tells me that maybe the guy who charged me was so asleep or something but that he couldn't do things right! and nobody cares!I think they are incompetent and have no prudence at all.Currently I'm trying to solve this with the Hotel.

<Content>Fair for the price I booked online through priceline and got a great rate for this hotel $75USD. The check-in was very efficient and and although I stayed only one night every contact with the staff was positive. My room was generally clean although the toilet appeared to have not been thouroughly cleaned. The fixtures were moodern and in good working order. My room was on the first floor facing the street. The traffic was very noisey throughout the night and sound insolation was poor. If noise bothers you do not stay in a room facing the street! I was looking for a safe, clean hotel for one night as I was flying out the next day This hotel met those needs. There was a safe in the room for my camera and I was just able to fit my small laptop in there also. The area was not very convenient to the places that I wanted to see, Reforma and Zona Rosa, although the hotel hailed a cab for me and for about 95 pesos I was taken to Zona Rosa. I could not see that the surrounding area had any restaurants or stores within walking distance, although I did not ask or investigate thouroughly secondary to time restraints. Because of this I ate breakfast in the hotel which was fair, but failry expensive -- 140 pesos for a buffet. I personally would pay a bit more for a hotel in a different area if I were to return. I had no problem getting to the airport in about 40 minutes the next day and the fare was about 175 pesos.

<Content>Give the Flamingos a chance I was very skeptical given the prior reviews. I must say, though, the staff was extremely helpful. Maybe they have been briefed in a meeting that they needed to kick up the service. Maybe they fired all those people and hired new ones. Whatever happened, it worked. The entire staff was entirely accomodating on whatever you may need. The location is not the best but there is a metro station about three blocks down that is very accessible. The buffet is great and has lots of choices! I would suggest including it in the room rate. I would definitely stay at this hotel again for my next stay in Mexico City.

<Content>Wish there was a better hotel in neighborhood We have stayed at this hotel 3 times due to its convenient location. The hotel is modern and clean, but the staff is rude and incompetent. For 2 of our 3 stays, the reservations could not be found or were for a different price than we were given on the hotel's website and on our confirmation. For one stay, the hotel was prepaid and we had to pay a second time and work it out through the credit card company when we returned home. The front desk staff was put-off that they had to help us. Bell boys woke us at 1:30 am requesting money for bottled water (very suspicious) and another night at 4:30 am with a newspaper. Why are the bellboys knocking at doors in the middle of the night? We mentioned it to the front desk and they remarked that it must have been a mistake... two nights in a row!

<Content>Should you book the Radisson Flamingos? The answer would be.....Yes, only if you didnt find any other place to stay! Because, trust me, there has to be many other great places to stay in Mexico City, than this hotel. I had a talent competition on September 2004 with Intermodel 2004. The place where me and my group stayed at was this particular hotel. At one time, one of the workers was rude to me, just because i was asking him if he had seen my glasses around, since i had dropped them, and he was simply rude and ignored me. Another thing is that since i was from the States, they did not treat me like they would treat others that originated from Mexico. I belive it was unfair treatment. In other words, my stay there was not all that great.

<Content>Zero interest in customer satisfaction Typical business class hotel but I went to two banquet events there in the past year. At the first, besides god awful service, I was ripped off by the hotel valet parkers who slipped me a ticket showing me as arriving early in the AM, rather than in the PM and thus charging me 4 times the rate I should have paid. At the next, I ordered a bottle of wine that was down right rancid, awful smell, no legs, discolored, cork floating all over the place. The waiter got the head of banquets who sniffed and tasted it and told me that Beaujolais is a full bodied strong wine and I must not be accustomed to the taste. When I told him that it is actually supposed to be a lighter red wine and fresh, he dismissed me, refused to change the bottle and charged for it and was sure to add the tip to the bill before presenting it to me so that I could not take revenge. This place should be closed down or clausurado as we say here for incompetent staff who rob its clientele, rather than serve them. God knows where the manager is when such things go on. My only two visits to this hotel and I will never return - I would rather dine at McDonald's for higher quality service and food than their four star claim.
