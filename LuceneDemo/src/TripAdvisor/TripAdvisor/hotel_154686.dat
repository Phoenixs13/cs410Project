<Content>Very Pleased When I booked this hotel, I didn't know what to expect, but i must confess i was very impressed with the hotel overall. great rooms, very large, in my case i had a double bed, and there was a separate living area and minibar. Live Piano music every afternoon in the huge atrium. the restaurant there is average but four blocks away there is Old Town Tlanepantla and the food there is great and cheap. pleasently surprised for being a crown plaza

<Content>Perfectly good hotel for northern Mexico City Located in the northern part of Mexico City, just outside the city limits, the hotel is very nice. Check-in was efficient and the lobby and public areas were clean. The lobby is in a hige atrium which adds spaciousness to the experience.The room was very large, even by American standards. The beds were comfortable and the staff excellent.If I were forced to be critical, I'd say that TV channel choices were limited for non-Spanish speakers. CNN and Fox News was about it. There was a movie channel and I was thrilled to watch Kumar and Harold go to White Castle. You too can get lucky.The area around the hotel is run down. I couldn't get a straight answer from anyone on the safety of the surrounding area. I rollerbladed early one morning and found it perfectly OK.I'd also say that the buffet breakfast is just average. Service is great and the coffee was good. I tried, eggs and bacon but didn't finish them. The yogurt worked though.The biggest surprise was the weather. I don't know what I was expecting but it was very cool for July. Mid-high 70's during the day and mid-low 60s at night.
