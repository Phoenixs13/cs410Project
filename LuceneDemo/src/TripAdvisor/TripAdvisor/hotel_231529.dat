<Content>nice little hotel, interesting TV Viewing We stayed for just one night and found this hotel to be friendly, cheap, clean and comfortable. It is situated about 10 minutes from the city by Metro and then another 5 minutes up a small hill. Its in a neighbourhood with not a great deal of shops around. the room was nice and the staff were very helpful. The TV has a movie channel (canal) but be warned that late at night time it turns into a free hard core X rated porn channel. We were quite surprised at this. We highly recomend (the hotel)

<Content>Enjoyed We've been travelling with a friend and were not sure that we will get a decent hotel. As soon as I learned which one was ours I've used Trip advisor. Thanks to those who has given their comments!I also liked the hotel - my friend even more as she is not travelling much due to limitation of money. We are in our early fifties.The hotel is situated in a very nice vicinity - for well-off people - and the area is clean and quiet. I've noticed cafe and market there nearby (just to the left on the first crossing going in the direction to the metro). Metro is close and less than 10 min to Catalunia square.The room for two was nice - rather big, cleaned regularly . Though it was out to the street - rather quiet - not much traffic (compared to Moscow not to mention the exhaust gases in Moscow).Breakfast was quite big, but as we were staying in the hotel for a week it is rather monotonous, but tasty anyhow.Dinner was quite nice and the wine excellent and cheap (I compare to Moscow, of course!)Recommend it to anyone though for youngsters it might be bouring there!

<Content>Calm and Quiet We really enjoyed this place. It's in a quiet, residential neighborhood, very close to the metro which will take you to Pl Catalnuya in less than 10 mins. There's not much in the quiet, upscale neighborhood around the hotel, but there are two pleasant cafes around the corner for cafe con leche and tasty croissants and sandwiches as well as a small fruit shop and a large supermarket nearby, a bit hidden but convenient for snacks, etc. Finally, 2 small restaurants by the metro station serve quite good food outside in a calm, relaxed style. This is not the tourist ring. The rooms are not large, but well appointed and well maintained. Note, there is no business center and no internet places nearby. The staff is friendly and very helpful with assistance and directions. The Tres Torres was a welcome respite at the end of long hectic days of sightseeing.

<Content>Good experience! It seems kinda far from the airport but a close distance to the center of town. A very short walk to the Metro. The room was very nice and the staff was very pleasant and helpful.
