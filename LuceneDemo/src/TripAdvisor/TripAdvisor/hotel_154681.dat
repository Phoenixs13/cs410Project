<Content>Terrible Experience It was loud at night, and the staff did not care. The food was mediocre. I had a different price written on my check-in card when I checked out than when I checked in. I asked the clerk about the change. I鈥檝e never seen a hotel clerk with anything like his reaction. I have never been in a situation like what then happened in my life. He was aggressive, insulting and he threatened me. He had the bell hop lock me in the lobby. It was early morning and I was alone. My wife arrived, and after some more yelling and tension, a second person arrived. He brought peace to the situation.

<Content>nice but... it a nice place, very well located. the rooms are just the average room everywhere. but with no AC , no purified water, awfull shampoo ( really smells bad ) , you can hear all kind of noises, children running by the hall , children screaming , etc... i mean , its nice and clean , too clean actually that all the towels smells like bleach , actually all the bathroom smells like bleach , and i hate bleach. anyway , if you wanna be close to Zona rosa and all the gay lifestyle , go on , the good thing about this place is that is really cheap , and ... well located , ohhh i told you that already , aright , just try it .

<Content>Disappointed Read the reviews, and was aware of the hotel from several visits to the City. First the room was too warm (Unusually warm for November) I asked twice for a fan for the room - no luck. I was told their was air-conditioning, but it only worked for about 4 hours over 4 days - and too noisy. No controls in the room.No menu for room service. No bottled water. No (Labeled) purified water faucets. Bathroom too small. I am a frequent traveler to Mexico city and have had much better at lower prices.

<Content>Excellent place to stay... Excellent place to stay!!!! Pricewise, too good for the location and service. Really nice staff (Luis, Julian, Gabriel and Luis D.). Hotels across the street are twice the price for who knows what kind of service. Good meals/service/price at the restaurant, valet parking (don't forget to tip the bus boy when he/she brings the car out). Hot water, separated water valve with purified drinking water. Air conditioning in the room but controlled from the lobby (stayed 6 nights, didn't work 1 entire night and then was turned off around 3 in the morning for 2 nights). Currency exchange at the lobby up to $100.00 USD. Convenience store open 24 hrs just around the corner (Oxxo). (------------------------------------------------------- Ave. Chapultepec runs right in front, Glorieta de los insurgentes one block away and Monumento a la Independencia - El Angel, just 4 blocks away. Definitely, will stay here again. Had problems but not related to the hotel. Driving around the city SUCK... street signs covered by tree branches and people giving you wrong directions. Once I got off the airplane, in the gate area was told by security officer to put away my video camera (not allow to take pictures or use video camera at the gate area). Also, I was victim of Police bribe, but since I was prepare for I got away with it (sense of satisfation).

<Content>top bargain for zona rosa area Its a very good deal. Friendly staff, steps to subway. Ask for one of the rooms with a king size bed, which are much bigger than the other ones. It is very close to Zona Rosa and police station, but does not feel as safe at night as hotels actually in the Zona Rosa.

<Content>Great Hotel for the price!!! I have recently stayed at SEgovia twice in the last 6 mos. This is a great find!!! great price, service,and most of all, across the street from Zona Rosa(pink zone) entertainment/shopping area.The food is good, but I recommend let the staff know you are there as sometimes if busy they may be slow in service. The staff is very helpful.Enjoy it!!!

<Content>Low rates by the Zona Rosa! The Hotel Segovia Regency is a nice hotel just across the street (Avenue Chapultepec) from the Zona Rosa (Pink Zone). The hotels in the Zona Rosa Cost two or three times as much as the Hotel Segovia even though they are just across the street. It costs about 60.00$ U.S. per night go to their web site and get a 10% discount. I like the Hotel Segovia Regency because the employees make it a career of working here. They are professional, kind, courteous, and friendly. They are their to assist in your every need.In May 2002 there were numerous burglaries from the hotel room safes. I was one of them. The hotel manager and the front desk managers were very helpful in assisting me in contacting the police, moving rooms, and whatever else I needed. I filed the proper police reports and a claim with the hotel's insurance company. After approximately three months the insurance company reimbursed me the cash that was stolen from the safe. Any and all documentation, receipts, letters from witnesses, and photos you can copy and give them is very helpful. Because I use traveler's checks my vacation was not ruined, those were easily reimbursable. My credit cards on the other hand took some time. The credit card companines are not always able to do what they advertise, so beward of high expectations of these companies.You are probably wondering why I am reccomending the Hotel Segovia Regency. I have been staying with them since 1990 and I have stayed with them two times since this loss occurred. The people who work here make it a great hotel. I will continue to stay here.Bad things do happen to good people. So the best advice is to be prepared and have a plan in case something bad, no matter what it is does happen.Note, in Mexico if the crime is not in progress you go to the Police Station and file a report, then they come and investigate it. While it is time consuming this is how it is done.I would rate the rooms as well kept and clean. If you are travelling alone and like spacious spend about $10 more a night and get a double, it is worth the money.The food in the resturant is good. Although there are many fine resturants in Mexico City, an afternoon snack or a late dinner at the hotel resturant will hit the spot. A late night mocha or expresso is always good here, especially with a shot of Khalua. The hotel resturant is open till 11 p.m. The menu offers many choices with some being perpared very well, while some others I did not care for because it is not how I would prepare it.The room service is good, although sometimes the communication gap between my broken Spanish and their broken English does not always produce what I like. If you order cream with your coffee or tea it may be hot cream. Be sure to explain what you want and how you would like it. If it needs to be cold tell them, if you want it plain tell them. And if it is not perfect when it arrives they will fix it to meet your desires.While it is not the newest, nor the most modern the Hotel Segovia is a good place to stay. For those of you who like a nice hotel, central to everything, and with a wonderful staff the Hotel Segovia Regency is the place to stay.George Peter Hanzas!
