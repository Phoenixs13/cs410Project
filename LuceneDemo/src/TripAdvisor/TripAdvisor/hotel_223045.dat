<Content>Next door to sex clubs!!!!!!! You have to drive by massage parlors, strip joints and condom stores. Not great for the family.On our first night 4 cars had their windows smashed and were broken into. The manager stated the computer was not working and that is why there was no video from the security cameras. We believe they were fake security cameras. We were told by managment that there was a gang hitting the hotel parking lots.The pool area - the hot tub was not working and we were unable to see the bottom of the pool in the shallow end. We didn't let our daughter swim in the pool.The elevator was broken for one day. The breakfast was laid out very early in the am and was supposed to run until 0930. When something ran out - it was out (coffee!) Good luck finding help.Housekeeping knocked on the door before 0830 every morning (we stayed 3 days during spring break.) They did restock, however, they turned off the air conditioning everyday - average temp 80-85 degrees,This is definitely NOT a 3 star hotel, possibly a 1 star. If you are looking for a cleanish room and are not afraid of having your car windows smashed and are not bothered by strip joints,etc...by all means stay here - we won't be coming back.

<Content>Not all the reviews said this.... I was looking for a good deal on a hotel near the American Airlines Center. We were going to a concert with our kids and were excited about it. I read the reviews on hotels.com for this hotel and it sounded like it was a great hotel at a wonderful price. No one ever said that this hotel is in a part of Dallas that used to be nice, but is going downhill fast. There were at least 4 strip clubs in a half-mile radius as well as a sex shop that we had to drive past to get to the hotel. Had I known that, I would definitely have chosen a different hotel.

<Content>Cockroach in our room! We had a cockroach in our room on the last night we were there. It wasn't dead yet, and we contacted the front desk. Their response was that they couldn't do anything for an hour until housekeeping arrived. We contacted the 1-800 number for Country Inns  Suites who had the front desk person come up to apologize to us. Customer Service called us today, but really didn't seem to care about our complaint. They made excuses for the way we were treated! Needless to say, we will never stay at another Country Inn  Suites! Find a chain who cares about their customers!
