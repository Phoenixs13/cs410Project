<Content>Good little hotel The Ludwig van Beethoven is a great hotel for those on a budget, yet wanting something clean and suitable for couples or families.We had a triple room, a really good size, small bathroom but separate toilet, so made it easier.The room was quite warm because of the afternoon sun, we asked for a fan, it was delivered to the room without any fuss.The breakfast is probably one of the best we've had at a similar three star hotel in Europe - great variety including cereals, fresh fruit and pastries, all served in a bright, airy room overlooking a pretty coutyard.The staff were really helpful with giving directions, suggestions for restaurants, etc. There is a wonderful Vietnamese restaurant just a few doors away, don't miss it, also a good Greek restaurant nearby.The subway and buses are really close to the hotel, it takes a while to get to the city but it's a nice experience by bus, you get to see so much of the suburbs.There are supermarkets and cafes all within a few hundred metres of the hotel.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is happy to be a little bit away from the sights, but wants a clean, comfortable experience.

<Content>Great Breakfast We stayed at the Ludwig Van Beethoven in May of 2007. The hotel was excellent and definitely exceeded my expectations having stayed in some *interesting* places in Europe previously. Arriving at the hotel via the very closeby U7/U8 lines it was easy to get to and had a 24 hr reception. The staff all spoke english and were very helpful the entire time of our stay - helping us to track down a pub showing a particular sporting event and answering several queries.The hotel room was very clean and large with a great shower. Every morning there was a huge buffet breakfast spread out from 7am - 10am. This included salmon, parma ham, other meat cuts, a variety of cheeses, fruit, cereals etc. (This was included as part of our booking although I believe that they sometimes charge this separately).Near the hotel are numerous shops including a large department store, a supermarket (be warned it does not take credit cards), and several restaurants. I would definitely recommend the Vietnamese place just along from the hotel (Hamy Cafe). We just ordered the specials off the board which were delivered within about 2 minutes and were incredibly tasty.I would not hesitate to reccomend this hotel and would definitely stay there if visiting Berlin again.

<Content>Comfortable stays I have stayed comfortably several times at this hotel. Karstadt Departmant store is very nearby where amongst other things one can get good inexpensive meals and a view from the excellent roof top self service restaurant.
