<Content>Just like being in a friend's house Stayed three nights in this great hotel. Great location near the Ku'damm. Owners and all staff really friendly and very welcoming on arrival, including welcome drink. The whole place feels like home from comfortable home. We had keys to main front door, hotel front door and our room naturally. We had room 5 which was terrific and very spacious. Splendid shower after walking our socks off round this enormous, fascinating town. Breakfasts were delicious. Loads of tourist info and suggestions from the owners as to how and what to see. Honesty Bar open whenever we got back. We recommend going in December with all the wonderful Christmas Markets including the gluhwein and wonderful street decorations - makes London look v. boring in comparison. All in all a wonderful city beak in a lovely small and intimate hotel.

<Content>Wonderful boutique hotel My husband and i had a great stay at the Hotel Art Nouveau last summer. The owners of the small property are very friendly and go out of their way to help you with your travel plans. The hotel is close to the train line, that can take you to Brandenburg gate, reichstag and other key sites. The hotel is in a mostly residential neighorhood, which is full of great restaurants. There is a german pub across the street and an Italian restaurant around the corner. There is a gas station/convenience store adjacent to the hotel, which was great to pick up a map, drinks, or snacks. The hotel is on the fourth floor of an old art nouveau building. You take a lovely antique lift to the hotel. The breakfast was really nice. Cereals, breads, meats, cheeses, juices, all the standard European fare. One great thing, is in the afternoon and at night, the breakfast room has an honor system. They have wine, beer and other drinks in their fridge. You just write down what you had and they charge it to your room. Plus normal prices! We had a very comfortable room with ensuite bathroom. The room had an antique chest in it with wooden floors. Lovely large windows that opened up to the back of the property. The only downside of this place and it wasn't their fault, was that we were there during a heatwave and it was unbelieveably hot. Like most hotels in Europe, that aren't business class, they don't have airconditioning or fans. They have a simple computer with free internet. Wasn't working very well when we were there, but i am sure it's fine now. Otherwise a great stay and i would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Charming, friendly Berlin headquarters The combination of location, style, charm, value and warmth of welcome have made the Art Nouveau my Berlin headquarters for the past 10 years. HIgh ceilings, spacious rooms, big windows, hardwood floors, and interesting art. If you're there to enjoy the city, owners Christine and Gerd Schlenzka will point you in the right direction. They know all the neighborhood restaurants (many good ones) and Christine stays current on Berlin's vibrant art scene. On my last visit they recommended a special lunch deal at the Michelin-starred restaurant in the Swissotel. It was an extrordinary 3-course meal for about 25 euros. They also sent us to Rogacki, a fabulous Berlin seafood bar known only to locals. Very off the beaten path and inexpensive. Example: three fresh Normandy oysters and a generous glass of white wine for a mere 7 euros. I saw quibbles in a previous post about small TVs, no fresh juice, and lukewarm coffee. If those things are really important go to one of the boring, impersonal chain hotels where you'll pay an extra 20 euros for breakfast...but the TV will be good. I've been traveling frequently in Germany for 30 years. This place is a gem...a throwback. Soon all the family-owned hotels will be run out of busines by the Mercures and Novotels of the world. BTW, my coffee's always been hot.

<Content>Doesn't Live Up To The Hype Recognizing that hotel experiences are highly subjective and that many of the reviews of Hotel Art Nouveau are positive, I wanted to share our mediocre experience. I'm not really sure why the hotel is named what it is. I noted a couple of art nouveau pieces, but the only item in our room that clearly was of that period was a single nightstand. Everything else is, well, just a hodgepodge of disparate styles.We stayed in the suite called Peter for a week. It's the strangest suite I've been in. One enters through the kitchen and the fold-out bed/sitting room is in the kitchen as well. Looking at the floor plan in the breakfast room, I noticed that some of the regular rooms were larger than our suite. Also, if you stay in Peter, don't plan to sleep past 8:00 during the week. There is an elementary school next door and the kids raise quite a racket first thing in the morning. If 8:00 is your wake up time, no need for an alarm clock. Closing the double windows blocks out the noise pretty well, but then you lose the fresh air.The breakfast buffet is okay. I've had better and worse.The owners had some very good restaurant recommendations and we liked the neighborhood. Pretty easy to get around by train, subway or bus.So, overall, I rate our experience here as average which was disappointing. My expectations were higher based on others' reviews.

<Content>A Warm Hotel and a Great Staff The hotel is like staying in somebody's beautiful apartment; the hosts are so friendly  helpful if you need them or fancy a chat, but they don't intrude if you would rather be left alone. Wonderful breakfast and honor bar, and the pillows  duvets are some of the best things about the hotel. The only thing I missed was an actual bath, after lots of walking a soak would have been relaxing but the hot power shower almost made up for it. We booked this through a fantastic hotel booking website called Tablet Hotels, which is very well designed and easy to use.

<Content>Chilly Outside and Warm Inside Stayed for 4 nights in November and while the weather in Berlin was snowy and cold, the atmosphere in this hotel was just the opposite. The owners are great -- they provided a warm welcome and great tips for a first trip to Berlin. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is a lovely neighborhood with many local restaurants and excellent shopping. The rooms are comfortable -- it feels more like a BB than a city hotel. I plan to return to Berlin and this hotel when the weather is just a bit warmer!

<Content>We'll Be Back Spent 4 nights here with another couple for our annual city-break together. Need much longer to see the best of Berlin, so we'll be back. Well placed in old Western part, just off Ku'damm, and close to S-Bahn and access to other parts of Berlin, Schoenefeld and Potsdam. Access by the hall and 30s-style lift to the 4th floor is a taster of what's to come. Chic rooms in art nouveau style were very comfortable. BB only, but friendly owners very knowledgeable on the many good local restaurants within minutes' walk, equally helpful on what to do come rain or shine. Honesty bar, well stocked with good but inexpensive German beer and wine. Being BB, no lounge area but that would really have been a bonus. Excellent value.

<Content>My home from home in the Berlin :-) This is one of the most enjoyable hotel stays I've had!Why? Because it didn't feel like I was staying in a hotel! This is a lovely old Jugendstil or Art Nouveau building (hence the name) with more character than any hotel chain would ever offer you. The Schlenzkas give you freedom to have your stay largely on your own terms and do not charge the earth for it either. We stayed in the Red 'Christina' Suite which was just perfect in every way for us. A good sized living room with wonderful chaise longue and modern bathroom and a bedroom to die for - all minimalistically furnished with a mix of classic antique and modern pieces , but with ample storage space and a stunning bed. Unlike many hotels, we were not pushed into the breakfast room before 9AM and on to the street by 10 by the cleaners - instead you could have breakfast any time up to 10:30 and the cleaning staff came to service the room when it was convenient for you to have it done!I'd recommend it to anyone looking to slow the pace of their trip down and relax into life in Berlin. With great local restaurants like Tavola Calda and the numerous options on offer in the bustling Savigny Platz and it's off-shoot streets only 10 minutes walk away, you are never far away from your brunch or evening meal! Another 15 minutes on the S-Bahn takes you to Hackescher Markt where your evening can really get into full swing.I'll be back in Berlin soon and I'll be back at Hotel Art Nouveau!!

<Content>Excellent Value. Caring Owners. We spent three nights at Hotel Art Nouveau in July. It's located on the 4th floor of a lovely, restored art nouveau building just off the Ku'damn, near alot of good restaurants and stores. Safe, upscale neighborhood. The owners are very friendly, helpful and generous. The breakfast room offers free coffee, tea and snacks 24/7, and an honor bar (reasonably priced). The only downside is no air conditioning, but heat waves are rare in Berlin. The rooms are comfortably but do vary in size and design, so it's better to request a specific room from their website. We would not hesitate to stay again.

<Content>Attention!!! The Hotel is mediocre on all the aspects. Decoration has nothing to see with art nouveau. Very expensive for what it offers. This hotel occupies only two floors of a old building. I have many doubts on the origin of the positive reviews produced about this hotel in the InterNet... The category is of a pension one * or ** maximum!!!!!!It is my opinion and the opinion of others that also were in this hotel.A scandal...

<Content>A little haven of peace and tranquillity 10th March 2005 A lovely, family run hotel in an accessible part of Berlin. My husband and I went for birthday celebrations and the hotel and staff could not have been more helpful....even though we arrived in the middle of a big tourist convention in Berlin. After getting lost on the train system they guided us to the hotel and even opened a bottle of wine on out arrival. Their honesty bar is a legend and the standard of breakfast is second to none. The rooms are spacious and elegant and very comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Warm hospitality amidst the snow During our mid-February trip, the snow fell on Berlin. We had the added pleasure of staying at the Art Nouveau, where the owners warm hospitality, coupled with the spacious and beautifully designed room, made it a trip to remember. Quite simply the perfect base from which to see the City.

<Content>Gorgeous room Lovely, huge room. Breakfasts great. We loved the antique lift with the iron gates that you have to close and the location was nice if a little off the beaten track. Staff are a bit odd though. We asked if they could book us a table at a restaurant that we had chosen. They seemed a bit put out that we didn't ask for their recommendations. When we arrived at the restaurant there was no reservation and when we got back to the hotel they never mentioned it. Still a very good value and lovely hotel. Just avoid the staff!

<Content>Personalised, contemporary rooms. Just returned from our second visit to Art Nouveau (Easter 2004). All rooms beautifully styled and personalised with pictures and orniments -feels like staying in a friend's home rather than a hotel. Great dining room for continental breakfast and lots of good 'happening' restaurants and bars within easy walking distance for supper.

<Content>Great hotel and great hosts We very much enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Art Nouveau. The rooms were clean and warm (we were there in January) and have a cool eclectic mix of furniture, lamps, and art. Breakfast was super - fresh fruit, cheeses and meats, jams, breads, coffee, juice. Beer, wine, schnapps and soft drinks are available at any time and you are on the honor system to record what you drink. It is convenient to the Ubahn and to the bus lines. We were at the hotel in less than a half hour from leaving the airport. We look forward to staying here again.

<Content>Great hotel in Berlin's best neighborhood First read about this hotel in Gem眉tlichkeit, The Travel Letter for Germany, Austria  Switzerland. It was absolutely right on the mark. Wonderful, high-ceiling, airy rooms with hardwood floors; knowledgeable, helpful management (they know all the good restaurants); super location in Savigny Platz neighborhood. One of the suites, #16, has to be one of the best hotel rooms (and best deals) in Berlin; two big rooms, stereo, CD player, TV in each room, huge bed, and very quiet on inner courtyard. Have stayed there half a dozen times and am always well-treated.* (*I am bewildered by the earlier review claiming deceptive financial practices. The owners are straight-up people. I have canceled by phone a couple of times and gotten a full refund.)

<Content>Beware - unscrupulous business practices! I feel it is important to warn travelers about deciding to stay at the Hotel Art Nouveau in Berlin based on our experience: My husband and I were traveling to Germany for our wedding, and we wanted to stay one night in Berlin with my parents. After reading reviews, we made reservations at the Hotel Art Nouveau. Fifteen days before we were suppose to stay at the hotel, our plans changed, and my husband immediately called to cancel our reservations. The staff person (who later we believe was the Hotel Art Nouveau owner) said, Good! Thank you for calling and letting us know and we hope you will stay with us later. There was no discussion that we needed to follow-up with a written cancellation and we trusted all would be well.However, our next creditcard statement included a charge for $250 for both rooms we had reserved. We contacted the Hotel Art Noveau. The owner immediately told us we had no proof of ever calling. When we contacted the phone company and provided proof of a call on the date we had told him we had cancelled, he said that proving that we called did not provide proof that we had cancelled the rooms.The Hotel Art Nouveau owner also told us to look on their Web site and at the bottom of their emails where it says in small writing all cancellations must be written HOWEVER, while all other reservation information is in English and German, the written requirement is only in German at the very bottom of each screen not easy to find. When we pointed out this fact, the owner agreed it was misleading and said that he would no longer communicate with us about the charge.Our concern is how many non-German-speaking travelers have made reservations with the Hotel Art Noveau and then cancelled by phone only later to be charged for their rooms and then forced to pay ..... I warn all those who seek to stay at the Hotel Art Noveau to be extremely careful and not become victims to unscrupulous business practices.
