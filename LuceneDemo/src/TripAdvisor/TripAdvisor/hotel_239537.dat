<Content>sooooooooooooo bad wed site pictures for this place looked really nice and so inviting,but its all a lies. yes the sheets and towels are clean but thats it. the room it really crappy far to hot even for december and no you can not turn the heating off. bathroom so bad shower hanging off wall and no hot water at night plus sockets not working anywhere and although great location very noisy all day and night. when i say great location i mean very central but also great for the local scumbags who took delight in mugging us after only being there for two hours. so please be carefull you thought we were

<Content>Bitten badly by Bed Bugs I was very dissappointed with this hotel, not only with the attack I had on my body by the bed bugs, but by the reaction from the staff. They said it was something i ate but when i got back home i had to go to the doctor and the doc confirmed it was bed bugs.

<Content>Dissapointing 4 days experience Dissapointing experience. ..What was good: an excelent location, quite clean (I mean: clean bathroom and bedroom, fresh towels and linien every two days,just some black hair on the bathroom floor when we arrived,grrr) and that's all really... What wasn't good: a small, dark room with a window with a view on the grey walls and other windows, almost no sunlight!. But maybe it was a luck because the street outside of the hotel is very noisy.No TV or radio, just very bacics in the room. A shower wasn't in the shower cabin but in the bath.None speaks English in the hotel.

<Content>Inexpensive and Great Location Found this place by chance after trying to extend my stay in Barcelona and not having room at my current 3 star hotel. The hotel is only a few minute walk from La Rambla just off a square by the cathedral  very close to Jaume I metro stop. Got a 50 euro rate for a week (friend who'd stayed the week before got a bit lower, but she likes to bargin and I don't). Apparently the floor I was on was recently remodled, didn't really look like much but the room was clean, had a balcony and had it's own bathroom and TV. Didn't have any noise issues, but I was near the top of the hotel. Recommend this place for a low budget choice near the sights, but don't expect any frills, even a hairdryer.

<Content>Dump but cheap! Just returned from three nights at this hotel. It really is a dump, shower stuck on boiling hot (had to walk down a floor to a friends room for a shower), no in-room facilities at all, uncomfy beds (large spring sticking out of the mattress), very thin walls and clueless staff.It's a good job I was on a stag do and was drunk all day and night as it would have been unbearable when sober.Two very good things about the place though: 1. It's a top location and really central and 2. It's dirt cheap.Only stay here if you want to have a bed to collapse in at the end of the day and you're skint!

<Content>basic but really enjoyed my stay This hotel is basic but the beds were comfy and the rooms clean.We had a little wrought iron balcony were you can peer down and the people below. The is a small lift which was alittle noisy at night.I loved this hotel, its very spanish and is in a really good location. It was super value and we found the staff friendly and helpful. When we booked in we found it was only a 3 bed room when we had requested a 4. They found us another 1 bed room no problem even thou they were fully booked as there was a mobile phone conference on. There is no added extras or breakfast no television or hairdryer but what are you doing in spain watching the telly!For a family of 4 it is ideal we paid 拢175. for 4 nights which was a lot cheaper than any where else I could find.

<Content>Avoid like the plague (which you might get!) This was a major disappointment! Aside from the ultra-thin walls that allowed us to be serenaded by VERY loud snoring from the next room, we were bitten by bedbugs (or worse)  suffered for days after. We asked to be moved to a different room, but they thought that was funny. The location was fine, but everything about the hotel was awful. When we arrived, after traveling for nearly 24 hours, they would not let us check in early, though we were sure the room was available. The front desk staff was bored  rude. We are not picky -- we've stayed in many basic hotels  have been satisfied, but this was the only bad hotel we've ever had in Spain.

<Content>No extras but good location Small and simple (no breakfast) but clean and eating facilities within almost every 100mtrs, drink and snack vending machine is in the lobby... It is in the centre of the Gotic Quater and only few blocks from the Ramblas. No extras but convenient if you're on low budget and just need a place to sleep.

<Content>Great Place To Stay My group and i stayed at the hotel for a long weekend, it was a great place to stay right in the centre of everything. It was clean and the bed was really comfy. There were bells that rang every hour and some of the rooms were woken by the bells but my partner and i were not bothered by it. there was a bit of noise but it didnt bother me. There was a bar round the back of the hotel called the hugo bar. they are all spanish but understand a little english. This became our local for the holiday as they were very friendly. And the things they had on desplay that looked like cornish pasties were very nice. deffinatly worth trying. It was a short walk from the hotel to les ramblas, but if you go keep an eye on your bags and pockets as alot of people had problems on there. thankfully non of my group were caught out. The metro system is right next to the hotel it was 1.20 euro for a single trip and it will take you to almost anywere in the barcelona ramblas area. Overall the hotel was very good. there were alot of bars tapas bars and pubs around. you just need to look down all the diffrent ginnles to find them. if you are going i am sure you will like it.

<Content>Clean and Simple The hotel room was very simple with basic furniture, saying that the bed (double) was very comfortable and we slept well. No TV, Radio, or Hairdryer etc. The room was cleaned every day (we stayed 3 nts) and we had clean towels every day. The room was quite noisy being above the road, but the balcony and wooden shutters added to the charm. We didn't pay a fortune to stay here so we didn't expect much and were pleasantly surprised. The location is great - right in the center of the Gothic Quarter - we walked to Guell Park and the Sagrada Familia, the old Catheredral is right on the door step. I would stay there again.

<Content>Excellent location Just returned from my trip to Barcelona and stayed at Rey Jaime 1 hotel which has an excellent central location.Within walking distance you find some of the important attractions of Barcelona and it's also near the Plaza cataluna where you can take the metro or bus to anywhere in Barcelona. Very basic hotel and small but always clean,there are two buildings the main one where you find the reception desk and one right across the street which is condition is not as good as the main building but the rooms very well preserved and modern furniture. No TV or radio. For those who are going exclusively to explore Barcelona and just need a nice clean place to sleep and take a shower i would definetely recommend it.

<Content>I think its haunted! We stayed at the Rey Don Jaume 1, in the gothic quarter in oct 05. The room we were given was huge, could of easily fitted 12 or so beds in! It was basic but that was reflected in the price. The room had two balconies, a tv, and a clean bathroom. The ceilings about 20ft high and had an incredible painting on it. The room was quite eerie, and dimly lit. My nine year old son was stood looking out on the balcony, when he turned around and shouted, what did you do that for? Me and his dad were at the other side of the room. When we asked what he was talking about he was convinced that 'Dad' had ruffled his hair with his hand and then ran away. Anyway, I just had a funny feeling about the place, and so we left to stay elsewhere the next morning! (call me a scaredy cat!) But any ghost hunters out there might be interested?!!

<Content>A hidden gem within the heart of Barcelona! I must admit, I was a little apprehensive with moving from the executive floor at the Hilton Barcelona to Hostal Rey Don Jaime I. My friend had used Hilton Honors points to stay at the Hilton, but had decided that we wanted to stay closer to the heart of Barcelona, so we went searching for hotels in the Las Ramblas area. To our dismay, most hotels in the area were soldout for the two nights we needed. Long story short, we booked 2 nights at Rey don Jaime for $65 per night, with the understanding of no air conditioning, but a clean bathroom. The entrance to the hotel was very narrow and hot, needless to say, I wasn't excited. However, upon our arrival the next day, they upgraded us to a room with air conditioning and escorted us across the street to our room. The room was very small, but very clean, and the bathrooms were recently renovated. It doesn't have any amenties like a TV, hairdryer, clock, iron, etc, however, the bed was comfortable. It was within walking distance of all of the action in Barcelona, and very close to the Cathedral. If you're planning on doing more sightseeing and socializing, rather than sleeping, and if you're looking for a clean, safe place to sleep in the heart of the city, I'd highly recommend it!

<Content>Clean, spacious and great location We stayed at this hotel in May 02. For us it was a little gem of a hotel. All we were looking for was somewhere clean to lay our heads. Very basic - no tv, hairdryer ect and you wouldn't want to spend the day there but our room was spotless and very spacious. It's located a short hop and a skip away from the centre of the Ramblas, Pla莽a Reial and not much further to the Barri Gotic in the opposite direction. If you've got a spare weekend and want to see everything Barcelona has to offer by day and night, it's a great place to use as a base to crash.
