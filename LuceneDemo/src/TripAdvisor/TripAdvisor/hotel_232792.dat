<Content>big room and convenient location Pros:The rooms are big compare to all the hotels I've been staying in Spain. Full bath with shower, walkable area with table and closet space. Rooms are very clean and beds are comfortable.The location is good, just around the corner(1 block) from Placa Molina station. The only disadvantage of this station is it is not a Metro line but a FCG station. So, the transfer to Aeroport/airport Renfe train can be a little tricky. The easier way is to walk to Fontana Metro Station(about 10 min walk) and transfer at Passeig de Gracia, then to Aeroport(train leaves every 30 min). Take about ~1 hour. The T-10(10 trips for 7.20 euro) pass works on Metro, FCG and Renfe and should only cost 1 trip.The lady on the front desk is very nice and knowledgeable. Skip the guys receptionists. They are what I call clueless and not helpful.Overall a good place to stay.Cons:The air conditional in my room is very sensitive to temperature. It will blow for 5 min and stop and blow again. Can be annoying and noisy.

<Content>Great value for money This hotel was recommended by a business partner who lives in Barcelona. The staff was very friendly and gave us the opportunity to fresh up when we turned up too early for check-in (08.00 am). The rooms are spacious and the bed was large for Spanish standards. Everything was kept very clean. The bathroom had all facilities and was comfortable. The hotel is located in a less touristic area of Barcelona and has a more authentic feel compared to e.g. the Ramblas area. Right next door to the hotel is a excellent backery with fresh sandwichs and great coffee. There are many restaurants within 5-10 min. walking distance. The Fontana sub-way station takes you in a couple of minutes to the Pla莽a de Catalunya, the start of many touristic ventures.

<Content>convenient and nice hotel the hotel is well situated, just 30 seconds walk around the corner of the metro station. there are bakery/cafe and a small supermarket nearby. we arrived late that night, but still managed to get a budget and light meal in the cafe near the hotel. room is clean and tidy.i was a bit disappointed about the bed in my room. i booked a triple room, and the third bed looked really 'extra', not having proper bed sheet on it and it's not comfortable, too soft, however, my bed was comfortable as it's a 'permanent' one.the hairdryer in the bathroom, it's the one with the tube like thing sitting on the wall. you have to hold the tube in a certain angle to get it swtiched on, however, it's loose, so i had to hold the tube for my friend, or else it stops every 5 seconds.but overall, it's a nice hotel ...

<Content>Very satisfied - lovely, good value hotel Me and my two friends booked a student holiday in Barcelona, and decided to splash out on a cheap hotel as it was only a few pounds more a night than a youth hostel. We were very impressed with the Hotel. Lobby was smart and clean with free internet and a range of international newspapers daily. There was a free coffee, tea and hot chocolate machine too - making up for the fact that there were no such facilities in the room.The room was luxurious compared to what we thought we would get for the price we were paying. The triple room was spacious, marble floors, and satellite TV, and the bathroom was very nice and even with a Bidet. We opted out of breakfast, so no idea about that! There were several nice cafes nearby anyway.Staff were very friendly and very knowledgeable concerning our travelling queries. location was excellent: literally ten minutes from Placa Catalunya by way of the metro (only 70 cents a journey, thus avoiding all the noise of the city when sleeping!)All in all a perfect hotel for the budget stay away. By far the cheapest hotel i could find after hours of research, and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Would happily stay there again!

<Content>good, not great This hotel was in a good location - quiet but with close metro access and a bakery and fruit stand nearby. We opted out of breakfast, but on their website coffee was advertised as being available 24 hours a day. In actuality, it can only be accessed after NOON, and it comes from a vending machine! The staff was very helpful. The room is very basic, but the bathroom is nice, with marble and bidet. There is free internet access in the lobby. Good overall value.

<Content>Basic but convenient I have just returned from a fabulous weekend in Barecelona but have somewhat mixed feelings about our accommodation. We chose the hotel as it was quite central, just 3 stops from Plaza Catalunya and was just over 100鈧?per night as opposed to the 250鈧?a lot of places were charging. The hotel was nicer from the outside than the inside and the staff's atttitude was that they quite clearly could not be bothered to deal with you or talk to you. We had to stand there for ages to be checked in while the girl on reception studiously got on with some paperwork! This seemed to be a general attitude with the staff which really let the place down. The rooms were fine, very musty and our view was of another (ugly) building. There were also some odd things - the room service menu offered only food from a well-known pizza chain which you would order through reception and there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms. A notice said you could ask for free tea at reception - I did and was looked at like i was mad, given a plastic gold coin and sent to vending machine. Horrible. Also they offer a very basic breakfast for the rip off price of 12鈧?per person but you have a range of lovely cafes right by the hotel which i would recommend. It was just about a 3 star, well located and if you can't find anything else affordable then its worth staying at, just hope they have employed staff more suited to the job by then.

<Content>Not a Bad Hotel Wasn't sure what to expect from this hotel as I couldn't find any reviews on it. However, I wasn't disappointed with the hotel once we managed to get into the city. Barcelona isn't know for providing useful information on its transport systems and boy did we get frustrated! It's dead easy once you know how but the train from the airport was a bit of an ordeal.The hotel is located round the corner from Placa Molina, although Sant Gervasi is just across the road. Both are on the FGC lines from Placa Catalunya. Fontana metro station is only about 5 minutes walk.The room had everything we needed, although the lighting wasn't that great for applying make-up etc but I managed. There was a good selection for breakfast: different breads, cereals, pastries, fruit, yoghurts, water, juice, Fanta, Coke, tea, coffee etc. The only complaint I would have is that the hot food was only ever luke warm, except when I asked for more scrambled egg because there was none left....we got a piping hot serving then.We had the misfortune of staying at the same time as a large group of Irish blokes who were rather noisy. They arrived at 2am...very drunk and made the same amount of noise at the same time every night. I think we were just unfortunate to experience this as the hotel isn't among the main tourist areas so probably wouldn't normally attract this type of visitor. I would happily stay at the hotel again.
