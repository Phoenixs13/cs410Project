<Content>Gross, Gross, and more gross I booked this for the stay and park (one night stay and park your vehicle while you fly somewhere on vacation) We were flying to Hawaii for a week. First thing, this hotel is so hard to get to and then when we walked in the lobby we were hit with this horrible stench. She said their sewer had backed up, but that the rooms didn't smell bad. They did, but not as bad as the lobby. She told us where to park our car the next morning and we were off to eat. Had a terrible time getting someplace to eat and finding our way back to the hotel. Then slept in a tiny room. Skip the free breakfast. The scrambled eggs were actually slimy. Then we got chewed out by Oliver (the manager, strange guy) because we parked in the wrong place. I guess the clerk the night before didn't know what she was talking about. The shuttle service is a joke. When we got back to Dallas no one was there and I called three times and an hour and a half later finally some weird shuttle arrived. I will never ever stay there again.

<Content>Vouchers from American Airlines-Terrible place for tired travelers After a long American Airlines flight from Indianapolis to Dallas (emergency landing in Little Rock, followed by 4 hours on the ground and finally taking off and again having to land in Shrevesport La for about another one hour delay) we of course missed our connection in Dallas and waited in line for 45 minutes to get our hotel voucher for a hotelat about 11:00 pm We got the Days Inn. The hotel was in terrible shape. The corridors were dirty and cluttered , the elevator smelled so bad that it made me sick, so we used the dirty unmaintained stairs instead. The carpet in the room was dirty, bathtub was dirty, etc. etc.. Worst place I have ever stayed and I have stayed in a lot of 3rd world countries. Do not stay here and shame on American AIrlines for giving customers vouchers to stay at such dumps.

<Content>A bit run down We aren't that picky, but this Days Inn is a bit run down. We were just looking for a place to stay before a morning flight from DFW. Even so, it leaves a lot to be desired. There was mold in the shower, and the bathroom sink drain was clogged and very slow to drain. The mattress was saggy. The TV stations went out (the channels just said searching for satellite signal). We did like that it had an in-room fridge and the shower was a massage-type showerhead. The outdoor corridors were noisy with people going by. Overall, this property is a bit run down but is adequate for a quick stay - if you get a good price.

<Content>Stay away! Not worth a free breakfast!!! We stayed at this hotel for one night on an overnight layover. We were just looking for somewhere close, clean and quiet with a shuttle and breakfast. We called on arrival and were told to wait downstairs for the shuttle driver. Well, DFW has multiple levels of parking and roadways, but after a while we found the poorly lit location. We waited about 45 minutes and were finally picked up and taken to the hotel. The kid working the desk was nice enough, but not very knowledgeable. We checked in, were given two vouchers for breakfast and then, as we were leaving, he said, by the way, YOU CAN'T USE THE WATER, IT'S CONTAMINATED!!! Apparently, this section of the city had some sort of low water table problem recently. We were told it was ok to use it if we boiled it twice. Well how were we supposed to do that in a hotel room? We headed off to our room only to find that we were given two doubles instead of a Queen bed. So we call the desk and the kid tells us we have to bring the keys back and then he'll give us another room. so, we do and were given a room on the THIRD floor. Why? This place was far from full. The room was small, cramped and musty and, the decor was dated The tv only received a few channels. Disgusted, I got out the laptop to take advantage of the advertised free wireless internet. What a joke! the signal was so weak it barely registered. I called the desk and he told me it would be fixed tomorrow. I never was able to sign on. Apparently, it had been out of service for some time and they just keep lying to people. (I found this out after I called the internet tech support) It's clear they don't spend much to maintain this hotel and they don't care about the customer. The best part of our stay was when we left in the morning. oh, and the breakfast.......my partner said it was ok, but I couldn't eat for worrying about the water quality. I felt we should have been offered a room in a sister hotel or some other kind of compensation, but none was offered. We will never stay here or any other days inn again!!!

<Content>Hooker haven My wife booked this for us to stay at while watching the drag races in Ennis. It is probably not somewhere we would stay again. It is in a little suburb of Dallas that isn't real nice. We witnessed on 2 occasions our first day there 2 hookers walking up and down the street in front fo the hotel. The second night we were walking into our room and witnessed a hooker coming out of another room and pulling down her skimpy dress. THe next morning we actually had a hooker knock on our door at about 9:30 in the morning. She was was trying to look sexy until my wife answered the door. She then realized she had the wrong room number to go to. The AC didn't work too well and the lock on the door didn't work right so management had to give us a master key to get into our room. There isn't anywhere decent to eat within close proximity. So, if you like hookers, this is the place for you.

<Content>Disappointed traveler I based my decision on Hot Wire star rating. They gave this hotel a 2.5 star rating. It felt like a budget hotel, something I would expect from a one star. I was given a smoking room eventhough I requested non smoking. I needed two beds but only got one. The TV only picked up about seven stations and the rest would not come in clearly. Front desk stated that they were working on it. I was very disappointed with the room. Although clean, smoking smell was very strong. Staff did not seem to be to concerned about my problems. I observed three other travelers complaining, so I guess I was not alone. This is a basic no frills low budget motel with not much ammenities. If that is what you want, that is what you will get. I called Hot Wire to see what I could do. They assured me that the competitors gave the hotel the same rating or higher. I have lost confidence in the rating system and will be very hesistant to booked with them again. I would prefer to pay more and base on my own selection. I guess I just expected more from a 2.5 star hotel.

<Content>Good Enough for a night or two as a "crash" pad. I spent one night at the hotel on the 16th, I was not pleased with the initial contact with the property. I am not familar with the DFW airport, I had called earlier in the day before my flight to Dallas to confirm that the shuttle would pick me up; the woman said to call when you landed and they would be there in 20 minutes. When I got off the plane I called, I was asked what terminal I was at (D) and then told to go to door LLD49 or something like that, in the courtesy shuttle zone. Anyway the woman yelled this at me, acted like I was troubling her for the call and when I called again because I had been waiting almost an hour she snapped at me again when I asked her if I was in the right place. Anyway after the surly driver, also the shuttle is not operated by the hotel it is operated by a company called RC Express, the shuttle starts at 4.40 A.M. or something and goes every 40-50 minutes. The property has had a few upgrades, the beds are very very comfortable, that was a very nice surprise. There was a fridge and microwave, well stocked bathroom. The hotel is not near anything reasonable to walk to and I don't think their restaurant is operational, so if you are arriving late make sure you have eaten something becase your options will be limited to the vending machine. I can't say anything about the breakfast, it wasn't being served at the time I left. This place is just fine if you need a hot shower, cool air conditioning and a soft bed at a resonable price. The hotel is fairly quiet as well.

<Content>pick a different airport hotel, not this one! This Days Inn is well-located near the DFW airport, but it needs new management...at least SOME management! The shuttle comes infrequently and at odd times, despite front desk assurances that it'll be just 5 minutes...waiting 2 hours at the airport curb is no fun. The front desk often does not answer the phone...the reason was obvious on arrival (finally) at the hotel; the front desk personnel were busy chatting and simply ignore the phone much of the time! Then, the wake up call came an hour early; breakfast was poor and put out 45min after the time it was supposed to be out (leaving 5 minutes for us to eat before getting back to the airport!). Pillows on the bed were cheap and hard. The building is decent, but staff need training and supervision, and the beds need to be replaced. Pick a different airport hotel, not this one!
