<Content>Nice hotel Just returned from a nice short break in Berlin. Two mature couples - booked with Ryanair/Expedia and got a very good deal.The hotel room was extremely clean and comfortable. The beds were comfortable too - we asked for extra pillows which we got.The staff were very friendly and helpful. The saftey deposit box is free. You can hire an umberella no charge just a deposit. You do need to get transport for the sights but it is very cheap. We got a BVD ticket at the airport - 24.50 euros each - this was for three days and took us on all the trains, buses, trams and ferries. The transport system is excellent - never a wait and almost always a seat.Must mention a fantastic resturant Stella di Mare. We went there on another person review. It is a lovely place with an extensive menu. Good quality food at very reasonable prices. I am a fussy veggie and I was not disappointed. Kostas the waiter is very friendly. We told him we would be back the next night and he had reserved a table for us.

<Content>good location My mother and I stayed here for 4 nights, we found it very central for the underground which we used to get around the city it was very easy to use. We also used the hop on hop off bus to see the sights which has earphones in 6 different languages to tell you all about the sights you are passing, this was located 5 minute walk from the hotel.There is plenty of shops and various places to eat close at hand, the food here is really good and I must give the restaurant Stella di Mare a special mention and to Kostas the man that looked after us on our visits there, was extremely good and very friendly and went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our dinner. When you go out of the hotel turn left, down to the next crossroads turn right and its on the left, 2 minute walk.The hotel from the outside does not look very good, but once inside , the bedrooms are very spacious and clean the bathroom is lovely and also clean, it has a balcony, a mini bar, tv but no kettle for your tea(we missed this) and no aircon which was really hot at night we had the balcony door open but was quite noisy. Breakfast was served up to 12.00 it had a good enough range of continental breakfast and had eggs scrambled and boiled along with bacon which was plenty to keep you going , we found it was very busy between 8.00 and 9.00. It was a very enjoyable stay.When we arrived at Shoenfeld airport we took the train to Kurfensdam station which took about the hour and cost 2.80 euros with one change at zoo. We took a taxi on our way back and it cost about 35 euros and it only took about 30 minutes.

<Content>Recommended We stayed at the Mark Apart for 5 nights at the end of July 2008. The hotel is well situated and easy to find. It is very clean and has polite and attentive staff.The breakfast, which was included, was a positive and set you up well for the day ahead.We had a street facing room and with temperatures averaging 35C, we had to have the windows open because of a lack of air conditioning - I am sure that in normal weather conditions that this would not have been a problem but there was a fair amount of street noise penetration. Advice - ask to be located at the rear of the hotel! That aside - we award full marks and the hotel proved excellent value for money.Clive, Angela and Stuart - Halesowen, England.

<Content>Basic, but clean Spent 2 nights here with family (2 small children). The room is basic, but clean, as is the bathroom. Small bar fridge. No aircon.Photo's of the hotel bear no relation to reality: it does look like a 70's architect make-over.Breakfast was adequate and served from 06h00 to 12h00.Located a short walk to Ku'dam.Probably wouldn't stay here again because- noisy apartment across the road- area is a bit run down

<Content>Good price/value/location Travelling by car to Russia, my wife an me were staying in this hotel for a short stopover combined with a short sightseeing trip through the city. Nice coincidence: It was the night of the Eurocup soccer final and the city center was in action.The location is very good as it is only a few footsteps away from the Kurf眉rstendamm, the former city-center of West-Berlin. Here you find all kinds of public transportation facilities (metro, buses). The new Berlin central railway station is however on a considerable distance (approx. 3 km).The breakfast buffet was standard, but ok. There was all we needed.Car parking lot is safely situated in the inner yard of the hotel. The hotel room was clean and large and the equipment was standard.The reception staff was friendly and supplied us with all the requested information.We booked online and got the room for only 65 Euro (weekend-tariff).If your aim is sightseeing in Berlin at a lower budget, we can highly recommend this place.

<Content>A really great place to stay. My mum, sister and I stayed here for 3 nights 10-13 Jan, '08 and were very pleased. Our room was huge. We gave the double room to my mum (who was celebrating her 65th Birthday) and my sister and I shared the twin area which was larger than the normal hotel room. The bathroom was also big. What pleased by sister also was the balcony. It meant she did not have to travel down and stand outside the hotel every night to have her last ciggarette before bed! The central location meant we were walking distance from everywhere. Kurfustendam was just around the corner. We even walked home from the Berlin Wall following the hotel map. I nearly forgot to mention the real plus for me. Breakfast was served until 12pm. Unheard of!! It meant we did not have to set our alarms which was nice. Staff, food, cleanliness all excellent.

<Content>Good value, no frills hotel My husband and I just stayed in one of the family rooms for two nights with three children, 8, 11, and 14. On the plus side, we had plenty of space and the linens seemed fresh and clean. Little bags of chocolate all over the room were a delight for the kids. The bathroom was clean and there were plenty of towels. The buffet breakfast had something for everyone. The price for two nights was only 209 euro (about $160), which is really cheap for central Berlin. On the downside, the hotel needs renovating. The carpeting is dingy and old and the room was kind of depressing overall. When I went to use the plastic soap dispenser in the shower, it fell off the wall. The liquid soap is of poor quality (bring your own), and when we ran out of Kleenex, we were only given a few more the next day! It was a bit noisy at night, but I always bring earplugs! If you aren't fussy and you're on a budget, the hotel is adequate and centrally located.

<Content>Fantastic value for money We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in December. I was expecting more of a hostel than a hotel but this place is great. The rooms are very large and very clean. The hotel is quiet and situated on a lovely street in Berlin. There are some other simlar hotels very nearby too. The staff were VERY friendly and helpful. The breakfast in the morning was delicious. There was a wide choice of both hot and cold food and everything was fresh. I would recommend this hotel to anybody and at the price we paid for it, I would have no hesitation staying here again.

<Content>Great location and exceptionally high standard! We booked this hotel via Lastminute.com and chose the hotel because of excellent reviews on this site. The hotel doesn't look up to much from the outside (a bit 80's peach colour!) but the location is excellent and the quality of service, cleanliness, standard of room, size of room and quality of breakfast was excellent. For a 3 star hotel as a base for exploring Berlin, you couldn't beat this hotel. 2 minutes walk from the bus stop on the Ku'damm which brings you straight from Tegel, which is also next to the Uhlandstrasse U-Bahn. Plenty of shopping, bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk. Quiet area, very accessible. Popular with businessmen, which makes it quiet in the evening and less of a creche at breakfast!

<Content>Nice hotel in good location The hotel is in a good location near the shopping district. The double room was large, clean, and has comfortable beds. As a previous reviewer stated there is no A\C but it wasn't an issue in October. The breakfast buffet was the best I had on the whole trip and the one girl maintaining it was always busy bringing more of anything that was low. The U1 subway stop Uhlandstrasse is about a 5 minute walk. There are two grocery stores and numerous restaurants nearby.

<Content>great hotel geat city the hotel is is nothing to look at on the outside but inside you have very friendly staff Big rooms plenty of storage space and a balcony in most if not all cases breakfast is plentiful with sausage ,bacon and egg included, but it seems very busy up until 10am  it seemed just one girl was trying to cater for everyone so that would be my only small gripe about the hotel  we arrived at shoneifeld airport got the S9 train to savingyplatz which is one stop after the zoo it takes one hour and costs 2.10 euro to walk to the hotel is about ten minutes get your ticket at the machine which covers zones A B and validate it on the platform enjoy

<Content>excellent value for the location If you've been travelling for a while and squeezing into compact rooms, this hotel is a welcome change. The rooms are pleasant and very large, but not air-conditioned, so with days at 30+degrees, we were lucky to be away from the west side of the building, so the heat wasn't too much of a problem and the room seemed to cool down well at night. The bathroom was of a high standard. Breakfast could get a bit frantic (as in crowded) but service was very good.The location is fantastic, and we particularly liked wandering into the leafy residential area south of Lietzenburger Str where there are some very nice restaurants. Lots of transport options were within easy walking distance and Tegel airport was a short taxi ride away.

<Content>Quiet Comfortable and centrally located I stayed at the Mark Apart Hotel during half term with my son. The room was enormous with a sofa as well as two comfortable beds. There was also a nice large bathroom. Everything was very clean. We were on a non smoking room on 5th floor. The hotel was very quiet even though we were on quite busy main road. The double glazing was very sound proofing. We had a lovely breakfast each day in their breakfast room. You were spoilt for choice with all the food. I highly recommend this hotel and will return again when I next visit Berlin. The staff was really friendly and helpful too. Full marks!

<Content>Great Location. First impressions of this hotel when arriving were not great, however we were pleasantly surprised and all of our party (14 adults) gave this hotel the thumbs up! Although it had no bar, its location was excellent and there were plenty of drinking and meeting places close by. The breakfast staff were good, reception helpful and the rooms were clean. In all the hotel was very good value for money and breakfast was included.

<Content>Even better than I expected I read the reviews prior to booking a room for the week May 6- May 16 from a bookings website. I was fairly confident I would be pleased, but everything exceeded my expectations. First, the location is very convenient to the Underground, and the Zoo Garden train station is within walking distance. I saw many of the hotels that get highly rated on TA in the area, so it is very nice area.The room size was enormous to me compared to other European or German hotel rooms. There was a couch, desk, nightstands with drawers on bothe sides of the bed, and an extra desk chair. The closet was an armoire with 2 sides for hanging clothes, and the middle portion had shelves. The bathroom was bright, clean, and had a nice shelf to put tolietries on. However, bring your own toiletries as the only thing provided is liquid soap and shower caps. A hairdryer was also in the room, and a magifying mirror.The breakfast buffet had a wide variety of items including various rolls and breads, pastries, cereals, granola, scrambled eggs, bacon, soft boiled eggs, sausage, yogurts, fruits, apple and orange juice, coffee and water. It was wonderful.Got a great internet special as I prepaid with my CC--if you see a good deal here, I would jump on it

<Content>Good value hotel I chose this hotel as it was one of the few that offered inclusive breakfast. Slightly annoyingly, the already competitive prices were even lower if we had booked at the last minute. We arrived rather late in the evening and were welcomed like old friends. All staff encountered were friendly and helpful.From the outside, the hotel is not the most attractive, but it really doesn't matter. The room pictured on this site was almost identical to ours - huge, comfortable and well-furnished. The bathroom was also spotless and modern. Rooms at the front are somewhat affected by traffic noise, more in the morning than evening, but otherwise the hotel is quiet.The excellent breakfast is served between 6.00 and 12.00 and is replenished, so there is always a good choice, including cooked items. Ask if you want tea rather than coffee.The area is near the Ku'Damm and it's best to use the Uhlandstra脽e underground, though if you want an direct journey from Sch枚nefeld without changing trains, take the S9 to Savignyplatz, which is a longer walk. Make sure you leave at the Savignyplatz side of the station.The restaurant /bar next door served us food at almost midnight and we didn't feel rushed.When we left the hotel, we were able to leave bags and there is a guest-toilet with space to get organised before departure if your flight is later in the day.The only downside to this hotel is the overt porn that appears before the pay TV sign, so if you're channel-hopping, it's there. This is a shame, because there's nothing else slightly seedy about the hotel or the area, but families need to be aware of this before the TV is used!Overall, this is an ideal tourist hotel in an area that feels safe.

<Content>A diamond in the rough My wife and I stayed at the MA for a week in early October. It is in a good location - a block off the Ku鈥檇amm, near a 109 airport bus stop, a U bahn station and the Zoo S bahn station. My first impression of the hotel was not favorable. Although the surrounding area is OK, the entrance to the MA is overgrown with weeds with a closed restaurant next door. However, inside it is clean and well cared for. Rooms are very large with clean, modern furniture. The rooms at the rear overlook a couple of courtyards and are very quiet. The large windows make them feel airy. The breakfast room is a little small but the quality and variety of the food is very good. The breakfast room staff was friendly and efficient. The front desk personnel were helpful.Overall, this hotel was a good value for the cost and I would stay there again

<Content>Excellent value for money at the Mark Apart Hotel I stayed here three nights and found the hotel to be excellent. It is clean, very well situated off Ku'damm and superb value for money. The breakfast is an all-you-can-eat buffet and is included in the room price. The only downside was that the room doesn't contain a safe but safety deposit boxes are available free of charge at reception and without any hesitation. Reception is open 24 hours. All TV channels are German with the exception of CNN, with the usual array of pay to view sports and movie channels available. A large bottle of water, a bottle of beer and two soft drinks are also provided free of charge.Wouldn't hesitate to stay again. The breakfast room had business travellers, familes with young children and adult groups so I guess it's suitable for everyone.

<Content>we made a good choice The Mark Apart was in an excellent location.Lovely bedroom-large light and airy.Wonderful comfy beds-wish I could have brought one home with me! Excellent breakfast-lots of choice.Friendly staff,all of whom could speak some English. No bar in hotel but excellent one right next door. Only a few minutes from the main shopping area.Recommend the Maredo restaurant for mouth-watering steaks and brilliant service. Couldn't fault our stay. Would definitely return.

<Content>I didn't believe wrong bookings occurred in Germany! Booked this hotel thru' expedia. On arrival, street seemed a bit run-down. Were flabbergasted when told by the receptionist that they had erroneously booked us at their main hotel, the Berlin Mark Hotel on Meinecke strasse. Had to trundle luggage for 300 metres to our new accommodation, which hotel turned out to be good and inexpensive. But for that hotel see reviews under that name.

<Content>Friendly staff lift the hotel above the ordinary I stayed at the Mark ApartHotel for four nights during February 2004, and the first thing you will notice is that the streetscape is not quite as attractive as it seems in the website photos. Although a few empty shopfronts, some kind of adult premises, and a few assorted low rent businesses surround the hotel, you are still only minutes away from the glamour of the Kurfurstendamm. The front desk staff were great, and most spoke fluent English. If not for the friendliness of the staff, the hotel could appear quite cold and impersonal. The hall lighting is almost non-existent at night (there are some buttons to activate it), which isnt overly welcoming, and the room furnishings themselves are rather bland. The room was huge however, and had its own balcony. The bathroom with combined shower/bath was modern and of a good size, however I found it next to impossible to have a shower without ending up with huge amounts of water on the floor (water pressure and temperature were great though!). The complimentary breakfast had quite a nice selection of hot and cold items, and I was surprised to find out on checking out that the objects I had consumed from the mini-bar were also complimentary. There seemed to be good deals on this hotel at most of the online resellers. Unless I was looking to stay in another area of Berlin, I would return here.

<Content>What a friendly, reasonably priced hotel! We stayed here in January 2003 on our first trip to Berlin. The staff at the hotel were brilliant, very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Rooms were quite ordinary but spacious and very clean with an excellent bathroom. Breakfast was nothing special but adequate and served by very friendly staff. This hotel is a good reasonably priced choice very near to the main shopping street, buses and underground. It is a little away from the main sights as these were mostly around the Reichstadt but we didn't mind walking and the buses were very punctual when our legs got tired. Hotel sells bus tickets and has a very useful street map of Berlin - staff very willing to help and advise.
