<Content>Looks Lovely, but Beware the Bait and Switch Overall experience was not the worst I've had - but pretty close. Be sure to get EVERYTHING in writing, so you receive all you expected and paid for - even if that means being insistent with the staff (who are brusque at best and downright rude at worst). Location is great; excellent neighborhood near fashionable shops, restaurants, and transportation. Non-smoking rooms really were non-smoking, which was perfect (and unexpected in Europe). Now the catches we experienced...We are seasoned travelers. We reserved two months in advance directly with hotel via email for our two-person, nine-night stay. Requested and were confirmed with a particular number Superior room, quiet, non-smoking, with in-room w-lan. After a 12-hour travel day, we arrived to check-in and were inexplicably assigned to a lesser room with a small bed. When we informed the staff of their mistake and explained we could not both sleep in the small bed (although we are both average sized), we were told there was nothing else available, despite the written confirmation we presented to the very person who corresponded with us. When absolutely pressed (she herself did not offer a single option or apology), she reluctantly said we could switch to the promised Superior room after the first two nights. With a large convention in town, we had no choice. These non-German speakers were simply too exhausted to argue. Incredibly, the staff tried to force us to pay the Superior room price for these first two nights and only relented after we disputed with our credit card. When we finally were able to move to a Superior room, the staff tried to shoehorn us into one without a shower (tried to sell us on the beautiful jacuzzi tub which is not all that appealing to these business travelers, especially given it is about the size of a thimble). We were willing to believe that this bait and switch was simply the result of a one-time misommunication with us, until we saw the very same thing happen to at least three other parties at check-in over the course of our nine-day stay. Coincidence? I think not.Finally, after two nights and two moves, we were allowed to take the actual room that we actually reserved. First morning, shower drain was VERY slow. Second morning, it was clogged completely; we could not shower without water overflowing onto floor (no tub - just shower). We reported to staff that shower was totally unusable and plumber (or at least Drain-O?) was needed. Staff never attended to this, despite repeated requests, and never acknowledged the issue unless I raised it. Finally, in desperation, I myself disassembled the drain and cleaned out a four-inch hairball (not ours). No, my friends, this definitely was NOT my most positive hotel experience. Shower worked just fine after that! Other issues: We were careful to request a quiet room and were confirmed with same; but neither the initial smaller room (facing courtyard) nor the promised Superior room (facing Fasenanstrasse) was quiet by any stretch of the imagination. Hotel touted the new fourth floor featuring in-room w-lan, but in-room w-lan was non-existent in either room; not sure whether the other few rooms on new fourth floor really do have it, as advertised. Hotel site claims that all rooms have...Internet (which I suppose is intended to mean a landline?) but neither of our rooms had any kind of land-line Internet access. Hotel site also claims there is a large breakfast buffet, but we found a hot chocolate machine and a table of meat that was picked over by 9am. Site also says there is a small safe in every room, but our lesser room did not have one.We found no in-room temperature controls, other than small bathroom heater. Very warm in room, even in May.

<Content>Very mixed blessinbg Not a good recommendation. It is well situated just off the Kurfurstendamm. The staff are pleasant. The room was pretty. Bathroom lovely but what they do not tell you is that they also accept parties of schoolchildren who take every available table for breakfast. With just one hot drink machine available, if you are unlucky you have to queue for your coffee, perhaps behind ten children. The reception is on the first floor and although there is a lift at street level, there may be masses of kids using it so you have to walk up. And the lift only stops between floors so you have to carry your luggage up some stairs anyway. They say there is as a safe in every room. None in ours. Phone not working either. They also pretended that they had no idea that parties of children were booked in - that it was an agency's doing. Hard to believe especially when the second group in four days arrived.

<Content>take care take care about rooms because they have different type : our room was very noisy and old style furnished compared to the closer one.We spent the first night without heating system and they didn't accept to reduce the entire balance from the original quotation. The concierge has been really unpleasant with us and they don't accept the american express even if we have booked with the amex code.Avoid the hotel because at the same price you will easily find a best location at the same price.

<Content>very nice I give this hotel an average rating because it is not upscale, but it is clean, pretty, well-run and cared-for. I completely disagree with the elderly couple who didn't like it. I stayed there in the summer of 2004 and found the staff very helpful, my tiny little room was all that i needed, clean and sweet. fruestuck (breakfast) was lovely. i love the german breakfasts! If you want to stay in west berlin, this is a lovely place. i just felt i had to defend it.

<Content>Lousy Hotel We have recently stayed at this hotel and found the whole experience horrible, and certainly the worst value for money we have had for many years.The staff were unfriendly to the point of being ignorant. They were also extremely unhelpful. We are senior citizens and had to find our own way to our room, carrying our luggage first up a flight of stairs from reception to a lift which went down to a courtyard. We had to go up three floors, leave the lift, go down a flight of stairs and along a corridor to our room.The room was facing the courtyard which afforded no privacy at all when using the bathroom. We were also asked not to put toilet paper down the toilet, which we found to be a disgusting request. At night there were generators continually buzzing in the courtyard making sleep difficult.Perhaps the worst experience was that staff entered our room when we were out during the evening and left the door open, fortunately nothing was stolen.Breakfast was from 7am to 10am. If you are down in the breakfast room later than 8am most of the buffet was gone, and was not replenished.The hotel does not have a bar.All in all, I cannot advise that you stay in this hotel. There are many better value hotles in Berlin.

<Content>Great Location I walked to the hotel from the Zoo train station and found the hotel just off a main street (Kurfurstendamm) with lots of restaurants in the area. There is also a U-bahn station just around the corner.The room was small, of course, but clean and quiet as it faced into the back courtyard. The staff were friendly and helpfull, and all I spoke to understood English.Although an excellent value, the Augusta might not be ideal for everyone. There are stairs to the reception on the first floor. Also my single room only had a shower. I prefer that myself, but bath-lovers may not.

<Content>Sehr gut! I very much enjoyed my may 19-22 stay at the Hotel Augusta, a charming small hotel in a superb location right off the Ku'Damm in exciting Berlin.The hotel is on Fasanenstrasse, a relatively quiet, fashionable street less than a half block from the commercial carnival that is the Kurfurstendamm. The hotel has a small charming lobby a flight of stairs up from its entrance. The rooms are cozy, well-decorated, bright and very comfortable. Bathrooms are compact but more than adequate, with glassed in showers. The beds were very comfortable, and the courtyard rooms - which we had - were very quiet.The breakfast room was bright and cheerful, with a very good breakfast buffet that included plenty of croissants, danishes, fruit, cold cuts, eggs, cheeses, good coffee, tea and juices.The location is great - right off the Ku'Damm and a half-block from the Uhlandstrasse U-bahn station. If you're taking bus 109 from Tegel Airport, just get off at Uhlandstrasse and walk around the corner. The Kaiser Wilhelm Church, Zoo Bahnhof train station, the KaDeWe department store and the broken chains statue are a very short walk away. Berlin's other great attractions can be quickly accessed by the excellent public transportation network.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location The previous review refers to another Hotel Augusta. This one is a charming gem of a hotel. It is completely renovated featuring small but charming and comfortable rooms. I asked for a quiet room and was given one on the Hof, or courtyard, which is filled with plants and trees. The hotel staff were excellent and extremely helpful. Breakfast is served in two sumptuous rooms, one with a balcony overlooking Fasanenstrasse. The location is perfect for Berlin West, right on the Kudamm. I got a great room rate from Berlin Tourismus-Marketing when the hotel I had been staying out turned out to have construction on all sides. I look forward to being able to stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Best place to stay in Augusta We recently stayed at the Augusta Towers Hotel and Convention Center (formerly the Sheraton) and were very pleased. The lobby is impressive, the staff is friendly and helpful, and room was comfortable and spacious. We would stay there again. There are many wonderful places to eat in the neighborhood, so I would recommend exploring rather than eating in the hotel.
