<Content>Fine hotel for the Budget Traveller My preferred hotel in DF. Located one block from the Cathedral, just behind the Monte de Piedad. The building is late 18th century, but the rooms are modern and spotless.A single, at time of writing, costs USD $26 per night for one or two sharing a bed. Corner rooms with two balconies are a bit more, at $30. Most rooms have balconies overlooking the street with big french doors. The beds are clean comfortable. The bathrooms are very clean with ample hot water (you may have to wait a few minutes). The rooms all have TVs, (with cable) and phones.Next door is the venerable Cafe Popular, with 24 hour service. A breakfast with eggs scrambled with bacon, a plate of fresh fruit, a bun or two and yummy traditional Mexican cafe con leche cost USD $4.50.The hotel, as I mentioned, is one block from the Zocalo, and from Mexico City's phenomenal subway system (fare USD $0.20!!!) which will take you practically everywhere in town.The lobby is very simple, but the staff is very friendly (they remembered me from my last visit 18 months ago!) Downside: It can be noisy during the day (the horn is the Mexican brake pedal) but, mercifully, the traffic dies down around bed time, so as long as you re not one to sleep late, you'll be OK (or bring earplugs.).I warmly recommend this hotel!
