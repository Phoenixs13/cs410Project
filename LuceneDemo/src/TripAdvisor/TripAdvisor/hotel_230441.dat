<Content>Pleasant Berlin Hotel After reviewing a number of hotels in Berlin on-line we chose the Best Western Euro-Hotel and booked directly with a call to Best Western. The price was a bargain and suprisingly included breakfast. Check-in was easy and the desk staff was pleasant with good English skills. The room was typical for Germany, fairly small , but well furnished and very clean. The only problem we encountered was the radiator in the room didn't heat as well as expected. The one in the bath was fine. The full buffet breakfast was very good and had a great deal of variety. The hotel is located in the former Eastern area of Berlin and there were a nuimber of Turkish stores around the hotel. We chose restaurants from a sheet provided by the desk clerk which we could walk to and were not disappointed. A major Karstad store was very close and the U bahn stop was just out side the door along with a taxi stand.

<Content>Excellent budget hotel We booked this hotel and the flights through Easyjet's website, and considering the price we paid we were more than happy.As stated previously it's not in the centre of Berlin, but transport links (bus/ U bahn) can whisk you there in 10 minutes or so. We bought group saver tickets from reception at just over 15 euros, which cover travel for up to 5 people on either bus, tram or U bahn for a 24 hour period - excellent value.The hotel was very clean throughout, with recently updated rooms that include TV, kettle and minibar.The breakfast was excellent with a buffet selection of fresh foods and juices, all of which will set you up for the day.If we go back to Berlin I would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Excellent service/excellent hotel The service and cleanliness of this hotel couldn't have been better. The staff were superb and very helpful. The breakfast room on the top floor was an added treat-a huge assortment of various food which was constantly refilled and you can view the surrounding area (windows all around) as you drink your coffee. The metro is just across the street and very easy to use. We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it We stayed in this hotel for two nights in September 2007 and found it spotlessly clean, quite luxurious for the price, fairly modern and very comfortable indeed. We only had brief dealings with the receptionist but she was friendly and helpful. It was easy to travel to this hotel from Schonefeld airport thanks to the 171 bus which cost 鈧?.10 each and ran straight from the airport to virtually outside the door of the hotel, although it is a long ride and takes about an hour. Buy your bus ticket from the machine outside the airport doors (and from the Hermannplatz station on the way back) and validate it by getting it punched in the machine on board the bus.This hotel is also ideally situated for the U-Bahn underground system, with Hermannplatz station right outside providing easy access to the whole city, with trains every few minutes.The breakfast was great with high quality food and drink, although we did catch the staff clearing away the buffet 10 minutes before it was supposed to end, which I think is unacceptable as there were still people walking in for breakfast, including us.There are plenty of kebab/pizza/noodle take-aways (and a McDonalds) right outside the hotel which offer food at twice the quality and half the price of equivalent places in Britain, and stay open till late. If you're happy to get by on take-away food in your hotel room, you can exist by spending next to nothing.There is a small shop a few doors away from the hotel, open until 2.00am and selling wine, beer, confectionery etc very cheaply - 500ml bottles of strong German lager straight from the fridge for 鈧?.55 each!Overall this hotel is a good base if you want to explore Berlin for a couple of days, and I doubt you could find anything better for the price.

<Content>Clean and convenient hotel We stayed at this hotel on a package tour and were very pleased with the rooms and breakfast.Our corner room was located on a lower floor - right on a busy intersection - and it was simply not possible to leave the windows open at night - too noisy. The hotel is in the process of installing air conditioning - much needed!Beds were comfortable - though German pillows are an acquired taste for a North American! Large clean bathroom with ample towels and hair dryer. Built-in soap dispensers were a plus as we were travelling light.TV worked well with two English stations - CNN and BBC News. Fridge was nice too. The Karstadt across the street has an excellent food floor so we could buy food and store in the fridge for lunches. Room included wine glasses and Karstadt also has excellent wine/beer selection.Access to centre of city by bus or Ubahn - convenient and quite fast.

<Content>Good Budget Hotel Can't fault the hotel in terms of cleanliness, friendliness of staff or the breakfast buffet each morning. The hotel was slightly outside of the city centre but with regular buses  U-bahn getting around couldn't have been easier.My only disappointment was that we received no prior notification that the hotel was in the middle of having air conditioning fitted. This meant certain floors were out of use and the lifts didn't go to these floors, including the breakfast room on the 6th floor. The air conditioning unit fitted in our room did not work at all. Our room was very hot at all times and the window was rarely opened due to street noise.Hopefully once they have finished installing the air con other guests won't face this issue!

<Content>Interesting location, hot room I stayed here myself in June 2007 on a two day trip to Berlin.Hotel was clean, price was reasonable, location near Turkish area of Berlin interesting, with excellent shwarma near by, some of the best I ever tasted, at great prices. Although it is close to the subway (across the street), it is quite a distance by subway from the centre of the western part of the city (the Ku'Damm) although not too far from the Alexanderplatz in the eastern part. The hotel is not located in a touristy area. Staff was efficient, if not overly friendly.My one complaint is that I could not figure out the air conditioning in the room, and the room was hot, stuffy and smelly for lack of ventilation. Iam not sure that the hotel had air conditioning or internal ventilation at all. Then again, I could have asked for assistance, but did not. My room was a single and quite small.Decent breakfast served as part of the price, although when in Europe I prefer a quick espresso on the street rather than a sit down breakfast. A good place to stay on a budget. Not much in terms of facilities such as a gym, pool, etc, but the hotel does advertise that it is affiliated with a health club near by.Good neighborhood bar a few doors down, lots of locals hang out. Friendly clientele. Drink of preference definitely mixed drinks or beer, not white wine.

<Content>Another good review! I can't really understand how people can moan about this hotel!It is on a direct bus oute from Schonfeld,which is ideal when you arrive late at night.Bus 171 will get you to the hotel in about 45mins to an hour,all for 2.10 Euro's each!The Hotel is based in a predominantly Turkish area,and has very easy access to Hermanplatz U bahn.There are ecent eating places nearby(especially if you like Pizza,you can get decent ones for 3 euros!!!) there is even a subway and Mac Donalds if you are abit sad!!!The Hotel room was big BUT it faces a busy road which can have noise implications.If you have kids you may want a back room.When we were there it was HOT! There is no AC but we got fan and there's a mini bar with a good fridge.A shop nearby allows you to buy your own drinks and use the fridge!!!Breakfast was buffet style and was more than adequate and comprised of the usual Euro delights of breads,cheeses,meats,fruit,cereals,coffee and a nice touch of Earl Grey tea!!!Overall this may be a problem if you have kids and are facing the busy road,although the double glazing drowns out the noise,if its hot at night you wouldn't want the windows open and a fan might keep you awake.The location is ideal for travelling around and it is relativelt inexpensive.The staff were always friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great hotel, no complaints We found the Best Western Berlin a great hotel. Staff were freindly and spoke very good English and were more than helpful with any questions we had while we were staying there.The tube station into town is less than a minutes walk and only take 10 mins to get to any of the main attractions.Room was a good size, comfy bed and nice and clean. Only problem we had was that the shower in the bathroom was broken and kept hitting you in the head.Breakfast was really good, nice and fresh and plenty to be had. Hotel also provides car parking in a close parking lot that was nice and secure.Would recommend this to anyone going to Berlin.

<Content>Just OK Adequate I have just returned from a four night stay at the Best Western Euro Hotel, Berlin.Rooms are spotless and cleaned daily. Good facilities - TV, Pay TV, Minibar, FridgeHowever, there is no air conditioning and the noise from the street below is unbearable. (Had to request a room to the back of the hotel having endured our first night with no sleep!!)Staff were obliging and spoke perfect English.The area of Berlin in which the Hotel is situated is not that attractive but as the Public Transport System is fantastic (on a par with the London Underground), it was fine.We felt safe at all times in the city.Berlin was a lovely city - a shopper's paradise with some lovely bars and restaurants - we were spoiled for choice.I definately would go back to Berlin but I wouldn't stay at the Best Western Euro Hotel

<Content>Loved the Best Western Euro Staff were very helpful, emailing me twice before my arrival, flawless English spoken, really friendly, very nice buffet breakfast on the top floor. They also went beyond the call of duty and posted some documents I had left behind when I called them from the airport, simply charging my card to cover postage, these arrived within a week! Also got a good view of Berlin from my 5th floor room. Price reasonable, very near the U-Bahn and only a short journey from two of Berlin's airports (Tegel and Schonefeld, I used the latter, also in SE Berlin). Loved it!

<Content>The Bear Necessities of life! The location is very good if you plan on using the public transportation: there is a bus stop right at the hotel door, that leads to the main shopping area (Ku'dam and KaDeWe), a very convenient Underground connection right across the street (U-7 and U-8 to Hermannplatz) and great transportation to all airports (to Schonefeld take line 171).The hotel itself is very un assuming, rooms are very basic without any luxuries, but the rate was very good, the breakfast buffet was rich and very good (3 different cheeses, about 6 different kind of cold meat, scrambled eggs and so on), and the hotel staff very pleasant and knowledgable.All in all, it is a very good choice for those who travel on a budget and for those looking for a place to crush at night.Amit.

<Content>Euro Hotel is comfortable  I liked this hotel. It was comfortable, pleasant, convenient, and seemed to be meticululously well-run. I was travelling alone, and was given a single room of a reasonable size for one - not just a converted cupboard. The bed was comfortable and the shower/toilet was clean  attractive.I chose the hotel mainly because of its location : in Hermannplatz right at the terminus of the airport bus (No. 171) from Schonefeld Airport. That's very convenient - esp. when you arrive at around midnight, and are a bit wary of being ripped-off by taxis taking you across a huge  strange city. The city U-Bahn is literally just around the corner, and it took me straight to Alexanderplatz in c. 12 minutes. The bus stop (for other buses places in town e.g. Charlottenburg) is at the hotel front door. People in Berlin asked me: Why are you staying all the way down there? That's not where tourists go. But I always said the location suited me fine. I never needed a taxi once: I always knew where I was going.The quality of the hotel was a pleasant surprise: the cold breakfast buffet was large, varied and very saitsfying - although the only hot dish was scrambled eggs ( but that's minor).It was lovely to eat breakfast on the top storey while looking out over the panorama of Berlin.I took my own electric kettle, coffee  milk powder with me, as the hotel didn't supply these for evening coffee in the bedroom.But they had complimentary coffee on offer in the foyer: you helped yourself as you wanted. I was even allowed free coffee after I had checked out and was waiting for the airport bus. Little things can mean a lot. I asked for 2 pillows instead of one, and got them. I was asked to pay a 50 Euro deposit for the mini-bar when I arrived. I said I wouldn't, because I had no intention of using it (I suspected having been ripped-off in other hotels) and I asked for it to be emptied straightaway. At midnight, the young receptionist didn't think he was allowed to do that: but the following evening when I returned, the minibar was empty and stayed empty all week. I liked that - getting what you ask for.I enjoyed my stay: the staff were pleasant  very helpful.

<Content>Central and Clean The hotel was in a Central Location at Hermannplatz. The train station is literally 1 minute walk away across the road. You are in the city centre in a matter of minutes. There is also a shopping centre next door for well priced food and gift shopping of all sorts.The breakfast on offer is a hot buffet style. Food was great no complaints at all. Our stay totalled 5 nights and would definitely go back.The area can be noisy and is not flash looking. Although our sleep was not disturbed and we felt safe at all times.

<Content>Cracking location and good safe area We have just come back from our trip in Berlin and I would advise anyone to stop at this hotel! 30 min bus ride from the airport (number 171 bus) and has a tube station across the road to get into the centre in 5 mins (number U8 tube)Good safe streets and the local night life is good as well. Vist Mickey's Bar for a cheap fun night!10 out of 10 for loaction and clean practical hotel rooms!

<Content>Decent hotel, so-so location We arrived late in the evening into Berlin which may have been part of the cause of my frustration in finding this hotel by car. Parking was also not too great as there is no place to unload the car and we had to trek the bags from the mall across the way back to the hotel. As we have found with other hotels in Germany, the front desk staff was not as helpful as we are used to.The rooms were not too bad, it is a little noisy but having lived in NYC for many years it didn't bother us too much. This hotel wasn't in the best area at night, but did have good access to public transport. Were were in downtown Berlin within a few minutes using the convenient subway. The buffet was good, we enjoyed it both mornings and the food was both tasty and plentiful. The mall across the street had an excellent little grocery store, we were able to purchase our lunch supplies there. One note about Berlin in general, figure out the subways before you go down into the system. It isn't too bad if you take a minute beforehand. Also, the Famous Walking Tour of Berlin is excellent.

<Content>Excellent location, good value We enjoyed our stay at this hotel due to the pleasant and friendly service from staff, the hotel's location which is across the road from the underground and the Airport bus which stopped outside the hotel from both main airports. Our room was clean and spacious with room service everyday. Breakfast is a buffet which is quiet varied, although we did notice that staff did not replenished food so consequently guests who arrived later found that there was little choice. The hotel provided excellent information on tours and attractions and were very helpful in general. Overall, our opinion of this hotel is excellent and would recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel that is good value and comfortable.

<Content>Just back from the Euro The hotel is average, as is the breakfast. It is across the street from an underground station, which is great. Also, a large department store is acorss the street, which is a nice feature. Rooms are maintained. However, the hotel has no air conditioning system, and we had to have the window open all night for circulation. The hotel sits on a very busy corner, and all night the sirens wailed, buses stopped for passengers directly under our window, and the traffic in general was very nosiy. If it had been another season, perhaps the noise would not have been an issue. The area of town is not the best, either. The staff was helpful, and that is much appreciated. We left from Tegel Airport, and you take one U train, then a bus, and you're there in about 45 minutes. Easy as pie.

<Content>Great location for Schoenefeld Just returned from four days in Berlin, staying at the Best Western Euro. My friends and I had one triple room (with one double  one single bed) and one single room between us. Both rooms were very clean (cleaned and towels changed every day) and the beds were very comfortable. We were on the sixth floor which helped reduce traffic noise, as the hotel's at a corner next to a crossroads with traffic lights. There's a phone, a minibar, TV and internet access. The restaurant on the top floor served an excellent breakfast every morning - it's a self service buffet with a large selection of breads, meat, cheese, eggs, yoghurts and drinks.The best thing about the hotel was the location. If you're coming from Schoenefeld you can get the 171 Airport bus to Hermannplatz (the last stop) for 2 Euros. It takes about an hour but it's also a regular bus service. There are a lot of people getting on and off - not the best if you have large suitcases. You could take the U-Bahn from Rudow station instead - It's about five mins from the airport in a taxi but there is also a station outside the airport. The hotel is right next to the Hermannplatz U-Bahn station. Buy a day ticket for 6 Euros (or a group ticket for up to five people for EUR15) and take advantage of Berlin's integrated subway system, you'll only have to wait 10 minutes at the most for a train. We had no problems getting around. The streets around the hotel are fine, we didn't feel unsafe at any time. There's a great Croatian restaurant about 2 minutes walk down the street and there's also a Lebanese one nearby. You're also close to a bakery, shops, bars and a McDonalds (if you really have to!).I would definately recommend the hotel. It was between this and the Abacus Tierpark when I was deciding but this hotel is better located for getting into the centre of Berlin.

<Content>Great value and convenience Stayed at the Euro hotel for 4 nights and found it a wonderful base in Berlin. The underground is literally right across the street from the hotel, and from there you can easily get to anywhere in the city. The connection to and from Tegel (TXL) airport is easy and inexpensive. One subway ride (no transferring) and a short bus ride to the airport (included in the trip price).The room size was adequate, and the mattresses were extremely comfortable. One note, the rooms are not air conditioned, and if you open the windows, the traffic noise can be a bit loud. If that is not an issue for you then I would give this hotel an excellent rating. If that bothers you, I would look somewhere else.The breakfast was good, and was served in a beautiful room overlooking the city on the top floor. It feels like true luxury. The neighborhood is nice--not touristy, and feels comfortable to come back to each evening. There are some nice neighborhood restaurants around the area. It feels like the Berlin people live in, not the Berlin that only tourists visit.

<Content>Comfortable, Clean and Affordable!!! The hotel is small, but comfortable, clean and quiet. The staff is helpful and they speak English. There is a computer with internet connection in the lobby. The hotel is well located. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. We arrived at the Schonefeld airport and took the bus #171. It costs 2 euros and it takes about an hour to get to Hermannplatz, which is the last stop. The hotel is right around the corner. We paid 75 euros per night (March 2005) and it included buffet breakfast with a variety of things to choose from. I specially liked the variety of fresh German breads with all kinds of seeds in them. The dinning room is on the top floor and has nice views of the city. The subway is right in front of the hotel. On the same block of the hotel you can find a department store, a Mc Donald鈥檚, dunking donuts, a pharmacy, a bar, a bakery and lots of other stores. We definitely recommend it!!

<Content>Stay here if looking for good value all round hotel We stayed here for 3 nights in November 2004, and I couldn't recommend it highly enough. The hotel is literally a stones throw from Hermanplatz U-Bahn station, and the Berlin U-Bahn/S-Bahn system is as good as the London Underground if not better. So even though it might look like the Hotel isn't in the centre of everything, don't worry because you can get anywhere you want on the trains. The Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, nightlife etc are all within easy reach, as is Shoenefeld Airport.The rooms are spaceous, clean and have everything you need, and if something isn't in the room chances are if you ring reception they will be able to help. The staff are all lovely and speak excellent English. Breakfast offers a massive choice and is served on the top floor.We paid 拢175 for the two of us for 3 nights which was really good value.I would definitely stay here again - it's not the Adlon, but for the money you pay you will be more than happy here.

<Content>Ideal location if flying in through Schonefeld airport This is a very nice small hotel, very clean and friendly. Good english spoken. Its ace feature is its location in the interesting suburb of Kreutzberg, on one corner of Hermanplatz where the 171 Schonefeld airport bus has its terminus so access from Schonefeld with luggage is logistically easy. From Hermanplatz there are two U-Bahn underground lines into the city centre - Alexanderplatz is only 10 minutes away. We paid 脗 79 per room (March 2004) including a fabulous breakfast on top floor (6th) breakfast room which has spectacular views. Great value for money!
