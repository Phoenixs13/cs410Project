<Content>Vile First impression, dirty, dull, depressing. Bathroom was like a cupboard and hairs on loo seat. Two sinks in bedroom made terrible noises all night. One bed on sitting on it. Felt generally unclean and kept socks on all the time so as not to make contact with floor. Although on top (4th) floor, could hear movement above us in the early hours. Definitely one place to avoid, although very central. I guess you get what you pay for.

<Content>Dreadful noise problem! Escaped from our 3 month old baby and a traditional, quiet hotel sounded just the thing. They put us in a room just beyond the bar, the corridor had 5 guest rooms - and the bar toilets! Not surprisingly noisy at night, also woken at all hours of the night with constant banging doors. Only hotel I've been in where I've been woken in the morning by a football being kicked against the door! Asked to change rooms but told it was impossible, more like inconvenient. Spend a little more and go somewhere better than this.

<Content>Great good value hotel - excellent service We stopped for three nights from 11th October - as a group of 5 couples.Arrived late but hotel easy to find - only 300mtrs from underground. Very easy to get to from Schoenfeld airport.Staff very welcoming , helpful and friendly - the bar would stay open as long as we wanted!The hotel is quaint with an old fashioned feel. Rooms clean, if a little shabby - bathrooms are good.Breakfast is OK - bit on the basic side.We found some excellent restaurants close by.All in - a very good base for an enjoyable time in Berlin - at a great price.

<Content>Good value hotel This was my third stay at the Savigny for six nights.Insofar as Berlin is so big this is reasonably situated, being 300 yards from the Ku'dam and convenient for Charlottenburg. It is also on the direct U7metro line from Schonefeld airport. The staff are friendly and English speaking, the rates are reasonable and include a buffet breakfast and good coffee.The rooms are as you would expect of a two star hotel-clean and adequate.The hotel has an indoor and outdoor bar. I will stay here on my next visit to Berlin.

<Content>Pretty good value, friendly staff This hotel is not very central, but it is very affordably priced. The staff were friendly, courteous and most spoke good English. They also helped us organise restaurant reservations in the city. The breakfast buffet (included in the price) was generous. We stayed for a 'stag weekend' and so got back quite late each night - even so, we were met with a friendly welcome and a refreshing glass of beer at the bar!

<Content>we left the hotel after one night we came to this hotel thinking it is in a central location. It isn't.taking a look at the pictures published by the hotel you get the feeling the rooms are very big. they aren't. The breakfast was great and the stuff are very friendly and helpfull.The hotel is very old but not looks good and also not so clean.

<Content>Good hotel for the budget minded Booked the hotel for two nights stay prior to departing from Tegal Airport. Overall rating was good quality. Excellent price based on the location (if memory serves we paid approx 60 Euro a night). Hotel was clean but older. Large room but small washroom. No airconditioning. Hotel is located on a busy street. Reception spoke english well. Breakfast was good. Close to many amenities and 15 euro to the airport. One point to note is that if you are trying to get there by bus you should ensure that you have a map as the street which the hotel is located on changes names.

<Content>For people who like being insulted Whilst staying at this otherwise unremarkable hotel, I came down to breakfast one morning and quietly proceeded to gather some food from the buffet, whereupon the chef suddenly appeared and began to reprimand me for using the 'wrong' size of plate for the sort of bread I wanted and the 'wrong' type of bowl for the sort of cereal I wanted. There were several sizes of both.This is local etiquette gone mad in an age of international hospitality. If Germany wants to enhance its reputation for customer service, it should not treat its 'guests' like they are characters in a Kafka novel who need to follow unwritten rules. I will not be staying here again.
