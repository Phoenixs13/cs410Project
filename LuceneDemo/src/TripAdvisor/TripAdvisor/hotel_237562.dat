<Content>Great Value and clean! Friendly clean cheap smoker friendly hotel. Don't stay there if your a yank wanting out of this world service (good luck finding 'service' full stop in Amsterdam!). But if you are looking for a cheap clean central location, this is your stop. I had a lovley window that opened onto the canal and madness below, best smoking spot in town! Perfect thanks!(not sure about the whole restraunt thing though, you'll see if you ever go...)

<Content>Has its good and bad points First impression was OMG!!!! JEEPERS CREEPERS!!!! and the smell - not cat like as previously mentioned - it just smells old and damp. Very noisy location with a bar/club underneath my room window. If you have any sort of mobility probs forget this place as its like living in a wonky ship - its all steep staircases and feels like its leaning over towards the canal. On the plus side - great location, decent staff, good breakfast and a fab shower.We enjoyed our time in Amsterdam and this hotel is perfectly situated for the Red Light areas. Surrounded by loads of places for food also. It's a 2 star hotel - but seriously its no where near that. It's a place to put your head. It is probs the next step up from a hostel. I initially could not believe this was where I was to be staying - but give the place a chance, its good for a few days, clean towels every day, secure reception, ensuite, tiny bedrooms (mine was a twin which was about 1.5m wide so if you want to swing someone its impossible. My advice - - for 2 to 3 days break on the cheap its perfect - - any more than that look elsewhere. Also forgot to mention, its very very dated decor (if you like Fresco you wont be dissed lol). Biggest compliment I could make (A COMFY BED AND PILLOW)

<Content>Great Location Descent Hotel. Great location! Right in the red light district. Breakfast was good. I liked how it was on until 10 am. Staff was friendly . Beds were comfortable. Only strange thing was that we came back to the hotel after a long day and found my underwear and my friends on the floor. That we were sure we did not leave there. A bit strange but other than that it was good!

<Content>Great for the price and location Stayed in a few hotels round amsterdam and this is one of the best. You get an en-suite which is very rare for this price. Rooms are small but if you have been to Amsterdam before you know they are all like that. There are added bonuses you don't get in some hotels like the stairs are not to bad which is a case in most hotels and the staff are friendly and if you need anything to drink it is very reasonable. They let you leave your bags there arfter you have checked out and the rooms are cleaned daily, the view over the canal is a bonus and it is not noisy concidering where it is. Enjoyed it so much l am going back there in a week!!!!

<Content>Would stay here again and again and again The Hotel Vijaya is only a 5 minute walk from Centraal station, Smack bang in the middle of The Red Light District and there are tons of Coffee Shops everywhere. The staff were helpful and gave me and my partner a map of the area. The Staff were layed back, I was able to smoke my weed in my hotel room. The room was a little small for a bouble but who cares? thats just a place to sleep after all! The bedding was clean and so were the towels provided, also there was a good supply of toilet paper and 1 soap bar and some shampoo in our hotel. I felt very safe here and cosy in the Vijaya. The breakfast was included in the price, fresh bread rolls, crossents, slices of meat and cheese, boiled eggs, jam, fresh orange juice, tea, coffee etc...it was like a breakfast buffet, you just help yourself.The hotel was open at all times, which is handy if your a party animal and stumble back at the Vijaya hotel at 5 in the morning.The stairs to our room were very steep and long it turned your legs to jelly, but I found this more funny than annoying.Just one down fall - they should of put a 'OUT OF ORDER' sign above the telephone as I wasted a few cents trying to call home.All in all I loved it here, and would definatly stay here again.PS. I read a few posts on here saying that there were smells of cat urine, bugs etc.... I found this not to be true.

<Content>great location Just returned from my stag weekend (4 days) and the vijaya was perfect for all our needs,great location ,clean and tidy  relatively cheap as well.This is not the hotel to take your missus for a nice romantic break,but is great for everything else,Always felt safe very secure which is good seeing as you are right in the middle of the red light district and only a 3 mins walk from central;

<Content>Cat house We stayed in this 'hotel' in a group of about 20. when we arrived there were cats running around everywere and the smell of cat urine was disgusting! on the bright side we were close to everything...we were not expecting much from the reveiews we had read before going but the hotel was actually worse than we expected! non the less we had a great time in amsterdam! This year we will be booking into the botel which is much better and cleaner!

<Content>Decent hotel, GREAT location I really liked this hotel. It is clean. Single. En suite. The only complaint is the free breakfast and for some, that may not be a big deal. It's the typical cold meat and cheese and bread and coffee. Nothing special. Not a deal breaker for me and in fact have chosen to stay here again this coming November. The breakfast at a nearby hotel was superior, but it was not en suite. It's hard to find a decent hotel room for one, but this one is IT!Staff is great. Friendly. Helpful. My favourite part? The church nearby whose bells that plays 'Land of Hope and Glory!'. The location is also great, depending on what you are looking for. It's one block off Warmeostraat, which is usually where I end my nights so it was a nice short walk (stumble) home for me. It's also on a nice quiet canal street. It's close to Centraal as well, which is always nice for arriving and leaving.

<Content>Don't go there !!!! Crouded hotel with small rooms, beds and the windows have a stupid mecanism and it's hard to close them perfectly down so when it rains you might get wet in the sleep because the bed is under the window. We came there in the afternoon and after we waited for about 30 min we get and payed our room and went to visit the city and in the evening when we came home the hotel manager asked for more money without givind us any explanations. we have the breakfast included but we wait for about 1 hour to get a cup of tea and a biscuit. In conclusion : don't go there

<Content>You Get What You Pay For This has been the second time I've stayed at this hotel in two years. Last time there were 5 of us in a big 5 man room, this time just 2 of us in a very narrow room, but still with a canal view over Oudezijds Voorburgwal (only 5 minutes walk from Centraal Station), which was great. The room was dark, but adequate and the bathroom was absolutely fine. The TV was fine too, plenty of channels to choose from, many Dutch, German and Swiss channels and a couple of English ones too (BBC World, BBC 1 and CNN). Not luxurious at all, but en suite, changes of bedding and towels every day and at 鈧?5 per night between two of us, we certainly were more than happy. No mice either, despite leaving crisps out !! The counter staff were slightly aloof but generally friendly and helpful if needed. Security is good too, we never felt unsafe in our room. Yes the location can be not to everyone's taste, but if you book a hotel in the middle of Amsterdam's famous Red Light District then you should really know what to expect. This year we noticed a heightened police presence and the feeling of safety around the Red Light District was better than it's been for a couple of years. For me and my friend the location can't be bettered, that's why we came back here after staying here last year.Also, the restaurant just a couple of streets away was excellent, really good food, an attentive waiter and 25% off the bill because we were guests of the hotel.So for stag parties or groups of mates who want a cheap place to get their heads down after a hard night's partying, you would go some way to beat this place. There's no way I'd stay here with someone special for a romantic time, it just isn't that type of place. But for a good old weekend away with the lads, I'd definitely come here again, can't recommend it more than that really. Overall, good value, great location.

<Content>Not that bad! This hotel aint the Hilton and it reflects that in the price you will pay! Its ideal for people just requiring a bed to sleep and basic breakfast! I stayed here with friends for 2 nights and had no problems whatsoever. The hotel is smack bang in the middle of the Red Light District!

<Author>inch1975
<Content>much better than I expected I nearly cried reading the reviews on tripadvisor, 'cos by that time I already booked hotel Vijaya for 5 nights. But... when you expect the worse and receive something decent, your impressions become positive. So are mine about Vijaya.If you book the cheapest hotel in the middle of Red Light District, don't think it will be some schick, luxurious and romantic place. It is not. It's a place for small companies, where you keep your things, wash and change clothes, spend nights and take quick naps. Don't come with kids or for romantic trip (err, depends on your girlfriend of course, but I'd never book anything in this district for myself if going on romance:))Location: 5-10 minutes to the Central Station, 5-7 minutes to the Dam square, 5 min. to Nieumarkt square. Pretty far from Vondelpark and Museumsplein.Sleep: you'll be able to fall asleep only after 3 a.m., as before that time nearly all crowd willing to see the ----- is crossing the bridge just under your window. From 3 a.m till maybe 10-11 a.m. your sleep will be rarely interrupted by the noise. The canal view from the window (we had a triple room on the 2nd floor) is spectacular. To sit in your own place watching the crowd but not being the part of it is really fun. And (that's important for smokers) - you can smoke in the room whatever your like. The rooms are more than simple, if you ever lived in a 2-star in India - looks like it (besides, Vijaya is owned or managed by people from India, so the likeness is obvious). The shower is a hole in the floor separated from the toilet by some plastic curtain, but even when 3 of us took shower in the morning, the water never flew over the level (as we once had in a two-star in Italy, where after taking a shower you had to swim in the bathroom to use the toilet:)) The towels are changed every day. Bedsheets - on request (in our case it was a note with the tip:)) The mouse: yes, there is a mouse. What do you expect from the 17th century building? It goes out only at night, first scared me to hell as I thought I was hallucinating:)) Regard it as a pet and don't leave food on the table - it will leave your room as soon as there's nothing it can consume. Security: one of the best you can imagine in such a district, though you can't say so from the first glance. To enter the place first you should use the doorbell, then a man at the reception asks your room number and surname and if you by any chance want to invite friends (in our case we needed to take in 6 people), you have to talk to the staff, explain why and how many people are coming and when they are going to leave. We kept our tickets and pretty much money in the safe at the reception (Don't know if there was a safe at all, but they returned the whole thing without troubles:). And everything was OK with our belongings in the room, they never even tried to take euro coins as tip, though we deliberately left it on the beds.Restaurant and breakfast: oops, never had a chance to try it as we were never up before 10:00. There's much places they serve English breakfast in the neighbourhood.So I think that's it. Absolutely OK for that money. Before booking this place, think of the purpose of your trip. For having fun with no pretence for luxury - Vijaya is good.

<Content>Did what I expected. At first i was very depressed and down when reading reviews about this hotel, however when i got there it catered for our stag party needs. The rooms where basic, however we only slept in them. (NO BUGS or RATS as ive read in previous threads.) We had 2 Rooms, a twin and a 5 bed room. on our 1st night the lock broke on our twin room, so the hotel upgraded us to the apartment suite on the top floor(couldn't do enough for us.) We didnt get breakfast in hotel(never up lol) however we did go for our free drink in the hotels restaurant.However if you have trouble getting up and down stairs down go as the stairs are rather steep. Also you could request a ground floor room. As regards to location, its like anywhere in amsterdam you could throw a stone and hit the head of someone trying to sell some illegal goods.Done what we wanted, can't complain

<Content>Hotel From Hell I stayed 3 nights at this hotel in march 2007. I had made a confirmed booking through Hotel.NTL.com, yet upon arrival was told I would have to pay 100 euros extra for my room because I had not confirmed the booking even though I had a confirmation number in my hand. They then used other excuses such as my credit card had bounced even though payment was to be by cash upon arrival. They also said they had informed me of this by e mail yet somehow the only e.mail received was my confirmation of booking. All in all this hotel is of dubious character. Avoid it totally.You have been warned.

<Content>ok except the mouse stayed here with friends for three nights in october this year. the room was basic with a view over crack head corner as my friend dubbed it. if you stay here it might be an idea to suspend any snacks you leave in the room from the ceiling as we had a visit from a hungry mouse who feasted on the big bag of potato snacks we had stored to ward off nightime munchies. the hotel cat clearly needed a good talking to! five out of ten.

<Content>Awful! This hotel is in a good location - especially if you want a taste of the red light district! I would not recommend coming here with a family. The room was dated, tiny and did not inspire confidence. Also, the stairs are not for the faint hearted! The breakfast was edible, however, compared with other hotels it was not great.  If you are on a budget, as we were, I would still stay clear of this place - you will definitely be disappointed. The only plus side was that the location was central. Also, do not expect to get much sleep if you stay here - the street noise is terrible!

<Content>Infested with parasitic animals I stayed in this hotel for a lad's weekend in Amsterdam. Location is good. Rooms are crummy and of very poor quality. They are noisy and very hot in the Summer months. Worst of all 3 out of the 4 of us that stayed in the room caught a parasitic animal from the beds which meant a costly and embarrassing treatment when we got home. Avoid like the plague (or you may catch it).

<Content>Cheap,Cheerful and central a very average hotel, but what can you expect for the price? Myself and my girlfriend got a very good deal, so i cant really complain about the averageness of it, as the rooms were clean, breakfast was decent and we were in a very central location.Bad points would have to come being the stairs, although, being to amsterdam before, most hotels there are the same, high and thin! We paid 160 euro's for a double room for 3 nights BB. overall i was happy and would go back if i wantded budget accomodation again.

<Content>worst hotel we have ever stayed in My husband and I have just returned tonight from Amsterdam. Thankfully we only went for one night! We were staying at hotel Vijaya and the only positive thing is it's excellent location. We arrived at the hotel before the check in time and was told to return in an hour. We then had to wait a further half an hour at reception before the room was ready. We were directed to Room 3 which is outside of the hotel around the back. This is where the wheelie bins and scaffolding resided. Old paint pots sat on the filthy window sills outside. There was no working extractor fan in the shower which meant the steam had nowhere to go, hence the room was damp. We thought the sheets were damp so asked for some more. All our clothes felt damp too. We had to ask for more towels as only two small towels were provided. Not even a simple hook in the shower room to hang the towel up! Breakfast very very basic. Bed side lights not working! Holes in the sheets. Need I go on.... Please don't stay here

<Content>Awesome This hotel was excellent. I have read all of the other reviews and most of them did not help. This is not really a hotel to go to with family or a partner for a sightseeing tour. It is 2 - star so you cant expect room service and a jacuzzi bath. This hotel has an incredible location for a group of girls/guys just inside the red light district, it is very noisy at night outside the front until around 3am, this was fine for us as it was so interesting to watch everyone go by. The room we stayed in was a triple, it was ample, clean, wood floors, 3 windows and seemed secure. The staff ask you to leave your keys at the desk which was great for us as sometimes we came back seperatley so there was no lost or forgotten keys. Its so close to many bars, restaurants, coffeeshops and many sex shows etc. The area may not be suited too much too children and old people but that doesnt mean that they wouldnt enjoy it. It is like 5mins from the station if that. It depends how much you expect from a 2 - Star hotel, with kind, helpful staff, clean rooms and corridors, breakfast (which was nice, very fresh), 24 hour reception and fans on request, we got a lot more than we were expecting.Excellent hotel, great price, vibrant and perfect location would go again over and over, it is Amsterdam in a nutshell.

<Content>Steer Clear not only was this hotel as crooked as hell, but it was smelly, dingy, out of condition and the staff were flat out RUDE! I have never been made to feel like such a child.the staff here are very untrusting, barely understand a word of english, and the 'authentic idian they so called offer, is not authentic at all...this hotel is miserable just like the staff, the only plus side was the location. Also, the staff made you leave your keys behind before you went out, this didn't exactly fill me with confidence that my belongings were safe.. basically...STEER CLEAR

<Content>Great budget hotel I stayed at the Vijaya hotel with my 13year old daughter and we had a great time.The indian restaurant 2 streets away which they own is very good,also the staff were very helpful.Of course it is not 5star but there is so much to do and most of it within walking distance of the hotel all you need is a room to sleep in.The hotel is manned 24hrs and security is good.

<Content>Hotel from Hell Do not stay here! If you can find nowhere else, sleep at the Railway station. It would be quieter. My mother and I had booked through venere months in advance but when we arrived after a full day travelling from Rothenburg in Germany the very rude desk staff told us we were had been quoted too low a price. They demanded full payment in advance and THEN took us to our broom cupboard. We had recently visited Dachau Concentration camp. The rooms were bigger and cleaner there than our room at the Vijaya. I could reach both side walls with arms apart. We had a lovely view of the canal and the noise of the pub/cafee below which began at midnight and went on until 4a.m. the first night and 2 a.m. the next. The breakfasts featured dried-up slices of bread, dried up slices of meat, a minimum number of greyish boiled eggs that quicly ran out and were not replenished. On the third day we wer moved to a larger room higher up but still noisy. The bathroom here stunk and was covered with mould. We gave up for the fourth night and moved to another hotel but we got no refund. By the way a message sent by friends was not passed on to us and they insisted on calling me by my first name. My advice to anyone is steer well clear of this dump.

<Content>Great location! A friend and I stayed in a double room overlooking the canal. I stayed for 4 nights. the room was cleaned regularly and the staff was very friendly and helpfull. the breakfeast that is included is a great bonus. It consisted of coffee/tea, breads, cold cuts, hard boiled eggs ect. there was quite a bit of street noise but this should be expected given its prime location right next to the rld. I felt very secure in the hotel. they have a contoled entrace with servailance. overall it is a great choice for those on a budget and interested in a central location to explore all amsterdam has to offer.

A few mins from the train station, and right next door to the red light district and the usual collection of pubs/cafes.Bad: A bit grimy, my mates got bitten by bugs! And if you get one of the rooms at the top of the stairs let me say that they're hard enough to walk (crawl) up when you're sober!Overall: It's not as if you're going to spend much time there, so if you can overlook the bad bits then you could do a lot worse.

<Content>a bit overpriced but nice location Stayed there with a friend for 5 nights in july. 5 minutes walking from Centraal Station. Good location if you like RLD, close to all coffee shops, sex shops  sex shows. A bit pricey considering it麓s a very simple, basic hotel: 95 euro/twin room/night. Room was number 3, at the back of hotel, so we had no problems with noise. Facilities: cable tv in room (a lot of channels, but 3 or 4 in english), bathroom with toilet  shower, clean towel  soap everyday except for 1 day... , good continental breakfast (tea, coffee, orange juice, eggs, ham, cheese, bread, butter, jam; from 7:30 to 10am), no lift. Staff friendly. No problems with junkies on the bridge... Ideal for single travellers or small groups of friends.

<Content>Cheap and Accommodating Slap bang in the middle of the red light district, a hotel cum indian resurant - But i wouldnt advise eating there!!! The rooms are basic and clean, and good for the price. If you have a hip problem this is not the hotel for you, like most places along the canal front the stairs are steep.But they do have a very good security pass on the door and there is always someone about

<Content>Handy spot Possibly a bit pricey considering the size of the group we were, but that mattered little. The hotel itself was nice. Possibly a bit shabby, but you wont be spending too much time in it anyway. It right in the Red Light which is handy as the best pubs/clubs etc seem to be around there. The showers were nice and hot, the rooms were big and airy (strong radiators as well).Id recommend this to groups of fellas, but somehow I doubt girls would feel as comfortable there.

<Content>good location in rld Stayed there in April, a nice cheap hotel in the RLD, the staff was nice,the room was cleaned every day and given clean towel and linen. the only negative was that it is a bit rundown and could use a coat of paint. A great place for young or single guys who want to be in the middle of all the action.

<Content>good hotel just came back from a week in amsterdam to check out some shows. had a great time, beautiful town, the hotel was right in thr red light district. i didn't realize this when i booked it, but figured i should stay with it. it was a very nice hotel, small rooms, as i learned that most around there are, except maybe for the bigger chain hotels. i was by myself, so i had a single, and the room was a little tight, but as long as i had a bed, and tv, i was fine. private shower, very clean, they gave me clean towel and soap every day. nice people working there, though sometimes they seem busy, and don't like being asked too many questions, but it's pretty much like that every where there. they were still patient, and gave me my envelope where i kept my passport and money in their safe any time, though they asked to do it before 10 at night. you have a key, so you can go in and out of the hotel anytime, but i wou;dn't recomend staying there alone, because the junkies can be very annoying. no serious probs, but still very annoying, so personally when i go there again, i would prob stay in another area, but for a cheaper stay, nice hotel, i would recommend this place.

<Content>Top Banana Five lads on a long weekend in Amsterdam found The Vijaya hotel to be just the place to stay. You might not take your ladies here but if all you want is a place to rest your head and take a -----, shave and shower then look no further. Staff were very helpful, stored our bags on the final day so we didn't have to carry them around for 8 hours, kept passports in the safe, good continental breakfast. The location is first-class, smack-bang in the middle of the Red Light District. We'll be back!

<Content>great location..great hotel. just back from a 3 night stay here, the staff were great, the location is brill...the room was very basic but very clean had a great view over the canal..breakfast was everything you could eat and plenty of it well worth the 95 euros for a double room, considering you are not in it very much...the hotel is right on the edge of the RLD so you are in the middle of everthing...have a great time we did.
