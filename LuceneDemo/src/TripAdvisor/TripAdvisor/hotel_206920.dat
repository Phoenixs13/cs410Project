<Content>Really nice hotel Really enjoyed this hotel it is well placed for amenities and a short walk to the metro etc. The bedroom was clean and spacious with a dressing area also. I shared a double room with two other people and there was plenty of space. The breakfast was varied with plenty of choice. The roof top pol was lovely and so was the sun lounges/ table and chairs. I never ate anything other then breakfast at the hotel though but it looked quite expensive. Overall highly recommend.

<Content>Handy for town Stayed here for 5 nights in January for a conference at the CCIB.The room was nice and I cant say that I really had any complaints apart from the air conditioning not working in my room (219), not such a problem in January.The town centre, Las Ramblas etc was around a 15 minute walk away and you can reach most of the underground metro lines within the same time.

<Content>Nice hotel in a decent location I stayed in the NH Podium a few weeks ago, and I am usually a very cautious person about hotels and prone to critique since I have worked in the hotel industry in 5* hotels for about 10 years and recently started working for a large multinational where I have to travel a lot. The location of the hotel is really good, about 10minutes walking to the El Corte Ingles department store, the Ramblas and a short metro ride from the exhibition areas of Montjuic and also Gran Via. It was about a 3 minute walk to the metro station, and Barcelona really has a nice metro network. You're never far from anything. Its not a luxury hotel, but a good upscale one with all the amenities. The room was quite big with a nice view of the front side and looking on pretty old buildings. They had a small but adequate gym and a roof toop pool area, although the water was quite cold in the pool. But the warm sun compensated for that. The breakfast was good and not too expensive, but I wished they had more different kinds of cheeses and more vegetarian options, but then again spain is big on meat. The staff was really nice and helpful, and did their best to help me out and delivered as promised. My only complaint is that the soundproofing is not that great, and you can hear your neighbours TV going on. But I hear from a friend of mine who used to stay in Barcelona quite a lot that the soundproofing is not that good all over Barcelona. So I would stay here again on business or if travelling alone, but my wife is a light sleeper so maybe not with her. Overall I recommend this hotel for business people and tourists alike as the price level was not too bad even if I was staying there during a large exhibition. Then again I booked quite early. But if you are one of those who wakes up with the slightest sound, choose some place else. Personally I liked it and would recommend it to my friends.

<Content>Modern hotel, great for business or tourists We stayed at this hotel at the expense of another NH hotel (Duc la Victoria) over booking. So we were lucky in the fact that our daily rate didn't change. This 4-star hotel is very sleek/modern, clean and comfortable. Not to mention its great shower and beds! The hotel is only a 10 min walk from Placa Catalunya and not even a 5 min walk to the closest metro (Uranquioa). We found taxis to be rather cheap so all in all location wasn't even an issue.There isn't much excitement going on around the hotel, i.e. restaurants or shopping, but it is well worth the stay for the luxury of the room (esp when luxury isn't a well-known commodity in Europe)I would recommend this hotel to anyone who can afford it!

<Content>Good hotel at a reasonable price The Hotel is in a very quiet location, close to Arc de Triomph metro station (2 minutes walking). It takes about 10 minutes (or 2 metro stops) to reach Plaza de Catalunya. The neighbourhood seemed safe: we were 2 girls and walked back to the hotel at 11 p.m. without any problem.The lobby is very stylish and the room bigger than average. The bathroom offered a wide range of amenities (comb, toothpaste and brush etc...) And candies on the reception counter are irrestible!The pool on the roof is also worth the visit.I made the reservation via (--) as the NH website showed no availability for the date I had chosen.

<Content>comfortable, basic quality Our room at the NH Podium was comfortable, modern and nicely appointed. It was rather small for the price but that may be because it was on the 5th floor, where the building narrows a bit. Location is great for sightseeing and still in a very quiet, safe neighborhood.

<Content>Visit Enhanced by Hotel My wife and I together with another couple had a 3 night break in Barcelona in April, staying in the N H Podium. We were very favourably impressed by the overall standard of the accomodation, the friendliness of the staff and especially the cleanliness of the rooms. The provision of toiletries each day in the spotless bathroom was fairly unusual for a 4 star hotel. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Good value comfortable hotel If you can find a good deal then this hotel represents excellent value. I went away for New Year's weekend with my girlfriend and we found it to be a very clean and pleasant environment.Our room was quite large with a pretty big bathroom. The service was pretty good and the staff were knowledgeable and helpful to help tourists get around the city. The breakfast is SUPERB and definitely the right way to start the day, with a huge selection of cooked and continental bits n bobs. Do make sure that you a) are sure it is included b) are prepared to pay 4* hotel prices for it before you dig in.The hotel is well located, very close to the Metro and within comfortable walking distance of the Gothic quarter, Las Ramblas and the Placa Catalunya, where you might want to wander to find some decent restaurants.

<Content>Nice quiet hotel. Not far, by foot, from all the attractions unless you are very unfit. Good service and staff and nice civilised breakfast above ground. Bedrooms corporate and comfortable.

<Content>Average October 04. Just spent 4 nights at this hotel. Hotel was ok and made a good base. It is reasonably central, so not far to reach the tourist spots, though not keen at night as it is in a quiet area with not much around for evening entertainment ie restaurants, bars etc. The room was small but was very clean and anything used was replenished, also my favourite... clean sheets every day. The reason I give it 3* is the food, we tried room service breakfast which was expensive but I don't mind if it's edible... this wasn't. Also one evening we were tired so we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant...big mistake, though it looks nice, we were the only people in there, which seemed odd, but then the food we had was very expensive for what it was and disappointing. The hotel bar was ok and I found the staff on reception helpful though one gave us the wrong information one evening so it was a costly cab ride that turned out to be a waste of time. Even though I have been a bit negative we my review we did enjoy our stay in Barcelona.

<Content>Beg to differ with the positive reviews I read the reviews before our trip to Barcelona and was quite looking forward to it.However, on arrival It was back to reality. Having been allocated a tiny room on the 5th (top) floor, we went down to reception to ask for a nicer room - were told in a condecending tone We are full, and have no more rooms. You will have to stay in this one. The bathroom was a similar size to the room, which had a 2 feet border around the bed, and not much more. Also, the marble corridor outside echoed everyones' footsteps, and the door and walls didn't keep out much noise .... We also had the benefit of partaking in the party in the room next door, from our room, where we could hear everything ! The police were finally called at 4am, and we got to sleep around 5am - not the best preparation for a meeting at 0930 ...When approached that morning about the incident, staff shrugged, and also advised us that there was a wedding in the hotel the following night, so that even if they could move us, it would be more noisy on other lower floors. So tough luck, in other words! Staff attitude was generally VERY poor in every encounter, whether just meeting them in the corridor, or at reception.Our room neighbours were actually quiet the following night, whether they were moved or had checked out, but there was still quite a lot of noise from the corridor, from people exiting the roof bar, etc.In any case, couldn't recommend the hotel for any reason other than it was close to our meeting location. We would have moved hotel, but the city was quite fully booked, and rates were very high for other locations. On our next trip we will stay at the Hilton and take a taxi !

<Content>Loved It This was my first trip to Barcelona and the NH Podium helped make it wonderful. We stayed there for 3 days. Our breakfast was included in the price and it was typical European with pastries, small sandwiches, cheeses, hams, yogurt, champagne, water, OJ, and milk. The staff was friendly and courteous. My Toyota 4Runner wouldn't fit in their garage, so they found a garage where it would fit. They provided with maps and pointed out all the sites that were close by and even recommended their city's best beaches. I would stay again the future as the hotel was wonderful and situated close to the Sagrada Familia, La Perdrera, and the Arc de Triomf.

<Content>Loved it My boyfriend and I stayed here last week for 3 night and it was great. The hotel is very modern and our room was very cool, it was like 3 different rooms, bedroom, study, and bathroom - it was on 2 levels. It's about 5-6 blocks from Plaza Catalyuna which is the center of town, so it's easily accessible to everything but not super easy to run back to get something mid day. Barcelona is such a huge city though that I don't know where would have been any more convienent (and safer) location. The staff was great. One warning however, if you are going to take the train to the airport, I would recommend going to the station at Catalyuna. There is one closer but it was difficult finding the right entrance and there is no ticket office there to ask someone for help.

<Content>Good but watch the breakfast! Hotel well located - easy walk to Arc Triomphe and direct metro line to airport there; about 15 min walk to Placa Catalunya where you get all the tour buses, etc, and Ramblas, Gothic quarter, shopping area of Gracia, etc. Hotel itself very nice and ok sized pool on roof terrace, plenty of lounge chairs. Decent gym and weights. But don't assume breakfast is included or that anything you are given is free, even if you aren't asked to sign a receipt, because there were some extra charges that surprised us when we checked out and the management were extremely rude and unaccomodating.

<Content>Great Location  Stayed at the Hotel Podium for 2 nights in July 03. Very centrally located easy walking distance from Place de Catalunia, but far enough to be quiet at night.Rooms and communal areas were very clean and bright.Good hotel for a short stay.

<Content>Worth every euro! The hotel isn't stunning in looks, but it's located near d'Arc the Triomf and central in Barcelona. The room we had was big enough for us. The sleeping erea wasn't to bad and the bathroom is big and clean. And the entire hotel was very clean. The staff speaks English and were there when we needed them. We didn't have diner in the restaurant but you don't want to miss breakfest in this hotel. It's just THE BEST! Fresh fruit and juices....fresh bread in every shape, form and taste. Scrambled eggs, bacon ( all made for you ) ....lot's of sweets ( cakes, cooky's donuts, pie )....my wife liked the fresh pineapple and strawberry's. It's just the perfect way of beginning your day of exploring the city. It's not a tourist hotel, but more for business and therefore not that crowded. We've enjoyed it very much!
