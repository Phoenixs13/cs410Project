<Content>Great place in Old San Juan This is a beautiful restored hotel in OSJ right on a square. It's architecture is fabulous and the tile work is awesome. It is close to everything and is right by a trolly stop if needed. The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. The continental breakfast is good and so is the coffee! They will also hold your bags after checkout if you want to explore some more before your flight or cruise.
