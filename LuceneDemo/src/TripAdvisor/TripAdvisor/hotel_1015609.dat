<Content>Very basic We booked a superior room for 4 nights.What makes the room superior is the fact that it has a window. though the window cannot be opened. If you are claustrophobic- this hotel is not for you...The room is very small but has all that you might need including an LCD television and a basic DVD player.Everything is very basic, so it's good for a short stay on a budget, nothing more.What's good about this hotel is that it is very close to the MRT station which is very important in Singapore, unless you want to take taxis everywhere.The location, otherwise, is not a touristic area, just a simple residence area.

<Content>Last night in Singapore My husband and I stayed for one night only at this Hotel. It was a budget hotel, but not budget price. The room was extremely small, but fairly clean, as it was advertised as nearly opened. The towels were wafer thin and very small, no bathmat and only enough hot water for one shower. The soap container in the shower was empty. The shower and toilet area was very small and the water from the shower covered the whole of the area. The fan in the bathroom could not be turned off, so it was on constantly and very noisy. The mattress had a vinyl covering with a very thin sheet over it, so sleeping was very uncomfortable, there was no padding on the mattress at all. The reception staff were not very friendly and gave no assistance at all. The breakfast which was included in the price was very simple, orange juice, two eggs with chicken slice, not hot, two slices of toast and tea or coffee. I would not recommend this hotel or stay there again.
