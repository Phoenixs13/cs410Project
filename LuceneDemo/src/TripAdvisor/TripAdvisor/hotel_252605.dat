<Content>Nice overall I spent a week in this hotel and although I expected the worst after reading several reviews, I was happily surprised. The hotel was clean, with a nice lobby and restaurant. My room was clean and I had two bottles of water every day. I had wifi connection, blower and iron. I had breakfast every day and dinner a couple of nights and food was fine. Eating breakfast was more expensive than dining. The clerks at the counter were somewhat distant, but they took care of my petitions. The hotel is near the Parque Hundido Metrobus stop, which is very convenient to travel North and South of Avenida Insurgentes. There are a lot of stores and restaurants nearby. To me, this hotel could be rated with 3 stars.

<Content>It's not that bad.... I stayed here for two nights to attend a seminar at UNAM. Since I was giving a presentation, the institute prepaid my room and made all the arrangements (so I can't comment on value, etc.)There were three people staffing reception when I arrived. It appears the reception desk also handled all telephone reservations and it did appear to be very busy with telephone calls. The person who checked me in was friendly and spoke a little English. Personally, I don't expect the rest of the world to speak English and with my two-dozen words of Spanish, I was able to communicate fine in my interactions with the staff. It does seem their room reservation system does have some problems as the receptionist checked me in to room 501. The bellhop picked up my bag and the key, saw the room number on the key and went back to the reception desk. There was a short conversation (I'm thinking something along the lines of I just took someone up to room 501, are you sure it's available?) and then the receptionist issued me a key for room 701. During this time, there was much viewing of a complex display that appeared to a map that showed the status of every room in the hotel.The room was good-sized with two double beds, LARGE closet, desk by the window. Bathroom was good-sized with plenty of hot water. Housekeeping provided 2 bottles of water that were replaced every day. From the 7th floor there was a great view looking out over the city with the mountains in the background (when the smog finally cleared up). The hotel fronts on a very busy street and drivers love to use their horns there, so there is street noise. 7th floor was high enough that the noise was pretty minor, but if you are a light sleeper, I'd suggest asking for a room facing the back of the hotel.Bellhop showed me how the air-conditioning worked. AC unit was not noisy but it did blow directly on the beds so I turned it on when I left the room for the day and then turned it off before going to bed. Yes, the blankets are fuzzy and the sheets were not 300-count, but the bedding was clean and comfortable. The bed was firm (not hard in my opinion...I've slept on some HARD beds in budget hotels). The marble step a previous reviewer mentioned was a 1/2 high ledge meant to keep the room from flooding in the event of a water problem. I also noticed a drain in the middle of the bathroom floor. It's not uncommon to see this in older hotels (in fact, when I travelled in eastern europe, it was standard to see these two things as the shower was typically not separate from the rest of the bathroom).The elevators are a little funky, but I've had worse elevator experiences. These elevators use a light beam/sensor to determine whether someone is entering/leaving the elevators. I noticed the bellhop using his hand to break the beam if the doors opened but no one broke the beam (ie, when the elevator arrived, and it was too full for the person to get on). An eccentricity that would cause people to think the elevator wasn't working.Breakfast in the restaurant was typical hotel, decent quality but overpriced for Mexico City. Service was OK, coffee at the table as soon as I sat down, waiter taking my order as soon as I closed the menu, food arriving fairly quickly. Once you get the waiters outside of their routine though, it was a problem. One morning, I started out sitting by myself and then had colleagues join me as breakfast went on. The last two people got coffee right away, but then after five minutes had to ask for a menu and then had to track down our waiter down to get their orders in to the kitchen. Overall, I would characterize this hotel as an older hotel (style strikes me as 1960's) that has been well maintained but not updated. Staff are typical: small problems here and there, but generally acceptable. I would definitely stay here again given my understanding that there are few hotels in this part of town. There are many restaurants in close walking distance and the MetroBus (running the length of Insurgentes) is a convenient and cheap way to get into town or to a subway station.

<Content>Not Horrible but not great either I stayed here in connection with a meeting so I didn't have much choice. It's pretty cheap but you get what you pay for. My room smelled funny and had a really loud AC unit. Also the room faced the main drag on the 4th floor and was really loud. I'd definitely advise if you stay here to try and get something that doesn't face Insurgentes if you can. As another reviewer mentioned there's a loud -- really loud restaurant across the street that stays open late. But, generally the hotel was pretty clean and again, fairly cheap. Still, I think you can find much better in Mexico City. Look a little harder!

<Content>Absolutely the worst Major dissapointment from the start. Got in late in the evening and was met by a staff that spoke zero english. In a big international city like Mexico City I would have expected better.Rooms looked passable enough so we settled in and ordered room service. It was awful...undercooked fish and shrimp so tough even my easy going husband got frustrated and gave up on it.When it was time for bed we discovered the passable room ended where the beds began. under the bright clean duvets were two blankets..one that looked like salvation army surplus (sort of a tangerine colored heavy cotton) that was stained and crusty. The one under that was one of those fabulous furry things you find at flea markets with the giant lions on them, only with no lion. The beds themselves were like stone. I have never slept on anything so hard in my life. I woke up after a miserable nights sleep feeling like an 80 year old woman.The bathroom, again, looks passable - but after you manage to not kill yourself on the huge marble step in the doorway just designed to rack your toes in the middle of the night you discover the shower has zero water pressure and the hot water, if it ever gets hot in your room, is moderate. On a side note, I forgot my shaving razor so I sent my husband to get one. Would you believe they made him pay for it? I can't think of the last hotel I've been in anywhere that didn't have free razors or toothbrushes for the occasional guest who forgot one.The hotel has two..yes TWO elevators for 9 floors. Each elevator is the size of a linen closet and at maximum can hold five people. Five people with no luggage. They are wickedly slow and once we even got stuck inside when the doors wouldn't open.On our second night there the hotel filled up with teams of what I assume are children's soccer players. Some kind of local tournament or something. Suddenly the doorbell on our door (yes, the doors have bells at this hotel) was being rung. Our room was getting crank call after crank call. Kids were playing ball in the halls, tying up the elevators by sending them to every floor and a number of other stupid childish things. Could we get the hotel to do anything about it? Heck no. They just shrugged their shoulders and spoke no english. I even got our hosts in mexico city to call them and they had no better luck. So, we spent another three nights there not sleeping.This hotel is ridiculous. It claims to shelter celebrities and important people..but quite frankly I can't imagine any celebrity anywhere putting up with such nonsense.Avoid this place. If you have no choice, don't eat there and take a big can of lysol.

<Content>Convenient Hotel with Poor Staff. We stayed at the Diplomatico from October 26 until Nov 6th. This Hotel is located near the Bullring La Mexico and the Soccer stadium. It is right across the street from Parque Undido. There are Plenty of restaurants within walking distance along Insurgentes Sur which is the main avenue in this area. It is about 25 mns away from the Airport when traffic is normal, otherwise it could take one hour during rush hour.The restaurant located on the second floor is not too good. Only to be used if you don't have time to go out. You can order domino's pizza for delivery.We arrived on Oct 25th with a reservation confirmation from the hotel garantied by credit card. We were told there was no room available because a group had decided to overstay. There was no manager on duty to speak to. We showed we were unhappy and argued firmly. We found out other guests were in the same situation as us. The Staff offered to relocate us at another hotel at the other end of town which was not acceptable to us. We eventually found, on our own, a room at the Fiesta Inn, not too far away but at a higher rate.The next day we returned to the Hotel early in the morning to speak with management. They made us feel stupid as if it were obvious they were right and we did not understand what had happened. We eventually were given the room we had reserved and after a long argument they accepted to pay half the excess price we had spent to stay at the Fiesta Inn. They should have paid for the entire difference and the cost of getting there and back and not argue about it. In fact they should have honored our reservation in the first place. We had a Suite with two queen beds. The Suite is very spacious and the bathroom is old looking but efficient with hair dryer. Standard double rooms are of a decent size with identical fixtures.Although everything in this hotel is old looking it remains in good shape. Rooms are decently sound proof. They work with their own cab and chauffeur. It cost us 1.000 pesos to have a chauffeur take us to Teotihuacan for the afternoon with a stop at the Basilica.The suite cost about 850 pesos per night with an early reservation on the hotel web site.Considering it is often difficult to get good service in Mexico hotels when something goes wrong, I would still recommend this hotel if you need to be in this area of town. Just be prepared to fight it out and defend yourself.Local restaurants worth trying and within walking distance are El Buen Bife, El Candelero, Konditori, and less formal across the street from the hotel are Papa Bill and Freedom. There is a department store close by called LIVERPOOL as well as convenient storesSandborns, 7Eleven.

<Content>Good, comfortable, friendly staff, but... I stayed for four nights. The room was very comfortable, the staff was very friendly (bellboys, room service, the restaurant in general...), it had cable TV, minibar; I always found it clean when I returned to the room. In general, I was very satisfied.BUT... Actually the only complain I have was the air conditioner, which seems to be broken because it did not cool the room to my like. The other recommendation is that you need to keep your valuables in the safe. I even kept my laptop in reception when I was not carrying it (the hotel recommends you to do so). I am saying this because my last night I was coming back to my room and in the corridor another customer told me that some of her things had been stolen, and asked me whether the same had happen to me. I had nothing of value, so nothing was taken. So I took my precautions, but you beware.

<Content>great room for a great price I spent one week at Hotel el Diplomatico during my first visit ( alone) to mexico city. The room was big and very comfortable, clean and had all the necessary amenities. The staff was very friendly, even though on the phone before arriving they told me they had availability, and once I arrived from the airport they didn't have rooms available. I had to look for another Hotel for that night, but came back the following day and had the room. This wasn't a good start, but I'm glad I went back because the location is excellent, the staff is nice and helpful. I was alone so this was a big issue to me. The only cmplaint I have is the maid service: at 4.00 pm often my room was not ready, and the maids were in the next room watching TV!! But overall, the price was so low that I didn't care. In the morning I want to the free gym. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Hotel Not Recommended... This hotel on the outside appearance seems really nice, and along with its decent price and close proximity to the World Trade Center does really well. But it does need to update it's decor inside, along with updating the rooms so that you don't hear the person in the next room sneezing or their intimate activities. The phone in the room had a lot of static making it very difficult for people to contact me in my room instead of on my cell phone. There was no voice mail system, so callers had to either call my cell phone for voicemail or trust the front desk to slip a note under my door. The television never worked, even after calling maintenance. And the controls for the air conditioner worked only after spending a half hour pressing the buttons really hard in order to get them to work. However, the hotel staff was more than outstanding. If anything, that is what made the stay bearable. But there is no bar, no gift ship, or mini bar. I do not recommend this hotel for business travel.

<Content>A waste of time and money Tried to stay a couple of nights at El Diplomatico, as it is close to the National University, but it turned out to be a waste of time and money! I called them to make a reservation, and they ensured me they had available rooms for the next day, and I could walk directly to the front desk. What a mistake I made trusting the info they gave me over the phone! When I arrived to the front desk coming directly from the bus terminal with all my luggage, they simply told me they had no rooms, and didn't even offer an apology for giving me misleading information the day before!!! No one seemed to care about the situation, nobody offered any help. I had to call Hotel Sevilla (where I regularly stay but it is a little far away from the University Campus) to make a last minute reservation, and pay a taxi from El Diplomatico to Hotel Sevilla... In 4 years visiting Mexico City regularly, this is the first time I got such a poor service from a Mexican hotel!!! Needless to say, I will never try El Diplomatico again.

<Content>Good central location This hotel is very well situated. We never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a bus or taxi, and were at our destination in good time. The rooms was comfortable and very well lit. The restaurant was not special, but there were great places nearby to breakfast.

<Content>Fine. Just fine. There is nothing major wrong with this hotel, there just isn't that much that stands out. It screams for a renovation (decour is old and faded, bathroom walls are yellowing, etc.), and I almost got stuck in the lift one day because the bellman encouraged a 5th person to get on (they are rated for four). Dispite the listing here, there is is no gift shop or mini-bars in the room. There are a few resturants across the street, and a bar a half a block away that is open until 3:00am. There is, however, a night club that seems to be about five meters from the back of the hotel. It is only open on Saturday, but it is loud then and open late. The staff is very nice, the area is good and the rooms are clean. I guess if my client had me stay there again, I wouldn't make a fuss -- however, if someone was asking for the name of a hotel in Mexico City, I would not rush with recommending the Hotel El Diplomatico.
