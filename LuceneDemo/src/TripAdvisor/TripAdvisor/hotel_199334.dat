<Content>Great Hotel, great location We stayed in the Miramar in December to visit the Christmas market and the location was perfect. We were very impressed with the welcome which included mulled wine and stollen cake.The hotel was spotlessly clean, the room was great and all the staff were friendly and helpful. The included breakfast was ample with lots of choice and really set you up for the day. We will definately be staying at the Hotel Miramar on our next visit to Frankfurt.

<Content>Nice location Overall I liked this hotel. The room was a bit small but expected. It was very clean. It has an elevator which is nice. The front desk were very nice and spoke excellent English. Parking was close by and very reasonable. The buffet breakfst included in the rate was excellent. Bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, cold meats, breads, yogurt, fruit juices etc. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Close to tons of restaurants.

<Content>The best hotel breakfast I've ever had The hotel Miramar is well-located in Frankfurt, in a lovely area very close to the Altstadt. The hotel itself is not impressive looking from the outside and the reception is ridiculously small but that is the worst criticism that I can give it. The room itself was lovely, the staff were friendly and I have never had as good a breakfast as I did at the Hotel Miramar. There was something the cater for all tastes (which is not always the case in hotels on mainland Europe) and I have to say I was really set up for the day of sightseeing after it. I really enjoyed my stay there and if I were to return to Frankfurt I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else.

<Content>plain and simple hotel with good location myself and my boyfriend went here for a long weekend in june, at first we found it hard to find the hotel and the locals didnt seem to know where it was either, probably jus our bad directions but when we found it eventually, its location is brilliant. its just a 5 minute walk to shops, and to a local pedestrian street which contains lots of little eateries and bars.the shops are also good which are just up at the top of the street .its such a canny little place, very delightful and quite beautiful if i must say, when we were there there was parades on in the town, with lots of stall offering any type of food u wanted to sample.the receptionist in the hotel was soo helpful, told us places to go to,drew out maps for us and directed us towards nice restaraunts, but we failed to enjoy any of the food over here.the hotel was basic but just what we needed as we didnt spend much time there. one of the receptionists was a bit unfriendly and even the male receptionist told us that-he had very good english.overall a very enjoyable stay , but we found that the 4days was enough for us in this city as we had ran out of things to do and seebut we would definately go back:)

<Content>Close to Christmas Market We stayed here for one night in late December on our way to Ireland. I reserved two rooms on the internet and had been impressed by the hotel's helpfulness and speed and ease in replying. The front desk staff were similarly pleasant and helpful when we arrived. Our rooms were small, as were the bathromms, but well heated and very clean. The breakfast was also good and all that we required. I chose the hotel because of its proximity to the centre of the city and the Christmas market, and indeed it was perfect for this. It was bitterly cold outside and it was great to be able to get back to the hotel in a couple of minutes. We were quite happy with our experience here and would definitely recommend it to others

<Content>Excellent value for money The Miramar is ideally placed for travellers wishing to visit the Christmas markets which are only a minute or so away by foot. Although the rooms are fairly small they are clean and comfortable with good shower rooms. The staff are very pleasant and accommodating and all speak excellent English. Breakfast was also excellent with a good variety of cereals, cold meats, cheese, fruit and bread.Over the weekend we stayed which was very close to Christmas there was always a plate of cookies/cake for guests on reception - a lovely touch.All round, this is a very reasonably priced hotel and the service provided is therefore excellent value. We would stay again.

<Content>Miserable Reservations Service Based on all the positive reviews I had read on this site, I made my reservation directly with this hotel in April 2007, for a stay in October 2007, during a fair and heavy season in Frankfurt. Everything was confirmed via email six months in advance and I was all set for my trip.Two weeks before my trip, the hotel manager sent me an email notifying me that they had accidentally double-booked the hotel for the fair and my reservation had been canceled. Furthermore, they had made a courtesy reservation for me and my family at a nearby hotel (near the train station). I did not want the reservation they made for me in a red light district hotel.Unfortunately, I was unable to find anything reasonable on such last minute in Frankfurt, so I ended up staying at a nearby town, instead of Frankfurt. My advise to anyone looking to book this hotel is to make sure you are not going during heavy season as you too may be accidentally bumped from this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic location, clean and reasonable price I have been going to Frankfurt for the last 4 years for the Christmas markets and have stayed at this hotel for 3 of those years (we left it too late to book for the 4th time!). The hotel costs around 拢90 for 2 nights bed and breakfast for 2 people which is fantastic value. The hotel is 2 minutes walk from the main markets and about 4 minutes walk to the high street. The rooms are small but always clean and well looked after.

<Content>Pleasant stay We stayed in an ensuite double room which was quite small but clean. It is located right by the old town and can be reached by the underground from the train station. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was basic- bread, jam/butter, juice/tea/coffee- but good. We were on the floor and had a good view of the skyscrapers from our window. Decent hotel.

<Content>Three Stars, But The Location Covers Anything Else We have stayed here for four nights me and my wife. First impression was not that good because the room was small (then I knew that all of europe hotels are like that).Also, the reception area was small, and didn't seem to have room service or any outlets.But as soon as I talked to the receptionist I have realized how friendly she is and all of the hotel staff. They all speak very good english, though they don't mind helping you to learn some german (some german people does not accept it). Since our purpose in Frankfurt is tourism, we needed alot of help, where the hotel staff were very glad to offer.The hotel is very clean and the location is the best part of the hotel, it is in the middle of the city center. Everything is close by Shops, Bars, Restaurants, Coffee Shops, and even Banks. The shopping area is less than a minute walk, and the historical area (National Musseum, Cathedral, and Others) are just behind the hotel. The river Rhine and its surrounding walking path is 3 minutes walk.Bottom line its worth every penny we have paid.

<Content>The Miramar Mix ..... A clean and comfortable hotel, with the bonus of free wireless internet for guests, and a good hearty breakfast included in the price. Very convenient for getting around the Altstadt, and not far from the cultural attractions of Frankfurt. Reasonable walking distance from the Hauptbahnhof. The staff are helpful and speak English. Like all smaller hotels in Germany the elevator is real slow (and small), at times you wonder if it's stopped, but it gets you there. The room decor is a bit startling, with more fake burr walnut panelling than you'd expect in a fake Rolls-Royce factory, and bright cheerful colours that somehow do work together but shouldn't. A good breakfast is included in the rate. I'd definitely use the Miramar again.

<Content>Perfect Miramar Going to our first Christmas market in Frankfurt we wanted to make sure we made the most of the limited time we had.We had a wonderful time which was helped in no small way by having booked the Hotel Miramar. It was easy to find just 10 minutes walk from the station. The staff were most friendly and helpful (especially Mary who appeared to cover the desk in the evenings), the whole hotel was clean, efficient and the best value for money we have had on several of what we call our 'Ryanair' weekends. The location could not be better and I would have no hesitation in recommending the Hotel Miramar to anyone.

<Content>Well located hotel This hotel is well located near the Dom and main shopping district with several good restaurants and pubs close by. Although our room was small, it was very clean and well furnished and equipped with mini bar and room safe. The reception staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast buffet was very good.

<Content>Pleasant stay We stayed at the Miramar for two nights in December. The hotel is in a good location being just around the corner from the Christmas Markets. Our room for three was pretty small. While staff were very friendly and helpful, there wasn't really that much going for the hotel except the location. The breakfast was just adequate and the lift could barely fit one person with their luggage. The decor in the room was also a bit faded. All in all though, if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in close proximity to the old town, then this isn't a bad choice.

<Content>The best location in town Stayed at the Miramar for two nights i September with my wife. The location was superb. Just aorund the corner from R枚mer/Altstadt and just two blocks from Zeil (Frankfurts main shopping street). The room was smaller than usual but was modern and in excellent condition. The breakfast also was nice. Highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very Good Hotel We stayed at the Miramar while visiting Frankfurt for 2 days on vacation. We found this small hotel to be very clean, quiet, and restful. The hotel receptionists were helpful and friendly and assisted us with ease. Breakfast was included and had sufficient assortment to meet most travelers needs. The Miramar was easily reached by the S line and only a few min from the main train station. Great Central location! We will definately stay at the Miramar again.

<Content>Good hotel in good location This hotel is in an excellent location around the corner from the Romerberg in the centre of the old town. I stayed here for 3 nights in June 2004. The single room was compact, but spotless and the bathroom (shower only, no bath tub) looked new. It had air conditioning and was very quiet. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They had a computer set up in reception and one could purchase a voucher from the hotel to connect to the internet via the computer, and while not cheap was very convenient. I would certainly consider staying here again if I ever return to Frankfurt.

<Content>Superb little Hotel My daughter and I booked this Hotel last year through the internet as we wanted a Hotel close to the Romer Christmas market. We were not disappointed. The Hotel was ideally placed for market and shops. Bedrooms, average size, brightly lit, very well appointed and spotlessly clean. Good substantial breakfast in a little intimate dining room. No teamaking facilities, however, which would have been appreciated as we had an early morning flight and were too early for breakfast. Extremely pleasant staff who posted my mobile phone to me free of charge. That's service!! Would definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone who wants to be in this area.
