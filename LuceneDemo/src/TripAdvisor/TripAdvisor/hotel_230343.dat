<Content>Near fairgrounds, quiet area It is a 3-star hotel in the nice residential area Westend. Walking distance to fairgrounds. Building from the 50's, where you sometimes have the feeling it might not be too clean when it actually is - just old and in need of some improvements (elevator small and old). Single room was tiny but a bargain at EUR 40 at a weekend.
