<Content>Great Location For Chase Field Games Two friends and I stayed here in late Sept. 2008, mainly to be within walking distance of Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The hotel is just 3 blocks away from the ball park, an easy walk. It saves time and money not having to deal with the hassle of parking. On the way is a nice pub, the Rose and Crown, which features excellent lunches during the day, and a wide variety of drinks at night. The hotel itself, besides being in a handy location, has many things going for it. The airport shuttle was prompt, just 12 minutes to arrive. The breakfast area is large, and besides the usual cold items, also has hot waffles, eggs, and sausage. The rooms have a desk area, a sofa and chair opposite the desk area, a small wet bar, fridge, and counter, comfortable beds, a separate bathroom sink area, and a good shower, complete with a real mat. The staff were all helpful and friendly. All in all, an excellent hotel at a good rate and location. I'd certainly stay here again when in Phoenix.

<Content>Pleasant Stay, Crappy Parking Lot I drove from LA to Pheonix non stop in the middle of the night after work on a Friday night to attend my Best Friend's Baby Shower in Pheonix. I should have just taken the day off and drove in the daylight. After a blowout on the 10 freeway at 100mph, and dealing with a AAA driver not knowing anything about how to work on a Mercedes, I was dead tired when I pulled into parking lot of SprillHill Suites in Pheonix around 3am Saturday morning. I checked in and found my nicely appointed room very inviting. I dont know whether it was my Hellish night or what, but that had to have been the best shower I have ever had in my life! The bed was soft and I crashed out pretty much the second my head hit the pillow.When I was walking towards my car, I noticed that it looked as though my trunk was open. I walked over to the rear and noticed that someone had drilled out the locking mechanism and openned my truck, stealing my laptop and the Baby gift I had gotten for my Best Friend. I was [-]! I confronted the front desk and they showed me a little paper stating the held no responsibilty to stolen property, which is standard for most Hotels. I called the Police, made a report and rushed to the Target nearby to get a replacement gift.After the shower, I was fortunate enough to find a Mercedes dealership with a service department open on Saturday. They replaced the lock and had to re-key the whole car costing me 900 dollars. I stayed 2 more nights at the hotel, waking up periodically to check to make sure my car was still there. The manager was nice enough to give me a discount on my stay, which eased my anger a bit. The hotel is nice, but I have beef with the parking lot and the [-] that stole my God Son's gifts.

<Content>Great hotel, great deal! We were looking for a hotel close to Chase Field. We traveled over Labor Day weekend. This hotel was very clean, the room was very spacious, the staff was friendly, attentive and welcoming and the room rate was a great deal. (We booked directly through the hotel's website)The free breakfast buffet was a lot better than other hotels that claim to have a buffet. (It wasnt top notch, but a lot better than we expected) Aside from Chase Field and The US Airways center, there isn't much around (walking distance) but it's conveniently located by the 10 freeway - so a short drive to others places. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic in every way We were exhausted after flying a red eye into Phoenix. We were picked up via complimentary shuttle at the airport and allowed to check in at 8:30 AM, almost unheard of. They then offered us complimentary breakfast upon check in. If you don't want to rent a car, this hotel is perfectly located not far from Chase Field and a number of restaurants. The room was spacious, beautifully appointed, and provided numerous amenities including FREE internet, a fitness room, and a more than adequate pool. Overall an A+++.

<Content>again, a nice experience we were in phoenix for my husband to take a workshop, i came along to shop and see friends. i wanted a place with a refrigerator, and free parking. the workshop was going to put us up in the hyatt or another, but the parking is over $25 a day, and not even a minibar. we had great times in the boise hotel and thought we would try thiis one. loved it. it fit all our needs, the beds are comfy, 2 tvs and large bathroom, very clean. we had the use of their milk, fruit ect from their breakfast room and brought it up to the room to add our nuts ect (health food nuts, we are) and then made sandwiches for hubby, along with fruit for his day. this hotel made this possible...i always like staying here and it met all our needs. looked better,and much more quiet than the hyatt.

<Content>Great Stay at the SpringHill Suites I recently completed a week-long stay at SpringHill and will echo the views of most of the writers below. Some AMENITIES include a free shuttle to/from the airport (until 11pm), a small snack shop selling chips, cookies, drinks, etc., and a free business center. There is also a laundry room on the 2nd floor, which as of this writing costs per load $1.00 to wash and $1.00 to dry. The STAFF is very helpful and provide quick check-in, great recommendations and directions. The LOCATION is not great if you don't have a car. Of course there is the bus system (the #3 stops right in front of the hotel), and the free DASH, which goes around the downtown area, stops about 3 blocks before getting to the hotel, along Van Buren. If you're not used to walking, it is a distance from the convention center (about 8 blocks) and very far from the arena where the Suns play (maybe 14 blooks); but closer to the baseball field and a 4 blocks from the Arizona Center (a small but relaxing mall).The ROOM was clean and a good size, had a very comfortable bed, one television, small refrigerator  microwave, coffee maker and plenty of lighting. The sink is separate from the tub/toilet, which may allow more than one person to get ready for the day, and there is a decent-sized closet and plenty of drawer space.The BREAKFAST was very good, especially if you're going to be in workshops all day. There is hot food - including waffles, eggs  sausage, cereal, fruit, yogurt, muffins, juice, etc. Only know that it's the same setup every day, so pick and choose your daily selections knowing that if you don't have something today, you can have a shot at it tomorrow.

<Content>Good value but not great for walking to the convention center, or anywhere else This hotel is a great deal but the location isn't good if you think you're going to go anywhere on foot.First the good--the rooms were great for business travel and I appreciated the free wireless internet and the better-than-average free breakfast. Nothing was fancy but everything was clean and in good shape. I liked the setup of the room--there was a little office area and a little living room area and a comfy bed. The downside was really about Phoenix more than the hotel--you can't walk *anywhere* safely, especially as a woman and most especially at night. The convention center is not far away but I was the only person on foot except for some very disturbed homeless people, so I had to take 5-minute cab rides every day. There is no real food onsite except for breakfast, and there are not a lot of good places to eat downtown and none within walking distance. Skip the mexican food at Sam's at the local mall unless you are desperate.

<Content>Good alternative for central Phoenix When the other main places to stay downtown are the Hyatt Regency and the Wyndham - and you're not getting a convention rate - then this is definitely the place to stay. My husband and I were here for two nights, just as tourists. We do need to travel with our laptop, and found the high-speed (wired) internet service to be quick  easy to access.We are Marriott Rewards Points members, and used points to stay here free, but got no extra perks, since the place was full when we checked in. We called from Sky Harbor airport, and their shuttle took us right to the hotel. The room was basically the same as all other Springhills, with a desk-living area, small fridge, and sofa with coffee table. A big coffeepot too, and a huge bathroom area, with large but separate toilet  shower. Roomy closet with plentiful hangers  luggage stand, plus ironing board and iron.The included breakfast buffet was HUGE, and enough was always on hand even though all the rooms were full. The TV channels were rather limited for being in a big city, but the Manager told me she's aware of the problem and is working with the cable company to remedy that. She and another employee also went out of her way to do us several favors. When I needed to get to a drugstore to get some personal items, she took the shuttle van and personally drove me to a Wal-Green's!There are no restaurants right near the hotel, however we found plenty at the Arizona Center just 5 blocks down (highly recommend Sam's Cafe), as well as in a few other areas. Heritage Square was close by, and anything else we wanted to get to was reachable by using the city's FREE DASH busses - they are great!

<Content>Way Nicer Than I Expected! I just spent 5 nights at the SpringHill Suites Phoenix Downtown and cannot think of one negative thing to say. The staff were amazing, especially the front desk. The location was a big dodgy, but only 3 blocks from Chase Stadium. The rooms were spacious and the beds were very comfortable. Great value for the $$. We really enjoyed relaxing in the swimming pool and hot tub, despite the 114 degree weather. :) I just want to accentuate how helpful everyone was. The front desk lady was always eager to help us with directions. We never made it to the breakfast, but from what I heard it was delicious. If I ever go to Phoenix again, I will definitely consider staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Mixed-up reservations I had heard this was a nice place and booked reservations because it's close to Chase Field and US Airways Arena. I booked through hotel's web site. Requested smoking room and got the message not available. Tried non-smoking and got the same message! I called the hotel and was assured I could have a smoking room. When I arrived to check in, no smoking rooms were available. Was told I could have a first-floor room and stand outside and smoke in 110 degree weather. No thanks. This is a good location. Just wish the desk people could get their act together. Ended up going someplace else.

<Content>Very nice little hotel Of all the hotels/motels I stayed in on my Arizona trip, this was the nicest and cleanest. It had a convenient and free airport shuttle, a decent sized room, adequate amenities, very good continental breakfast (eggs, sausage patties, waffles, toast, muffins, fruit, cereal, yogurt, etc.), comfortable beds, etc. The location was a little dicey, but then I gather downtown Phoenix can be that way too. It's walking distance to the convention center, some of the main hotels, and the stadium stuff. Staff were very pleasant. This is a good pick for business travellers.

<Content>Great Staff, Would highly recomend Stayed here for a business convention. The manager was a very nice lady and caring. Had a mix-up with our daughter arriving late and the desk clerk told her they could not pick her up after 11:00pm with the hotel shuttle. I was having a conversation with the manager the next morning and told her about it. She promply paid me for the cab fair I had to pay to get my daughter there even though I told her I did not want it. She paid the amount $20.00 even on my word. The staff was very freindly, the rooms clean. I stayed for 7 days was always greeted with very freindly staff. I would recomend this motel to anybody.

<Content>Great Springhill Suites We were looking for a hotel near the government offices and found this Springhill Suites, a chain we've enjoyed in several other cities including Scottsdale and Las Cruces, NM. Ths was a real find.....very new, very clean, excellent front desk service and a really nice breakfast. When we checked in the receptionist offered us cold bottles of water. The breakfast included belgian waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal and some wonderful fresh fruit containers and yogurt that could be taken right from the small glass front refrigerator. This is one of the nicest Springhill Suites we've found. Price was great, too!

<Content>Most Marriotts are wonderful this one was AWFUL  i was told by the desk in phoenix i didnt need a credit card to check in if i was paying cash, so i didnt bring it with me. they wouldnt check me in till i got them a copy of the credit card. so someone had to run all over town to get them a photocopy of this credit card so they check me in. It took me 2 hours to check in. I should of left at that point. but because marriott are very good places, i decided to stay. when i got to my room it was freezing cold. ( penguins could of ice skated in the bathroom) so i turned off the ac thinking this is phoenix and in 10 minits it be hotter than blue blazes in here. So i left the room when i came back that night it was still cold. So i turned on the heat and the fire alarm went off. When i called to complain they told me they give me points for the stay and as to say there sorry all i got as 1000 for there sorry and NONE for staying there. i called them back and they tried to say i payed less than i did but i had the reciept so they had to give me the correct point (this only took 2-3 phone calls) Finally a manger called and gave me 10000 points unstead of a free stay (would you wanna go back after that) . will I ever stay at that hotel again? HECK NO! Dont get me wrong about marriott hotels MOST are real nice ones. If you stay in full service marriott, or a courtyard they are wonderful hotel you will be fine. Ive even been told the Residence Inn are quite nice. Ive never stayed in one of them myself. This perticular hotel is a disaster! so dont make the mastake of staying in this hotel
