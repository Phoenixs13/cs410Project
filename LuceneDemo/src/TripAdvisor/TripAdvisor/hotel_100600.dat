<Content>Do NOT give them the keys to your car Tonight the Wife  I sat across the street from this Hotel and while raining witnessed a hotel employee moving cars around the lot. The first one was a White Honda Accord. He red lined the engine, then dumped it in reverse. Slid to a stop, then dropped it in forward and lurched forward spinning out. He went back  forth a few times before driving off. Then he went and got a Red Volkswagon Bug (new style) and proceeded to do the same exact thing. I called and the guy (with an obvious Indian accent) said his name was John and the Manager was on vacation. I was flabbergasted. We have used this lot for park  fly before numerous times, they have GREAT rates. Now we know why, never again.

<Content>Manager Cheats Customers I was given specific quotes over the phone, verified them twice before arrival. Upon arrival, the manager raised the price and would not give me two reciepts for two separate transactions because he wanted to save a buck (.50) . He raised the room price by 10.00 for each night. He was loud, rude and very unfriendly. I heard him even yelling at other customers. They stated they had another company to run the bus/van to airport/downtown, when in fact it is their own van, own employees, who rasied the price again. He again, wanted to squeeze in too many people, busting our bags, in order to save a trip that 5 of us were told we would have a van to ourselves. (Phone conversations should be taped). Not only did the rooms smell but they were dirty. Sheets had stains all over them, towels had blood stains. The manager argued with me to the point where he was yelling and not allowing me to talk. Refrigerator smelled like something died. The other staff were friendly and even verified the conversation, but the manager was totally disrespectful. Always get the name of the person you speak with as this helped me verify. I will never stay here again, unless they get rid of the manager. His name is Parnit. the address is 13910 International Blvd. Seattle. WA

<Content>Go somewhere else Let's start off on a good note. The staff was great. Very nice and helpful. Perhaps I got them on a good day.Now for the rest. The price was variable and I feel too costly for the quality I got. Rooms were small. Linen was old and sometimes tattered but clean. Locks on bathroom door did not work. Bathroom renovations were cheap and poorly constructed. Obviously not a contracted job. Rooms were clean but not that clean. The continental breakfast was a joke. Watered down juice, packaged doughnuts, a bowel of hard boiled eggs, old cereal, stale mini bagels, a brick a butter and a tub of cream cheese. Very unsanitary! The neighbourhood is close to the airport but is very poor and messy. The rollaway cot had a mattress that was completely void of any padding what so ever, plus the wheels kept coming off.I recommend you pay a little extra and go somewhere else that's nicer. I would not pay more than $40 a night for this place and I'm being generous!

<Content>I wish there was a rating lower than "terrible." Ihave never stayed in a more appalling place in my life. We stayed there for the last night of a long trip because we had to catch a 6 am flight. The whole place was filthy, starting with the bum passed out under a mattress propped against the side of the building. The halls were littered with cribs and folding beds, the decor was more crack house than economy hotel, and those are just the things we saw before getting to our room. I felt like I should have been wearing a haz mat suit in that place! The bathroom was gross, and there was no water pressure unless we turned the water to extreme cold or extreme hot. If was one enough of a snob to prefer warm water, the shower heard merely drooled. Something had been ripped off the wall at some point, leaving large holes in the wall, but the wall was not repaired. Similar issues in the bathroom. The icing on the cake (only because I did not have one of those lights that show all the bodily fluids on the bedspread, nightstand, ceiling, etc.) was the fact that the door frame was damaged from an apparent break-in attempt. It probably goes without saying, but we did not meet our goal of getting a good night鈥檚 sleep before our flight home. Frankly, I consider myself lucky to have survived the stay without contracting a horrible infection or being attacked.

<Content>disgusting dirt bag hotel complete with trashy fight out front at 2am! my husband and I stayed here for 1 night and we were just looking for a cheap place to sleep before we flew out of SeaTac the next day. well, cheap comes in every form here. from the creepy guy sitting at the computer all night long looking up naughty websites, to the arguing couple out front at 2am that led to the police showing up... the free breakfast is just cereal and coffee, the jacuzzi is smaller than a bathtub and we didn't go in it in fear of catching some kind of rash, and the gym facilites is just an exercise bike.this place smelled bad and was so dirty, i couldn't wait for morning to come. we vowed to each other that we will never ever stay at a place like this again. on the other hand, the guy at the front desk was very nice and helpful, and the rest of the staff was ok too. they probably feel really bad for the people that decide to stay there!

<Content>They will crash your car and blame it on you First of all I paid to park my car on their lot for two weeks think that this would be a safe and secure choice. I was very wrong. I get back and find my front bumper scratched. I made numerous complaints, just to get the run around from the staff (who can barely speak English). The manager is never in, they will not give the name, and don鈥檛 know when they will be in. I am also told that I must have done it prior to parking on their lot and that their staff could not have done it, even though they constantly move the cars around at the back of their lot.The room was a mess with pubic hair sprinkled throughout. There was a little in the tub, some on the counter, and even one on the TV remote.I wouldn't even recommend it to someone I didn't like,

<Content>older hotel, but ok It was an older hotel and a little worn. We had a big room with comfortable beds. Everything was clean, and the bathroom was huge but it had a tiny shower. Very close to the airport and we understood they offered a park  stay, for people flying out or cruising out of Seattle. The breakfast was almost nonexistant. They only offered a couple of cold cereals, prepackaged sweet rolls and juice  coffee. This was located in the small lobby, so there was only a small couch  a small table  chairs to sit at  eat. The staff was very friendly though. They also had a computer in the lobby, which made it handy to print out boarding passes the evening before. There is a mini casino across the street and we had a decent dinner there. There was also a bus stop across the street, so we were able to catch the city bus  ride into downtown Seattle to sightsee.

<Content>Crack House This is by far the worse hotel I've ever stayed in. We booked a park and ride because our flight left a 5:30 AM, and we live an hour away. Didn't want to wake up too early, but I rather stay up all night than to sleep in that hole. The place is a filthy mess. We really did not expect much, but this was as bad as it gets. The sheets had stains on them, the bath was full of hair from the previous customer and the place smelled terrible. The only thing good was that we got out of there at 3:30 AM, so we didn't have to see the place in the daylight.
