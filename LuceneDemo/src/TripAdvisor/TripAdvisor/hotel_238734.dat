<Content>Don't stay unless your willing to pay cash I've never written a hotel review before, as I've always had good experiences in hotels, but I felt compelled to write something, to warn other travelers considering this place. It was a small room, to say the least. We maybe had a foot on either side of the bed, so you either had to be in the bathroom or in the bed. The view from our window was of a brick wall that was about 2 feet away, obviously letting no natural light in. The little TV only had a few stations and were Spanish speaking only. The construction next door was always a pleasant awakening, even on a Saturday. As for the staff, there were some nice and some not, and some were English speaking, which was good. We never got any clean towels or a room cleaning for a 6 nights stay. We saw a sign about their credit card machine not working a few days into our stay, and were relieved when it wasn't there a few days before we left, but when we went to check out, she brought out the sign again. (Is that anyway to run a hotel business? shouldn't that be a priority to fix??) She pointed us to an ATM, expecting us to pay with only cash for a weeks stay. Apparently they've never heard of a daily withdrawl limit. Seemed like a pretty big tourist scam to me. Our saving grace was the WiFi cafe right next door.I'd recommend getting a hostel with a private bath, it would probably be nicer and cheaper.

<Content>Barcelona Location is a 10min walk from the Barcelona Nord bus station, so was very convenient for us as we got there late at night. About a 5-10min walk to the Barri Gotic side of Las Rambles, so quite convenient location if you don麓t want to be in the middle of Las Rambles. Zoo is accross the road.Rooms were smallish but modern and quite fashionable, no complaints. Our room near reception was a little noisy but nothing too bad. TV reception not great and all in Spanish.Staff were average, and cleanliness was good.Beware lift is old and small, and reception is a couple of flights up.

<Content>A great Little Hotel This is a fantastic little hotel. Dont let first looks put you off. When you arrive it looks like you are going into a block of flats. The hotel is in fact on 1 floor for a very large building. You have to go up 2 fligths of stairs or use the very old fashioned lift.The hotel is has vey Mondern decor and is equipt with a vending machine for drinks and snacks.I found the hotel staff very friendly and could not be more happy to help.The rooms. Walking past some of the rooms they are all diffrent sizes. We had a rather large room wich was very clean and had a TV saftey deposit box and a luvley shower and bathroom. The walls are rather tin though and you can hear everything going on in the hotel. I would not say its noisy there but if you are a light sleeper might not be the best idea. The area was good there were some nice restaurant and cafes on the walk to the centre which are a lot cheaper than eating in all the tourist places. It takes about a 15 min walk to the main street. All in all we enjoyed our stay and would recoment this hotel for a short city break. PS i am a travel agent so can be very picky with my hotel choices.

<Content>run !! Hotel put us last minute in an apartment cross town when we arrived. Said there was a problem with our toilet. We took a train to a bus to a plane, walked 25 minutes in foreign city to find this out. Walked another 15 to apt. to meet employee? with a key. Could smell bug fumigation smell in delux apartment. Two dead cockroaches on the floor. Employee took our credit card inside room and ran it through portable machine. Said transaction did not go through, ripped up receipt. Walked us down to an ATM so we could withdrawl cash! I made him write handwritten receipt. Employee spoke no english, we spoke little spanish. Assured us we would not see double transaction, and of course 5 days later we did. Took us many emails and bank phone contacts to straighten it out. Hotel assures us this was not a 'scam but an oversight. You decide. Finally got credit for additional charges. Did not have any room service over the 3 night stay, no fresh towels, soap or toiletpaper. To the plus side...it was a good location to everything. Price was reasonable. Area appeared safe.

<Content>Triunfo only good as a last resort The Triunfo is a fairly crummy little hotel. We were prepared for small and basic, since we were looking in the budget range. But the Triunfo was extremely noisy (particularly the ancient elevator), incredibly cramped (it was difficult for both of us to stand in the room at the same time, unless one of us was standing right next to the window - essentially, one of us had to be sitting on the bed at all times), dark, not terribly clean, and not terribly hospitable. They also said at the outset that they took credit cards, and then reneged.The rooms do not all have balconies overlooking the Parc Ciutadella, as promised. Ours had a window looking into an internal chute of some kind -so we kept the shade down. The location was OK, but not ideal. We ended up in this hotel only because we were staying for more than a week and every other hotel we tried was booked during part of that time. I would not stay there again.
