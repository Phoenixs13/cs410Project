<Content>Really great hotel!! We were quite surprise by this hotel! It was not too expensive (summer 2007) and it was really pleasant. It is located in a very quiet neighborhood less than 10 minutes away from a subway station. The restaurant was very good and the staff of the restaurant really friendly. Room was clean, modern and big for a European hotel! We really enjoyed our stay and will return at the Zenit next time we go to Barcelona.

<Content>food poisoning in the hotel my wife and I both suffered mild food poisoning during our stay at the Zenit Hotel Barcelona,due we are certain, to constantly re heated food in the hotel restaurant. After our experience and the negative way we were treated after filling in the complaint form (hoja de reclamaciones) we would strongly advise against staying in this hotel.

<Content>Nice surprise I stayed in this hotel 3 nights in October with a friend of mine. When I booked the hotel I was a little bit concerned about the location as it was quite away from the famous La Ramblas. However, when we finally arrived at the hotel it was a wonderful surprise as the hotel was in a fantastic location amongst several interesting shops and restaurants. Plus it was not far from the part called Gracia where we spent most of the evenings. The hotel was really clean, staff very helpful and friendly and the breakfast really generous in choice. I would definitely recommend this hotel for short or longer stay. It's a little bit pricey, but worth it.

<Content>Lovely hotel I stayed in this hotel for three nights in April 2007. From Muntaner station, it is a five-ten minute walk down a hill - which means that, if you want to travel by Metro, it is a five-ten-fifteen minute walk each morning UP a hill! However, there are buses nearby and not uphill (and a travel pass covers trains, trams and buses) but we found that travelling anywhere by bus, with all the traffic in the city, meant losing an hour of the day.The hotel itself is really lovely. It is set in a residential area, which means that many of the people around do not speak English but they were all very friendly and happy to help with directions. It also means that you feel as though you are getting to see the real Barcelona. The hotel staff themselves do speak very good English and are also very friendly and happy to help. The room was clean and inviting and had extras (all wrapped) such as a sweet each evening, tissues, a toothbrush and a comb. Each room had a balcony - there were eight floors and two lifts available.We did not eat at the hotel during our stay - we are sure it is very nice but there were lots of other places to try within easy walking distance.We had a very enjoyable stay here and would be very happy to return.

<Content>Good Place to stay My husband I stayed at the Zenit Barcelona for four nights over Xmas 23 - 27 Dec 2006. The hotel itself was nice and modern with a nice bar area and restaurant. We booked through Booking.com and they had a special offer on that meant we had breakfast included. The breakfast buffet was really good, it included cereal, fruit, Spanish meats, tortilla, bacon  eggs and some really nice pastries. The waiting staff where really nice and friendly, spoke excellent English and even attempted to help us with our Spanish which is a work in progress. The room was nicely decorated, very quiet and had excellent climate control. My only criticism would be that it was a little on the small side and I suspect that it was probably a room that was meant as a double for single use. It didn't matter that much though because we were hardly ever there.A previous guest reviewed that it was to far from the centre but we found the public transport that served the area to be really good even on Xmas and Boxing Day. Getting to the hotel from town, you can catch the number 14 bus from Catalunya square, just outside the El Corte Ingles. The bus stop is right outside the hotel. To go into the centre you can walk over two blocks to Calle de Calvet and catch the 14, this bus even goes down Las Ramblas, to Barceloneta and to the Cituadella Park. Alternatively there are two buses that travel town Calle de Muntaner. You can also walk up Santalo and catch the FGC to Catalunya Square. We bought the 5 day metro, train and bus pas which cost 鈧?0 each although I think I would be tempted to get the T10 ticket next time which allows you ten journeys and only costs 鈧?.00.If you want a really useful website for Barcelona info, accommodation and an excellent map go to bcn.es
