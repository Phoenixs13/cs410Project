<Content>Lovely place I stayed in Sofitel Frankfurt Savigny for 3 nights during a business trip in May.I like the hotel: it is clean, quiet, the staff is friendly and helpful. The room had air conditioner, the bed was comfortable. One can use internet for free in reception area. I liked breakfasts, although I've been dissapointed to know they are not included in room's cost and quite expensive (19 EUR for contenental one).The hotel's location is great: the Savignystrasse is beautiful and quiet, and it is within walking distance from both messe centers and city sights.I liked the place and I certainly would stay there again, but only for company's expense - to my mind the only disadvantage is the price of accomodation.

<Content>Great Location for Frankfurt Messe Stayed in this hotel for a recent business trip to Frankfurt. As it was midweek, the rate of 330 Euro/night was to be expected, but for that amount of money I expected the room to be a bit larger. The room had 2 comfortable twin beds pushed next to each other, with about 1.5 feet on each side between the wall and the beds. In addition, there was a small writing desk and a wing chair near the foot of the bed. The room was quiet at night. The bathroom looked like it had been recently remodeled, though I still do not understand why so many European hotels insist on not installing a full shower/bath door. To avoid getting water all over the bathroom, one has to stand directly under the showerhead, jammed up against the wall and not move around too much. Being 6'2, this is difficult at best. The hotel restaurant was very good for both breakfast and dinner. This was lucky as there did not seem to be much choice other than take away restaurants in the surrounding area. The hotel is conveniently located to both the Frankfurt train station and the Frankfurt Messe fairgrounds. Both are within 10-15 minutes walk. Check-in and Check-out were quick and easy

<Content>A good hotel for business Hi This is a good business hotel, would not stay there for pleasure, but who goes to Frankfurt for pleasure!You can walk to most of the city from the hotel and it is max 10 minutes to the train station. Try to stay in the new part of the hotel if you can, breakfast is OK but with all hotels over priced.A good priced place and good location - falls within my companies budget

<Content>NOT!!! Sofitel Quality!!! Hotel is located just 2 blocks from Hauptbanhof (Central Train Station) Very Convenient...HOWEVER!!! This hotel is not up to Sofitel Standards. The first suite we got, had a leaky radiator heater, the carpet was all wet next to the bed. We were assigned a second suite wich was better, although the heated floor in the bathroom was not working, the decor in both rooms was very tired looking, the hotel needs a complete remodel. The hotel staff was very cordial, polite and resolved our problems right away.

<Content>Adequate Hotel; Terrible Value This is an adequate hotel, but the room and bathroom were ridiuclously small and the air conditioning did not seem to be working despite the (unseasonably) warm weather. The hotel has a sort of modern, international look, but is not at all distinctive. But the most outrageous thing was the 460 Euro room rate. Even in New York, $600 gets you a suite at a fine hotel such as the Waldorf or the Palace. This place was like a cramped Holiday Inn Express.

<Content>Good location but? We stayed here for three days in Feb. We found this to be a good location very close to the main rail station less than a 10min walk. The hotel fronts to a quiet street with an old church and homes, yet to the side is a large office tower. This location is great cause it is quiet and not far from shopping and food.Frankfurt is an easy city to walk cause it is very compact. This not a very large hotel compared to other chain properties in Frankfurt, its about five floors in two separate but connected buildings. We were in what appeared to be the older back part. The lobby was nice and bright warm colors and nice decor if a bit small. The restaurant was also a bit small but nicely furnished and confortable. The morning buffet was limited and pricey. As was dinner . There are many better and less expensive reastaurants in the area including a nice Brittish restaurant/pub called the Fox and Hound behind the Sofitel. Now on to the rooms, very small and a bit dingy both in need of remodeling. I say both because we had to switch rooms because the beds in the first room were old and worn out . We had two twin beds and at least my bed had a saggy side and very springy. The second room was much improved. In both the pillows were lumpy and old, two extra pillows were ordered and helped a bit. The bathroom however was very nice and a good size compared to the room. Everything was clean but just in need of an update. The staff was hit-n-miss, some very nice . All in all its an ok hotel in a good spot in need of some remodeling. I would stay here again if the price was right. I got a good deal on this stay.

<Content>Clean Hotel but Don't Like It Stayed here over Christmas of 2006 with a friend. Must say there is really nothing wrong with the hotel itself but would not consider it to be Sofitel standard.The room we got was very small and pokey...with a very musty smell to go!The location wasn't too bad being convenient to the main station but a little bit of a hike to the Old Town Square.Like previous posting the hotel has a depressing atmosphere and is a little lifeless...nothing to rave about or promote.Very average experience and nothing to write home about.

<Content>A very good hotel, but I don't like it! I stay here regularly on business, and in fairness, cannot fault the hotel in terms of quality of service, decor, cleanliness etc. The food is also very good indeed. I agree with another poster who says it has no soul - I have no reason to dislike it, but I do!It is extremely convenient for my office and for the main station (I can't comment on anything else, as don't go there) and is in a nice neighbourhood. I actually find it a rather depressing hotel, and think that this is because of the soullnessness of it, there really is nothing else to fault. Room service is fairly limited if you want to eat a meal, although is extremely nice - I had a fish I had never heard of and the standard was perfect and the presentation faultless. Big breakfast as well if you have it brought up, really good selection. I believe it's rather expensive if you're not on an inclusive rate.There is 1 English-language channel which is extremely poor - and what's more, it's one of those news channels which constantly gives you the same news every 30 minutes! I do feel that especially when you are away on business on your own, a bit of telly is often just what you need. Even though it's a German hotel and you can't expect a huge selection in other languages, they have 3 or 4 French and 2 or 3 Italian, so it does seem we are getting a bit of a raw deal!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Located on a quiet one way street in a residential area, this hotel is really nice and the service is excellent. It is only a few minutes by taxi from the train station. This is my new home from now on when I arrive and depart in Frankfurt.

<Content>Very good value indeed I stayed here for two nights in March 2006. The hotel is modern with an older wing, I stayed in the modern end. The rooms are clean, comfortable and well-kitted. My only criticism of the room is the single intermittent English-language channel on the TV - which seems unfair considering there are 35 channels to choose from!The restaurant/bar is clean, friendly, has a pretty good menu and is utterly devoid of any soul whatsoever, even by the standards of business hotels. Try one of the bars around the corner if you fancy going out.That said, I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>fabulous hotel- but thank god I got a very cheap rate Stayed here while attending a trade fair at the nearby Messe. Fortunately I got a superb deal from the hotel's own web site, because usually it is quite expensive.The staff was very professional and gave good dining suggestions. I didn't try the buffet breakfast because it's pretty expensive and I don't eat that much!The room was very functional and comfortable. It was very cold outside but I was super comfy in the room. The shower's are amazing!!Would return to the Sofitel, provided the price is right.

<Content>Quietly located halfway beteween City Center and Trade Fair Grounds This smaller property could be overlooked from the outside. The white exterior looks a bit dated but from the inside the hotel offers modern amenities and a sense of charme and coziness. Rooms tend to becsmall but some offer balconies. Locationwise, the hotel is located on a quite street at the entrance to a high-quality neighbourhood. Expect to walk 20 minutes either to the trade fair, the train station or the shopping area. There is no subway station in the direct vicinity (about 10 minutes away). If you want to avoid the crowds at the larger places this could be your choice. Another major hotel close-by is the Hotel Hessischer Hof (5 star property, closer to the trade fair grouds, and surprise: from time to time cheaper than the Sofitel).
