<Content>City centre? 4 stars? I dont think so! This hotel is not located near the main tourist attractions as indicated. This could be overcome by providing a reasonable service which didn't happen. They could not find our booking for half an hour despite me having a confirmation from Easyjet. Then we were given twin rooms (not triple). When we pointed this out to recpeption they laughed (but did fix the problem). Rooms were basic but clean. I find it hard to understand how this is 4 star with in either provisions or service.

<Content>Can't beat it! We have stayed in this hotel many times over the last few years. The staff are always very friendly and helpful. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast is really great too!The location is not in the city centre - that's why they call the hotel City Centre East - the clue is in the name! But you do get to stay in Prenzlauer Berg, and the tram stops literally opposite the front door - which is very convenient - a short ride from Alexander Platz. Or you could walk 4 mins to the nearest S Bahn.It's a great location for seeing the east side of Berlin, and easy to get to the city centre.It's great value too, considering it often costs only around 70 euros a night.We're staying again soon.

<Content>Friendly Staff Stayed six days here in Spring so got to know the hotel quite well. Immediate impression was that the staff were very pleasant and helpful and I was right to think so. The room was clean with a large bathroom and was a bit of an odd shape but somehow that grew on me. I paid around 70 euros per night which was about right. Breakfast was Hol Inn standard in a spacious breakfast room. About a five minute walk to the S-bahn, or go outside front of hotel for the tram.

<Content>Good value for budget minded visitors Just returned from a 2 night stay here over the weekend. This review will echo the positives of other contributions. This is a budget hotel and relative to that broad classification offers good value and comfort:Rooms - good size, comfortable if blandly furnishedBathroom - larger than normal for budget categoryStaff - at all times friendly, responsive and efficientBreakfast - good variety/qualityLocation - not a problem, yes its a residential area and may be not much to write home about but it wasn't noisy and we certainly felt safe enough. Personally, I cannot imagine how, with a tram stop right outside the door and an S-Bahn station 500m away, anyone could feel this was too far away from the Mitte, etc., its only a 10 minute tram ride to Alexanderplatz !Downside - yes, the bistro is not great in terms of decor or menu but there are many good places to eat/drink a couple of tram stops away, i.e. within walking distance, e.g. Kollwitzstrasse, Knaackstrasse. If you don't want to walk more than 50m for food, get yourself a picnic from the Netto underneath or the Lidl over the road and eat in your room but that would be missing the variety of places down the road.We would stay here again for its combination of value and location.

<Content>Great hotel but not the best location Stayed here for 2 nights in April 2007.The Hotel itself was great - clean, nice room, great buffet breakfast included and friendly staff.However its location is a good 20 minutes away from anything that you want to see.I wouldn't stay here again because I would want to stay closer to the city and to the sites.

<Content>The East's The Best! We have stayed in all sorts of hotels - and private houses - in Berlin, both West and East, over the past 35 years. We hit on the Holiday Inn in Prenzlauer Allee 5 years ago, and have stayed there every summer since. It's a modern hotel with a friendly, knowledgable, English-speaking staff and has wonderful transport links to the city centre - tram and bus stops outside the front door, and an S-Bahn station five minutes down the road. But its great strength is its location. Prenzlauer Berg is marvellous, packed with good bars and restaurants, interesting bookshops etc. The atmospheric centre of the area is Kollwitzplatz, named after the Berlin sculptor Kathe Kollwitz, whose statue is in the little park in the centre. It's a great place to sit out on a summer 's evening and watch the world go by. Since the fall of the Wall - nearly 20 years ago now! - the great streets of East Berlin - Friedrichstrasse and Unter den Linden - have recovered their old glories. Prenzlauer Allee is within easy reach of both.

<Content>Very Uneven A nice property, but isolated from the city itself. The staff was nice, the rooms were okay but the a/c did not work. I notified the front desk 3 times and they promised it was being worked on. Needless to say, it never got fixed on a warm Berlin day and night. If you want a clean room, at a good price this property is okay. Be advised you must take a long tram commute, then a subway ride to wherever you want to visit.

<Content>Great experience, great staff I stayed there for five nights in May 2007. The hotel is a new property and the rooms are pretty big, roomy, with modern nice decoration, light slightly scant. The location is not great, but it depends what you are in Berlin for. If you are interested in the Eastern part of the city and the Museuminsel, then it is pretty good. You have one bus stop just outside the hotel, bus number 158, you can take it to the end of line (five or six stops), Michelangelostrasse and take the 200 from there, or the TXL to the airport. You can also use the streetcar, number M2 (frequency 10 min) , that leaves you in Hackescher Markt very near the Museuminsel. Or you can walk about five minutes north and take the streetcar number 12 (frequency 20 min) and it leaves you in Friedrichstrasse. So it is pretty convenient for the whole eastern part of the city. Not so for the western part. It is great to have one supermarket under the hotel and another one just in front of it but the area is not so great for restaurants. My advice: Take the streetcar M2 to either Kollwitzplatz (Station Marienburgerstrasse) or Helmotzplatz (Station Prenzlauer Allee / Danziger Strasse) and you can find plenty of places there. Otherwise the area where the hotel is located is in the north part of Prenzlauer Berg, full of Berliners but not many tourists. The hotel lobby is unimpressive, the minigym just adequate, but the breakfast is ok and the price is also good (paid 90 euros per night for a double room including breakfast through the holiday inn website). Staff is really helpful. Room service is not good but cheap. All in all, a good experience.

<Content>Great Hotel, crummy location I absolutely loved this hotel but I didn't like the location at all. From a European hotel perspective this place had massive rooms which were very well appointed. Quite a difference from the rest of Europe. It is however pretty far from everything. I'm not a huge fan of public transport (having done my fair share and not needing to do it anymore) but this place almost forces you to take the U-Bahn around town. Having said that, I do remember that I got a great price here, probably to make up for the lack of location, location, location. Berlin is an absolutely incredible city - the best in Germany for sure and it's too bad that I spent a lot of my time moving around Berlin instead of being able to walk around the city from a more central hotel. Would I stay there again? No. Which is a pity in a way, since it was really a nice property.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel What a great Hotel!! This was the first hotel my partner and i stayed after being on a 18-25's tour around Europe. After an array of poor hotels with the tour, this hotel was absolutely fantastic!! We stayed at about 10 4 star hotels after our tour and this hotel was the best due to its location and quality. It is conveniently located within 5 minutes walk of a train station. The staff are very friendly and helpful and speak reasonably good english. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and come with a decent sized bathroom. The breakfast is absolutely amazing!!! It is a buffet to die for. Make sure you get to breakfast early though, because the juice runs out quickly!!

<Content>Good hotel... but bistro?? We have just returned from a three-night trip to Berlin. I agree with the previous reviews re the location, friendliness of the staff, the spotless hotel room and the great breakfasts. I would add, however, that the Bistro and the bar are in the lobby; the bistro in a small sectioned-off area and the bar doubles as the reception counter. We had the pizza and pasta which was Ok but I'm not sure it had been prepared on the premises (microwave anyone??). However, it was late at night and at least we could get something to eat on arrival rather than venturing out, but a bistro just conjures up more ambiance and better quality food.

<Content>Very Good Arrived with friends and was greeted by friendly and professional reception staff. Throughout the stay they were at all times friendly and helpful with local and hotel information. Rooms were of a good standard with modern and clean decor. Beds comfortable and bathroom large and comfortable. Room TV good, great selection of German and European/US channels. Towels not changed daily unless you leave then in a heap on the flooe. View nothing to write home about but no road noise or disturbances. Breakfast in hotel was excellent with a large choice of fresh food, perhaps the staff could have been quicker with the drinks (tea and coffee).Hotel has a well equipped gym, if only it had a pool/sauna/spa - but then the price would be higher I guess.As for location, for the price it is great, the tram stops right outside and takes you straight to the city centre for a very small fee, runs until late at night. Surrounding area may not look to much but there are some great bars and restaurants nearby in the local squares. We felt entirely comfortable walking around of an evening and found the locals helpful and very courteous. I would return to Berlin and stay here again, good value, good location, good staff.

<Content>Not As Good As It Used To Be I fully agree with the comments of many reviewers about the convenient location. I would also add that the staff is among the nicest you will find anywhere. This was my second stay and, unfortunately, the hotel maintenance is not what it used to be. The light darkening curtains in my room, for example, were falling off their tracks due to poorly designed plastic hooks. This was not corrected during my stay. And in the nice shower, there was noticeable mildew growing which could have been corrected with a bit of chlorine. Moreover, the once free high speed internet access now costs about 15 Euros a day! That changed three days before I arrived and, needless to say, I was not pleased. But overall, it you get a good price, you will be satisfied with this hotel. Except for the mildew, the cleanliness was excellent.

<Content>Very nice hotel I stayed in the Radisson SAS Berlin the last time I was in Berlin, but chose the Holiday Inn this time because it is near my daughter's apartment. I was very pleased with the cleanliness, the size of the room, and the spacious bathroom. There was a walk-in shower which I had to pay extra for at the Radisson. The breakfast buffet was beautifully presented and offered hot and cold dishes, fruit, cereal, rolls, breads, juice, pancakes, meats, pastries, and more. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The tram and train are nearby, so getting around the city is easy. (There is an underground parking garage if you have a car.) The location is not in a bad area. As one reviewer said, the area is getting better each month as buildings are being renovated. There are many young families in the area. You will see moms and dads pushing strollers or carrying their small children on the backs of their bicycles. I would choose the Holiday Inn over the Radisson because it offers the same amenities for a lot less money. For travelers like me who are sightseeing all day and use the hotel just for sleeping, a shower, and breakfast, it is perfect.

<Content>Nice hotel, worth the money I spent five nights at the Holiday Inn City Centre East and was quite satisfied. What I liked:My room was clean and spacious, the bath was even huge. Staff was efficient and friendly. The free WLAN in the lobby is a nice touch that I appreciated a lot. When I made the reservation online I requested a quiet room on a high floor. I called the hotel in the afternoon on the day of arrival and was told that a suitable room had already been pre-blocked. So I got what I wanted despite my late arrival. The room was overlooking the courtyard which means no great view but also no noise from the street.I didn't have breakfast at the hotel, so I can't comment on that.What I didn't like:The treadmill in the mini-gym was broken.The connecting door to the adjacent room wasn't soundproof at all. I could almost understand what people in the other room were talking about.A few words about the location: While still in the City (Prenzlauer Berg area) the hotel is not very centrally located, but it's definitely not in a bad area!Prenzlauer Berg is traditional residential area. Some buildings are still quite run down due to neglect under the former communist rule, but more and more buildings are being renovated, so it's becoming nicer month by month.It's a few minutes by tram (Strassenbahn) to Alexanderplatz and the tram stops right in front of the hotel. The nearest S-Bahn station (Prenzlauer Allee) is about 5 minutes from the hotel.

<Content>Good rooms... The hotel was within our budget and we were pleasantly surprised to find a nice contemporary, clean, and spacious room. It was fairly easy to get to from the main train station in Berlin, but it does entail using the local subway/train system. Be careful if traveling with little kids as the TV allows you to view clips of pay-per-view channels which may not be suitable for children. Instruct the concierge ahead of time to block out these channels so you do not encounter this problem.

<Content>bad location, bad service The hotel is far from the city centre in a not to good neighborhood. The restaurant is just a few tables in the lobby and the bar is the end of the front-desk counter. The staff is very unfriendly and even rude. When you stay in Berlin better stay in hotel that offers more value for money. The Crown Plaza is a good alternitive.
