<Content>Great Hotel reviews are old After viewing these reviews I decided to take a chance. Boy were you all wrong. This is a great hotel. I happened to check in during a manager reception. You do not find this at other Hampton Inns. The room was nice and clean at a great price. The area is starting to show some improvement and this hotel seems to lead the way.

<Content>Area's gone downhill This is my third stay at this hotel over a period of several years. Although the hotel itself is still above average, I was extremely surprised to see that the area around the hotel has diminished in character - not to be too blunt, I would not consider walking out of the hotel after dark. It is unfortunate that this has happened, but even though the hotel is very comfortable, I don't think I would stay there again because of the neighborhood.

<Content>nice hotel, felt safe We found the positive comments about this hotel spot on. The hotel is located halfway between the downtown/airport and U. Phoenix stadium. 11 miles to everything - no trouble getting a cab. Even though the hotel was full and very busy, staff was extremely helpful, rooms and breakfast were at highest level for a Hampton Inn. We were able to check in at 10am with no questions asked.The location is right off the highway, with several other similar chain hotels nearby. Although there is nothing charming to recommend the area, we walked around a little and didn't see anything to suggest that it would be unsafe. Our view is not typical, though, because we were there for the Super Bowl and the adjacent hotel was HQ for the auxiliary state troopers brought in for the event.

<Content>Nice hotel in a bad area I stayed at this hotel in August, 2007 with some international travelers. The hotel is in a rough part of town. Without getting into details, after hours there are things going on around the hotel that you would expect from a seedy area.Amazingly, all of that stopped at the driveway of the hotel. I don't know how they did it, but I never felt unsafe on the property. Staff was excellent and was very helpful getting my associates to the airport after my early departure. I would probably stay here again on business but not with my wife and kids.

<Content>Great Stay June 2007 found us staying at this Hampton Inn in Phoenix on Latham. We were attending a conference and read the reviews on-line about this property. It was a perfect location for us.The property grounds are beautifully maintained. The front desk staff professional and friendly.The rooms are typical of a Hampton Inn - maybe a wee bit nicer. They were clean, new linens, quiet (even close to the freeway), friendly housekeeping staff too.The area is not the reason we stayed but the convenience to I-10. I saw the negative comments about the location but they were not a factor in our decision to chose this location. Also, there are multiple places to dine fairly close and that also was not a problem.I would recommend this location and stay here again. Enjoy!

<Content>We Loved This Hotel - Highly Recommend it! My husband and I just cspent a great vacation in Sedona Arizona and are headed back to Los Angeles. We wanted to take our time driving back and spend a night in Phoenix with easy access to the I-10. I am thrilled that we decided to stay at the Hampton Inn. I really expected to be disappointed after our stay at a Sedona Resort but this place is lovely. The room with 2 queen beds is very large, the beds are extremely comfortable, the internet access is perfect, the bathroom and room appointments are lovely, and they even offer HBO and pay per view movies. Best of all, it is extremely clean. I'm a fanatic about that and with all the talk about hotels with bedbugs I even check the mattresses. This passed inspection with flying colors. And, oh, the staff is friendly and helpful.

<Content>Good Hotel - not best location I have stayed at this Hampton Inn many times. I have never had any problems, each stay has been a pleasurable experience. There are 5 or 6 hotels near this area, this is the beginning of Phoenix as you come in from the west. It is convenient for me as I have business contacts nearby, close and simple.The facility is modern and clean. This last stay I noticed they had new bedding comforters and pillows, much better than before. Out of all the hotels on the west side near i-10, this one is probably the best. The facility is secure,  the staff is professional. I think they must have upgraded the wifi internet connection also. I have stayed in all parts of this hotel and never had such a strong connection as I did this last stay.The complimentary hot breakfast is similar to most other Hampton Inns I've stayed at. Eggs, a meat, cereal, breads and fruit.I agree with others that it's not the best area, but it's not the worst either. There is not much nearby except a 24 IHOP. I have walked there at night, but I am a big male and I dont recommend walking out at night for for everyone. Over all I like the Hampton Inn I-10 west and recommend it to others staying in that part of town.

<Content>Watch out Watch out for the cancellation policy at this Hampton Inn and the attitude of the management. They have a 24 hour cancellation policy unlike essentially other Hampton Inns which have a 6 pm policy.

<Content>Great place to stay, but pricey My husband and I stayed at the Hampton Inn for one night (April 9, 2005). We were upgraded to an executive room without asking. It was a lovely room--immaculate, tastefully decorated, with microwave/mini-refrigerator. The bed was very comfortable, but the pillows were flimsy. The bathroom had lots of counter space. The breakfast buffet included a couple of hot items. (That morning it was egg patties and biscuits and gravy.) We have no complaints about the Hampton Inn; we just felt that it was overpriced. We paid $120 for what was supposed to be a standard room. That was by far the highest rate we paid in all of Arizona, from Tucson to Flagstaff.
