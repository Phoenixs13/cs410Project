<Content>Good Small Hotel Parador El Buen Caf茅 is in a convenient but definitely non-scenic location. It is directly on busy Route 2 across from Sam鈥檚 Club, and is adjacent to a neighborhood of small houses. There is a building across a small side street from the parador which houses the El Buen Cafe restaurant and a cafeteria. We found the staff at this parador to be extremely friendly. They provided us with all the information we asked for about the hotel and about the local area, and gave us towels to use at a nearby beach as well as some free (rum) drink coupons. The hotel room was of adequate size and very clean; the a/c worked well and the beds were comfortable. Room furnishings were adequate but not particularly up-to-date. There is a small pool on the side of the hotel and there is a distant view of the ocean from the windows in the back of the hotel. Dinner at the El Buen Caf茅 restaurant was quite good although the service seemed slow, especially considering that there were very few customers. Breakfast at the El Buen Caf茅 cafeteria was not as good. The morning we were there, the selection was limited, the food quality not very good, and no prices were posted. The price we were charged for a basic scrambled-egg breakfast seemed excessive.

<Content>Been twice will go again We found this place by chance in '03 and went back in '07. The rooms are immaculately clean. The staff is courteous and helpful. The Cafe across the street is a real taste of PR and the restaurant is an upscale version. The pool looks nice, tho I haven't had time to go into it. Will gladly stay there again if I am in PR again.

<Content>Absolutely great! Very, very friendly staff. They always smile and say hello. I didn't have to ask anything. They gave all the information I needed. Comfortable rooms. Incredibly clean. Nice view. Very comfortable beds. Space for all your luggage. Small refrigerator. Bathrooms are very clean, with everything you may need, even a small hair dryer. Food at the cafereria is great, and the service, excelent and fast. The pool is good for the whole family. You have everything near: beach, shopping mall, gas station, etc.

<Content>No complaints This was a fine stop-over stay on our way from the San Juan airport to the southwestern part of the island. We stayed for one night. The room was spacious, clean, and quiet, and appropriately priced. The staff was pleasant enough and gave us directions when we checked out.The hotel is located less than a mile away from a nice beach that is frequented by families and locals. We didn't eat at the cafe across the street, or hang around Hatillo long enough to get a feel for the town. Overall, though, the hotel was a comfortable place to stay for one night. One note: we didn't actually see an elevator in the hotel. I would advise anyone who needs handicap accommodations (or who has a lot of heavy luggage) to check with the front desk before booking.

<Content>Great Staff but limited pool hours The staff was great, but they have limited hours for their pool used. As a traveler you are going to spend most of the day moving around and will hope for a place to unwind on the evenings. The Parador itself was very nice but they close the pool at 6PM so if you want to relax by the pool after a long day of sighseeing this is not the place for you. But in the other hand if you want a friendly and helpfull staff then this is the place for you.

<Content>Nothing fancy, but good Overall, the Buen Cafe is a simple hotel that is a good place to spend a night or two if you are looking for a place near the Rio Camuy Caves and the Arecibo Observatory. The hotel is right off the highway, which makes it easy to find, but also means that it is not in a scenic location. But there is a beautiful small beach just a couple of minutes (driving) away that the hotel staff can direct you to. The rooms are nothing fancy, but they are clean and have good beds. The hotel is fairly small, so there are not many services available. There is diner-like restaurant across the street that is affiliated with the hotel. The food was fine, but nothing to get excited about. The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful.

<Content>Nice Place Talk about service - this place was amazing.We got to Hatillo around 6:30 PM, and we were given our room. We were handed our remote (apparently people walk away with the remote controls to the TVs) and were told not to use to towels to clean cars, polish shoes or color our hair (apparently that's all been done there!). We were given directions and times to the cafe that opens really early and the restaurant along with two free drink coupons. The room was big and clean. The shower had good water pressure. The room was on the first floor. That's when the BOOM BOOM sounds started. The wedding party in the meeting room in the basement shook our rooms. So right after we took a shower we asked for a change of rooms since the party was to go till midnight as per the front desk.The lady at the front desk apoligized and took us to the other wing of the parador across the road (that's where the cafe and the restaurant are). This room was slightly smaller (and cheaper - I got a refund) but seemed to be newer construction. This room was clean too... and quiet. The beds were comfortable and except for the loading dock noises early the next morning, we had a rested stay.The restaurant on the first floor -the food is good... our wait staff was a bit stand offish - seemed like they were going thru the chores. They had a singer crooning Spanish songs (sounded like my Julio Iglesias CDs I love to listen but don't understand!)Checkout was a breeze. The staff helped us with tips to get to the Caverns and Arecibo.The bad side: There seems to be a lot of locks and iron grills on the outer doors which gave me the impression that it's probably a high theft area. We however did not encounter or hear anything

<Content>Very nice place The room was very nice, the staff helpful, and the food at the diner was really great! We stayed two nights, the first was very quiet, the second night (a Saturday) it was terribly noisy, (it was noise in the neighborhood, not in the building. ) Parking was also difficult on Saturday due to the fact there was a wedding reception there. Overall, a very nice time though. I would definitely stay there again.
