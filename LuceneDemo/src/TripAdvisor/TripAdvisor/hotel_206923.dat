<Content>Nice staff The hotel is easy to find. It is on a very busy street. There are rooms that face the back. Back rooms are smaller. Bath is huge and clean. Beds are comfortable. The staff is so nice. Very helpful and friendly from front desk to maids.The hotel like many in Barcelona exist above the metro. At quiet times, one can hear the trains roll under the hotel. This happens in better hotels too. A very good tapa bar is 100 meters from the the hotel: turn right toward the train stop it is right on the corner. A bit pricey, but very tasty. Tapas of all sort in the window. Look for this. Breakfast is very adequate. Hot and warm selections. The hotel is three stops from Catalunya. It is nice to be away from the La Ramlas maddness and come to the room. The hotel is not too bad and not the best, but adequate for the budget traveler. The NH hotel chain has many different levels and this fits the bill for a budget one. Enjoy!

<Content>ok I know better NH Hotels..The rooms are quite big, the staff is really friendly, breakfast is nice. But if you look closer, you will notice that the hotel really needs to be renewed: the walls are quite dirty, everything is quite old..

<Content>Halfhearted attempt to be a better hotel After having heard good things about and seen many good looking nh hotels, this was our first stay at an nh:The impression from the website was that the rate was 80 鈧? at 5 nights you would think that to be 400 鈧? What Barcelona Hotels seem to do is to catch you with a low first night rate and then raise the rate indiscriminately. Not very nice. A rip-off that should not be tolerated by the hotel websites.The location is away from the tourist masses and what a relief this is, certainly during busy periods. However, the selection of restaurants in this area is not large and all allow smoking. The Condor staff could only recommend one, the Cormiols, which also turned out to have prices about 2 to 3 times as high as other restaurants in the area.This hotel is a rehab and it has some features that would be considered building code violations in the US and other countries in continental Europe. Also, the soundproofing is terrible and we had a screaming child in the next room for several nights. It frequently smelled as though someone was smoking in our bathroom and this spread through our bedroom. The smoke was apparently entering through the exhaust. Pretty awful for non-smokers and we had enough of smoking throughout Barcelona. Even Restaurants advertised as no smoking establishments allowed smoking.Some of the desk staff seemed disinterested. The housekeeping was generally good, the room and bathroom were well cleaned.

<Content>Troubled times amplified During a very difficult time when my father required heart surgury we were placed in two different NH group hotels, the first being the Belagua where the staff were very sympathetic. Unfortunatley, as this group of hotels do not know their availability on a daily basis until late afternoon/early evening we had the misfortune to be moved to their sister hotel NH Condor where the staff lacked tremendously in customer care, one in particular was the tall slim male desk clerk. If you want to sleep and go its ok but if you want that little extra that makes your stay special this is not the hotel.
