<Content>The Staff make this place A hotel at a shopping mall? It sounds like my idea of pure hell, but no! The staff are SO helpful and friendly that you soon realise that actually the location enhances the experience. Dolphin Mall has some decent eateries, and the pitchers of Mojito at Mojitos are a welcome worth waiting for after a 10 hour flight, 1.5 hour immegration queue and 1 hour wait for a rental car (don't book with Dollar!). As for the hotel itself, well - the rooms are a decent size, the bed is comfy, the little kiosk shop at the reception is good for all those little items you need like snacks, beverages and beer etc., the pool looked compact but good enough for a refresher - if you have the time between shopping and eating - and the best bit . . you don't have to travel into the over rated and egotistical hole that is South Beach to start your vacation! A great place for that pre-vacation shopping time . .

<Content>Not what I expected but just right I booked this hotel over the internet having looked at the location and the reviews on this site and checking the price, deciding it was the best place for exploring Miami and for what I wanted out of a holiday - sun, shopping and relaxation. On arrival, I wasn't sure I had got the right place - you have to appreciate that the hotel is literally in the middle of a mall car park and I mean literally. The Dolphin Mall is 500 yards away and 500 yards in the other direction is NW12th street and 1500 yards above you is the flight path for Miami International. My heart sank as I drove up but determined to be positive, I unloaded my case and went to check in. There my positivity was rewarded. The front desk staff were excellent, the room was big and airy with double glazing blocking out the majority of noise. The restaurant for breakfast was great and inexpensive (too few staff at times compared to the number of visitos but the ones who are there every day are superb). Any questions about the hotel, Miami or Florida were answered by the front desk staff with local knowledge which helped greatly (e.g. don't go to Disneyland on Thanksgiving unless you don't want to go on any rides!). The gym room is small and solely for cardio but this is meant to be a holiday not a permanent workout. The pool is ideal and a real suntrap (Igot a better tan here than down at the beach) if you don't mind the background traffic noise. As a base for the area, it was perfect. The Florida Turnpike is just down the road for trips to Orlando, the Dolphins Stadium, the Everglades and the Keys. The Dolphin Expressway is the other direction for trips to the city, the other malls, the American Airlines stadium and Miami Beach. As one of my aims for the holiday was shopping, the Dolphin Mall was one of the top two malls I visited and it was right across the car park-ideal!My main tip is don't let your first impression ruin your idea of this hotel - unusual location yes but ideal base definitely.

<Content>Loved the Little Courtyard next to the Mall I recentley stayed at this Hotel because my Company recommended it. After a red-eye flight from the west coast I was just so happy to reach my destination. I got to the Hotel early and received a very warm welcome. I was just going to ask if I could store my luggage till later and go to work and the girls at the front desk gave me an early check-in. I am so used to check-in time is 3pm, It was a nice surprise. Got upstairs to my room and it looked great, smelled new and was super clean. I took a shower in their beautiful bathroom and headed to work. When I returned I asked where I should go for dinner. They gave me a list of Restaurants and an Italian place that delivers right to your Hotel room(used them later in the week). The Sales Manager / Director was there and she was so sweet. She went to her office and came back with a discount booklet full of deals for the Dolphin Mall. They were all so great. The breakfast servers were SUPER. The High Speed Internet was good and FREE. You really feel welcomed at this Hotel and that is great being away from home. I can't wait to return! The only thing that I didn't like is there is not a shuttle to and from the Airport. The taxi was $30.00 each way.

<Content>Very good We stayed 2 nights in the Courtyard Marriott Dolphin Mall, booked through hotel's own website. Main purpose of the stay was to have a decent place to sleep and relax between flights - no needs for entertainment, pool, restaurant services, etc. but definitely for clean, secure, quiet, comfortable room. This hotel met our expectations very well.As the entire hotel is non-smoking, this was a big plus for us. Our room had 2 queen beds, very comfortable, selection of pillows ready in the room. Plenty of closet space, desk for working, small living area with chairs and table, one corner equipped with coffee making facilities. Bathroom had shower and bathtub combination. The room had a balcony overlooking to the Dolphin Mall / parking area, parking in front of the hotel was free.Everything in the room and in the hotel was clean and well maintained. Complimentary wireless internet connection in the room was good and worked without problems. Self-service laundry and dryer were available: 1$ per use, worked perfectly. Breakfast buffet in the lobby restaurant offered good variety of items, fresh and nicely presented. However, as noted by previous reviewer, there was wide gap between the skills of the egg station ladies: first day was just perfect with great service, second day was only fair with minimum service. Breakfast was not included into the room rate, but was reasonably priced. Service in the hotel/reception was very good. Our luggage did not arrive with us and the hotel provided dental kit, deodorant and razor kit - immediately and free of charge. During our stay all our questions were promptly responded and all the staff were polite with us. What should be noted is that there is no fridge or microwave nor safe in the room. However, safety deposit box is provided in the reception (free of charge), and it is easy to access any time. However, only a couple of boxes are big enough for laptop computers. If you need a room in quiet location, request it - noise from the hallway comes through the door.

<Content>good enough Convient hotel, Courtyard standards but Undertrained staff.Few teething problems, like no dressing mirror -can you believe that.The only mirror is in the bathroom above the sink.the toilet didn't flush properly. the B/fast too pricy and the omlette lady is not on top of things. Must mention 2 front desk staff. Denise and a lady from PR. Very warm and welcoming ladies. When the shift changed the other ladies were not very helpful.All in all i will stay again.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great staff  This was the second time I've stayed in this hotel in a month and both times were fantastic. The hotel is very clean, the rooms are very nicely decorated with really comfy beds, flat screen TVs, and good quality sheets and towels. Very good value for money.The staff were super friendly and couldn't do more to help - especially the waiting staff at breakfast, and at check-in.I chose this hotel for it's proximity to the airport and for it's location at the Dolphin Mall as I was only in the States for one night. A taxi from the airport will cost you just under $30 but I found a taxi willing to take me to the airport for a flat rate of $20. There's also a return shuttle bus between the airport and mall which is $10 for a return ticket, but it only goes every couple of hours.Will definately be staying here in future!

<Content>Great Place to Stay A lot of my travel takes me to Miami. I've stayed in a lot of places in the past several years. This Courtyard has a great location (a few minutes from all major expressways); close to the airport (10-15 minutes); great shopping (next to a huge Mall); and best of all - it is brand new. The staff will give you an available room where you want (just ask them) and they cater to your every need. I caught one of my kids getting directions to the zoo from the desk staff (by the way, it is 15 minutes away). There were always newspapers (at your door in the morning, too), coffee and internet access (in your room free, too) in the lobby. Will stay there again (and again)

<Content>Nice hotel, Great service I would not normally even think of writing a review, but this place was by far the nicest hotel I have stayed at in the Miami area. Usually I have not been impressed by the customer service down in the South Florida area, but these folks treated me and my 2 co-workers like royalty. The staff helped us without our asking, were polite, courtious and friendly. The hotel is new and modern, extreemely clean, and surrounded by great shops and places to eat. They have earned my business again anytime I am in the area.
