<Content>Beware!!!! By trpt_man, 09/20/08 In my opinion this is a really expensive place that's not worth the call. Rooms are small, dirty and smelly. I booked the night before I got there Once there I saw the rooms bad condition I turned around and told the front clerk I was leaving. I asked if there were any penalties or charges for the cancellation and the attendant said no. They still charged the room. The next month I called and asked to speak to the manager and when I started asking her about the charge she passed the telephone and I heard her say Oh, you deal with him when I asked who I was speaking to she said she was a former employee and she remembered me. After about 10 minutes of trying to reason with her, I asked to speak to the manager and she did not want to take the call, I could hear her in the background. Then I was rudely told to call my bank and she just hung up

<Content>try this hotel in a year or two or three This is a beautiful old brick building with lots of possibilities. But currently, avoid staying here if you can. The room was in pretty sad shape--even had a broken box frame on the bed.  NO HOT WATER!!! Not even after several calls. They still charged full price. Thread-bare towels. No food service but they did have a charming diningroom. Couldn't get into the wireless internet. Best part was that it was very clean.

<Content>Worst Place Ever!!! This place is really bad. dirty, noisy, smelly, bug infested (roaches and mosquitos) The service was really poor We had a terrible experience there. We didnt even got our money back because of the policy of the hotel. They stole our money and didnt care for our bad experience there. the girl that check us in tried talking to the owner about our money but he said that id we already paid, that was out problem.... Health and fire department should close this place down... HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND PLACE. HORRIBBLLLEE!!!!

<Content>This was the worst place to stay in Puerto Rico. This was the worst hotel I have ever been to. We arrived at about 6pm . And was told we had to take our own luggage to the second floor because the bellhopper had left for the day. We were also told we were to have complimentary dinner. To which the cook had also left early because he was tired. Upon dragging our luggage to the second floor with the key room and remote for the TV in hand . THe room was hidious. There as only about 5 channels to view. There was creepy looking guys roaming the halls. And upon parking the car there was people having intercourse in the parking lot. We remain a max. stay of 10 minutes, We were told to speak to the manager the following day. She was unable to resolve any problems. Do not be fooled by this stay. You have a better chance staying on the town next to it on the road 100 THE LIGHT HOUSE. THis was a fantastic place to stay.

<Content>the worst motel on Earth!!!! I stayed in the dusty, filthy ,dirty, horrendous place due that I was looking for a place in San German, PR. First, The parking is in a lot one block away very dark w/o illumination. There is no elevators. I had to carry my luggage to the second floors by the stairs without help. The room, What a room. The carpet has not been clean since the open this motel in more than 40 yrs, is so dirty that you have to use your shoes all the time. Beds are raggidy and the mattress is old and out of shape. When I went to the bathroom is so dirty the shower that I preferred to skip a bath that night. And they had the odyssey of charging 80 dollars a night for a place that not even pigs would stay. After a horrible scary night (By the way the door has the lock broken), I left the hotel in the morning and requestes to have my second night credit to my credit card, which they refused. I assumed they charge in advanced to catch a bunch of fools like me. I told that I hope with the money of the second night they could make some repairs.I called the Mayaguez Holiday INN instead, They were happy to welcome me after this trauma and the HOLIDAY INN is a Five star hotel compared with the pigstay of OASIS. Thanks Hoilday INN.!M.Ruiz from LA

<Content>The worst place in the island! This place is a chiquero (a dump). The room was dark. The A/C unit didn't work, in fact it leaked onto the carpet. WE HAD TO BUY A FAN to circulate the little cold air the a/c provided!! There's only 1 cook for everyone. which meant 1 hour waiting time for your food! (fun guy though, the cook; he's the only good thing about the place)You never see the manager, only some girl who can only say I'm sorry ma'am! The pool!! LORD!!!! No chance I was getting in there!! The water was GREEN and it had nothing to do with the tiles underneath!The furniture looked like it had been salvaged from a flood years ago!The room smelled like it hadn't been opened in years!OHH!! And there's no parking!!! Only some pebbled lot with no lines! You have to leave your car's plate number in case someone blocks you or you're blocking them!!!Let me tell you, I don't drink, but after 2 hours in that place, I was ready to drink my sorrows away!They refused to give back my money... (they say no refunds when you call and reserve!! They're not dumb!)They should shut down the place!! It's also infested with pigeons... there were pigeon feathers all around the pool and in the water! YUCK!!In short.... DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT STAYING THERE!!! You're better off sleeping in your car!(I don't have fotos because I haven't developed them yet! But I will!! I took pictures!)

<Content>No Way! This place is really bad. Very dark, ALOT of mosquitos and rooms looked un touched for weeks. Made a reservation but when we arrived, we could not stay there. So we tried to get a refund but the hotel refused. They gave us a credit for our NEXT visit.....yea right. Stay in La Parguera. Really good service.
