<Content>German Bonhomie at the Greifswald! We, a party of four 40-year-old blokes, recently spent 2 nights here and although we spent very little time in it, I am doing my TripAdvisor duty!. The hotel is located on a main road heading north-east from Alexanderplatz (the M4 tram will get you there in about 10 minutes) but as it is set well back from the street, the hotel itself is very quiet. It is built around a small courtyard which I'm sure is very pleasant to breakfast in during warmer weather.The reception/breakfast area has a certain rock music vibe to it as the hotel appears to cater for a lot of passing musicians playing the nearby Magnet or Knaack clubs. During our stay, reception staff were super-friendly and gave us Berlin virgins plenty of advice! I have to say that this friendliness extended to all of the locals we came across in the east of the city (I've never met nicer people on my travels).Both rooms were perfectly sized, pleasant ,and clean, with good bathrooms. Breakfast is an extra 7.50 euros but well worth it , and it is served until midday (a real bonus given that Berlin bars don't seem to close!).Based on our albeit quick Berlin taster, I would say that the old east Berlin is more happening if your holidays are more about bar-hopping and is the part of town I'll be heading back to in the not so distant future and I would happily return to the Greifswald.

<Content>Incredible value for money This hotel doesn't look very promising from the outside. You have to walk into the second of three courtyards to reach the (small) entrance.But once inside, you are welcomed by a most pleasant and friendly staff. My boyfriend and I felt like V.I.P almost. We could always ask for information and if they didn't know the answer, they would always do an extra effort to find it.The hotel is not fancy in any way, rather low-key in fact, but it's a small gem for the undemanding traveller and quite a surprise even for the more demanding one.The room was not huge, but big enough, with a roomy cupboard, comfortable beds and a clean and fresh bathroom. Since the hotel lies away from the street, it's very quiet and no problems to get a good night sleep.And the breakfast was INCREDIBLE!! We loved everything that was presented at the buff茅 in the morning. That this kind of excellent service is included in the price of the room is nothing short of amazing.There is only one downside to this place and it is the lack of an elevator. Our room was on the 5th floor and walking all the way up there on the quite narrow stairs was something of a chore at certain times. However, if you are reasonably fit it shouldn't be something that should stop you from staying at this truly charming and wonderful little hotel.

<Content>Nice budget choice in colorful neighborhood Great budget choice in a great location - stayed several nights and enjoyed it greatly. Don't be scared off by the bizarre walk to the lobby - there's a charming hotel inside, with wonderful, friendly staff (although the overnight crew less so) and a monster breakfast buffet. On a block with transit options to get you to other parts of Berlin. Highly recommended.You have to walk a few blocks to find a good bar or sitdown restaurant, but it's a safe neighborhood and full of hidden surprises. And the staff was friendly, but not overly knowledgeable about nightlife. But that is what the Internet is for. Speaking of which, they have free wireless, but it is spotty on certain floors. Overall, you get a lot for your money here, and it has character you can't get at a big expensive hotel.

<Content>This place is a gem! If you read the Lonely Planet desciption of Hotel Greifswald one does not get the impression that the place is anthing special, which should just goes to show how subjective our experiences can be! In contrast, I was very much impressed by this gem of a hotel. There has been much fanfare in other reviews about the lavish breakfast spread, late check-out time and the cheery staff, which I would also happily second. However, the rooms are also worth a mention - I found them stylishly, albeit simply decorated, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The hotel's location is also a definite plus. Why break the bank looking for a place to stay in Berlin Mitte when hotels in this part of town (Prenzlauer Berg) can be reached from Alexanderplatz in a five minute tram ride or fifteen minute walk? In fact, I liked this place so much I am coming back for Easter with the love of my life!

<Content>Very friendly staff, fantastic freshly made breakfasts, cakes galore Very friendly staff who man the hotel 24x7, fantastic freshly made breakfasts officially available until 12:30pm but I still had eggs and bacon made for me at 2pm. Was also offered home made cakes on topof everything else.Rooms simple but clean. Shower temperature a bit tricky to master. No lift.M4 Tram just outside to take you to Alexander Platz and Hackescher Markt (about 10mins). Taxi from Tegel Airport about 22 euros.Overall, a very enjoyable stay.

<Content>A pleasant stay My boyfriend and I booked Hotel Greifswald based on Trip Advisor reviews; it is also mentioned in the new Time Out Berlin guide. We were very happy with our stay. Very prompt e-mail replies from Neil when we booked . 24 hour check in for our 2 am arrival. Lovely mellow Miguel at the desk in the evening. Spacious, light and airy high ceilinged room with two tall windows; bathroom with shower only; budget furniture but tasteful; lovely Ikeaish curtains. Cost was 75 euros per night. - I think it was probably one of the hotel's nicer rooms and looking out over the entrance court it saved us from building site noise to the rear. We had an epic night at the grungey Magnet Club which is next door to the hotel. Dancing til dawn and then a quick stumble to bed. There are many cheap and cheerful Imbiss hangouts on ungorgeous Greifwaldstrasse; we bought 1 euro beers from a shop and had a start the evening drink in the hotel garden- really a parkling area but fine on a hot night. Due to extreme oversleeping we missed the hotel breakfast but didn't starve as there are many cafes in the area. The walk over to beautiful Kollwitzplatz will reveal many cute places.

<Content>My sanctuary in Berlin My partner and I booked some flights to Berlin and decided that we would search for a hotel a couple of weeks before we jetted off. I did some searches and everyone told me to stay in West Berlin. Looking at the sites and reading about Berlin, the East has more to appeal. I found this charming hotel and due to the reviews on tripadvisor, I emailed them straight away. I booked via email and the people were very helpful and informative. When we landed, they gave me directions to get there on the train and tram, these took us to the front door. We arrived slap bang in the middle of breakfast and although we should not be checking in until after 12, they sat us down and made us feel very welcome immediately.The hotel is as I had imagined it, full of character. There are some amazing little restaurants and bistros up side streets and the food and booze is remarkably cheap! After the most amazing breakfast I could have dreamed off (eggs, bacon, cheese, ham, cereal, toast, you name I ate it, fresh fruit the works!!!!!) we set off. Due to the immense breakfast, no lunch was needed, just some fruit from the several 100 stand around the city. When we returned late at nigh, we could grab a couple of beers from the off licence round the corner and enjoy them sat in the peaceful courtyard. As we were out early and in late (with a quick stop off in the afternoon) the hotel is a stone throws away from the city centre, a couple of stops on the tram. The trams are so regular that there is no need to worry about anything. The city is extremely relaxed and the hotel reflects this. We are going back this year-it is my little paradise a facinating city.

<Content>Very good breakfast, near a tram stop. I booked a room in the Hotel Greifswald because of the comments on this site about the breakfast. It kept me going all morning as I walked around the city. They give you a choice of teas too! The hotel isn't like the modern NH type places but it is in an older building with character. I like to use public transport and the M4 tram stops a few metres from the entrance. The M4 line takes you to Alexanderplatz in a few minutes.Communication via e-mail in English was quick and they put me on the ground floor when I wrote to tell them I had a sprained ankle. I'm not sure if they have a lift because my room was an apartment 10 metres from the hotel entrance. It had a kitchen area where I could eat a takeaway meal. The heating in December worked fine and the bed was comfortable (I'm 1.92 tall).If I win the lottery this Christmas I will stay at the Adlon Hotel next time. However, if I don't get lucky I'll be happy to go back to the Hotel Greifswald.

<Content>Would definitely stay here again Four of us stayed here and we all loved it. Very well located for both sightseeing and nightlife. Clean, comfortable rooms and the most fantastic breakfast. Very friendly staff. No lift.The only down side was that our room was at the back overlooking a noisy factory so during the week we were woken very early but at the weekend it was fine.

<Content>Gorgeous and very comfy It's a really charming place. The hotel is very small, very clean and friendly. The stuff speaks mostly German, but understands a bit of English, too. The rooms are small and clean, very comfortable beds. Clean bathroom. The hotel is gay-friendly.But the best thing is stuff. They are very helpful and friendly. The owner of the hotel, a middle-aged woman, cooks breakfast (which is from 7 to 12 in the morning.) It was the best meal I've had in hotels ever.The hotel is situated in Prenzlauer Berg, Estern part of the sity. It's not very close to U-Bahn/S-Bahn, but not very far either, about 2-3 tram stops.

<Content>Worth it for the Best Breakfast Around! This hotel looked a bit dated from the outside, however once though the doors the hotel itself certainly wasn't.... the staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough to help, orgainising taxis, restaurants etc. The rooms were spotlessly clean and warm even though it was -4 degrees outside you'd never have guessed. But the best bit about the hotel was the breakfast - its fabulous, hams, cheeses, bread, cereals etc etc and if you fancy a long lie in its served until 1pm.There is also a very nice bar about 30m down the road towards Alexanderplatz - a bit odd as it doubles as a launderette, but the prices are very reasonable, good place for a night cap??Would recommend getting the hop on hop off bus for a good tour of the city.

<Content>Lovely hotel Nice big room, warm and cosy. (5 flights of stairs though) Staff very friendly and helpful, amazing breakfast that sets you up for the day. I would definitely stay here again, very good value. Very quiet area, possibly a bit too quiet for me. The market on Saturday in Kowilltzplatz is well worth a wander round.

<Content>Great staff great breakfast Tucked away off the street and only a few meters from the street car stop this hotel may seem a little worn at first glance but the rooms are very clean and quiet. I found the hotel staff very friendly and willng to serve. But what a breakfast!!! Eggs, ham, sauage, smoked sallmon, mediteranean veggies, home made cakes just for starters. The hotel staff says that this is the breakfast you look forward to all day-and they mean it. Located in a neighborhood that is being gentrified-lots of restaurants in walking distance.
