<Content>Clean ! We were very happy to learn that the hotel offered free shuttle service. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable, almost pampering. The service was excellent. Every question we asked was answered right away. We would recommend this hotel to others as well as keep it in mind for future stays ourselves.

<Content>Serviceable, but barely Our stay at the Econolodge on Van Buren was sufficient for what it was, but not for the money I paid. The shuttle service took ages to pick us up at the airport (and it was almost 11pm on a Wednesday, so not a terribly busy time frame). When we arrived at the hotel, we were surprised to see that it was basically a motel. We checked in at the registration area, and then had to schlep our bags across the parking lot and up a flight of stairs to our room - all the rooms have door/street access. The bed was hard, the sheets were thin, the blanket was rough. The cable was barely working - but the important things (cleanliness, the a/c, lights/shower/toilet were all perfectly fine). The breakfast that's served are literally pastries wrapped in plastic wrap and coffee - I definitely wouldn't count on that to feed you.  We went for a walk, only to discover that the neighborhood is incredibly shady - like the trailer park that says 'drug and gun free zone'. This place was good for its location, but that's about it. We absolutely wouldn't stay here again, but it wasn't a surprise. It just wasn't good.

<Content>Misleading information Stayed there for free airport shuttle service, but found out there is a charge for parking that was never mentioned on website. Ended up paying double for reservation.

<Content>Worst hotel stay ever!!! I'm a pretty positive person, and not too high-maintenance or picky. This is the first negative review I've ever posted here, but this hotel in Phoenix was heinous, awful, and horrendous. I'm seriously going to write a letter of complaint to the corporate office. -When we first went into the room, the A/C was off. It was about midnight, at least 100+ inside the room, and all we wanted to do was sleep. Miserable!! -The heavy marble facade on the front of the bathroom vanity had come unglued, and was hanging by a thread of caulk. I had to yank it down and put it on the floor so that it wouldn't fall off on our feet while we standing in front of the sink.-We stayed there three nights, and NOT ONCE did housekeeping clean our room! We ran out of towels, ran out of TOILET PAPER (!!!), and the two tiny trash bins were overflowing. This was after we both called and went in person to the front desk to complain.-We had to get our room cards re-programmed every single day. Every day. -After spending the night, the next day we drove down the street and realized there was a prison a couple of blocks away. The only good thing about that place was that it was cheap and close to the airport.

<Content>Talk about saving money If you want to really save money in Phoenix given the very high prices of hotels in this city, try this local hotel on the west side of the city. The hotel was packed the night we arrived but given our plane did not land until 1am and we did not get to the hotel until 2am, the wait staff was there with our reservation in hand. Luckily we found the hotel which was located in a less than desirable part of the city off a main highway but within easy access. The fellow at the counter was cordial and the room was sufficient even if the pillows were very old and pillow cases dirty. The bed had not been replaced in some time and the tv cable was limited but for a quick inexpesive stopover, it was a good solution.Try this place if you arrive late and just want a hot shower and a place to rest your hat.

<Content>Shady neighborhood -- Never again! I booked this on Travelocity as a cheap place to stay before a 6AM flight. We pulled into the Econo Lodge off of VanBuren St. We thought the neighborhood was bad on our way in... only to find 2 scroungy guys in a fist fight in the parking lot. Never checked in... took the loss of the non refundable charge and stayed somewhere else. Wouldn't have slept a wink there regardless!

<Content>Exactly what we were looking for It's cheap, close to the airport and has high-speed internet. So, I can't complain. If you come from teh airport though, wait for the free shuttle. The cab drivers will rip you off big-time. It's a couple of miles away and we were charged 20$. The shuttle is free and runs every half hour or so. This place also has a free continental breakfast which was nice too. Obviously a cheap place, but relatively clean. But, it was what we were looking for to crash for a night. I'd stay there again.

<Content>Horrible!!!!! 3037 Van Buren Street..........Upon walking into hotel room I found it to be quite simple and appeared neat and clean.However, prior to going to bed, I like to check my bed before I sleep, I found a strand of hairs under the pillow. That grossed me out.....just thinking that the bedding may not have been changed. What I did was took and brushed off with a pillow the hairs.....and went to sleep (I just stayed on one side of the bed (king size bed). Before leaving I decided to strip back all of the bedding and found what appeared to be pubic hair and stains on the sheet as well as the blanket. It was discussting. I even took pictures and called corporate they didn't seem to care.

<Content>Nice hotel at a great price. This Econo Lodge has better than average rooms and an air conditioner that easily keeps up with sweltering Phoenix heat. The reception building is spacious and breakfast is very basic. These are basic but clean accomodations close to downtown but in a slightly seedy neighborhood. If you're looking for inexpensive and don't need any frills then this is your place.

<Content>Never again...Econo Lodge Phoenix on Van Buren Extremely disappointed in this hotel. I guess one gets what they pay for...bugs and all for $40.00/night. One was crawling on the carpet when we walked in, and we later found 3 more on 3 separate towels. Considering Phoenix hit a record high temp of 115 on our arrival date, one would expect the air conditioning would have been turned on prior to our check in as advance reservations were made. We arrived about 9:00 p.m. to a room nearly as hot inside as it was outside. A call to the front desk inquiring about a fan resulted in no fan, but someone from the desk would come to our room to check out the cooling. The response time was prompt, but we were told, It's going to take time to cool off. It is 110 degrees outside. It finally cooled off about 3:00 a.m., and needless to say we never even crawled into the beds, but rather slept on top of the one bed closest to the air. Check-out was quick and smooth...a good thing because we couldn't wait to get out of there. Never again.

<Content>A pleasant surprise I've never stayed at an Econo Lodge before, but this was actually really well. Room was simple, but big and everything worked perfectly. Bed was nice, everything was clean and in working order. Not a lot of frills, but what can you expect for $40.Highly recommended for budget road warriors!Only drawbacks were a shuttle that only runs every hour, and the complimentary breakfast that doesn't start till 7 am on weekday mornings.
