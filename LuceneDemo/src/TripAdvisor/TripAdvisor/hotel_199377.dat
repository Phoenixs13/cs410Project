<Content>Fantastic stay Stayed here for a couple of nights whilst holidaying in Berlin. The room was spacious with good TV channel options and perfect for an early morning flight.The hotel operates three shuttles an hour to the train station and the airport. This is very convenient and worked well after spending a day sightseeing in the city. The train ride to the city is about 25-30 minutes and is quite comfortable.For the price paid, this turned out to be fantastic value. It was just about perfect.

<Content>The right choice before an early morning flight This is the right choice ONLY if you have an early morning choice, otherwise there is no reasons to sleep there for visiting Berlin.The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere, but a free shuttle service connects the train station, the hotel and the airport every 20 minutes.My room was very clean and nicely furnished; the bathroom was quite large and brand new. There was silence during the night and the bed (mattress/duvet) was perfect.I did not have the opportunity to try breakfast, but I looked at the Room Service menu and the selection seems to be quite good.

<Content>Very convenient and comfortable with great beds! We stayed here after arriving on a late flight, and the experience was just so easy and convenient. To catch the free shuttle tot he hotel you just go to the bank of courtesy phones to the right of the main exit, and they will tell you when the next one is due (they are frequent). Then go out of the main exit, turn right and walk a few yards to the shuttle bus stop outside the easyjet office. All the staff I dealt with were all pleasant , helpful and polite. There was a minor hiccup with our rooms when we got there - no sofa bed for our daughter in our room - but that was very quickly and calmly sorted out with no fuss. We had a executive room with a sofa in and they are a good size and very comfortable. The bed was also extremely comfortable, so beware of that velcro pyjama feeling if you have a flight to catch the next morning ! The breakfast buffet is excellent with a really good choice and the service was extremely good. We were then taken again by free shuttle to the station. A really positive experience and a good start to our holiday.

<Content>excellent This is a fairly new hotel but seems to be run seamlessly, with one exception I found the staff extremely helpful and accomodating, the room was very comfortable and very clean, and the little bar was very relaxing, the bar-man was an excellent chap who couldn't do enough for you. Breakfast was excellent and the dining room was bright and cheerful.We would probably have had dinner, but when I went to have a look around upon our arrival, I was met by a young woman who was obviously in the wrong occupation, she was unhelpful and verged upon the contemptuous, needless to say we spent our Euros elsewhere.The hotel was excellent, and the restaurant would not put me off,Just don't have dinner.

<Content>brilliant hotel - well reccomend it! We stayed in this hotel during march of 2008 and loved it. the room was reasonably sized and exceptionally clean. Bathroom was new and spotless with a good hairdryer. The hotel was very well soundproofed and we didnt hear a peep from outside or other guestsThere is a regular and punctual holiday inn bus that picks you up from the station and delivers you to the door of the hotel. It also takes you to the airport in the morning. It runs 24 hours a day and is free. There is a super spa with steam rooms and roof garden at this hotel too which we made full use of and this made our trip even more enjoyable!The bar and restaurant are fabulous and the staff friendly and helpful. While this hotel is situated outside of Berlin, it is within easy reach and absolutely perfect for the airport. Would definately visit again!

<Content>Great for the airport... We stayed here for a short weekend break in Berlin and it's a great hotel.The hotel is pretty much in the middle of nowhere so I wouldn't recommend staying there if you wanted to be close to the city centre. It took us about 40mins on the metro to get into Berlin. For the airport it's great, there's a shuttle every 20mins or so that will take you between the two and also stops off at the metro station.It cost us 拢35 for a double room (without breakfast which cost about 拢8 - there are some places, but not many, at the metro station if you don't want to pay that. Also some places at the airport) which was really good value considering the hotel looked pretty new. My husband said the gym was good and you can even do curling if you fancy it!!The food in the restaurant is fairly expensive, even the bar food would cost you about 拢6 for a salad! We ate in the bar area in the evening and the food was nice. It's also a nice little area to sit and chill in, although a bit drafty!!The staff were great, even changing our feather pillows to hypoallergenic ones due to allergies.Remember you will be on the East Side of Berlin - we didn't realise this at first and got into all kinds of trouble with the metro and underground system!! The metro stations are not great, further out there's no information on when the next one will arrive and you need to look at the front of the train to see where it's going. Further into the city centre the stations get a bit more technologically advanced!All in all, I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Decent hotel, convenient I stayed at the Holiday Inn during a standard touristy weekend. The inclusive shuttle but was regular from the airport [4 times in the hour] and no more than a 10 minute drive away. Staff speak good English and check-in was efficient [well this is Germany]. There is a nice bar and restaurant downstairs which I did not frequent. I had ordered room service which was a good standard and flexible with my vegeterianism. Room was clean and subtly furnished and had a nice view of a small park strip alongside the hotel. Bed was modern and good quality. TV had few English channels which isn't surprising. Bathroom was quite good. Overall good hotel would recommend.

<Content>Good hotel for the Schonefeld airport Stayed in this hotel for the second time, - it is very good if you arrive late at Schonefeld ( future berlin International). Don't bother with the free shuttle if it is not there when you arrive. You will have to wait for up to 30 min for it to arrive, catch a taxi, it is 6-7 minutes drive away and cost 鈧?7.Very good hotel, very good breakfast, friendly. But is is far away from Berlin. Took the shuttle to the train station, from there the U-bahn used 45 minutes to the center og western berlin ( Zoo station).

<Content>Very convenient We stayed here as we had a very early flight out of Berlin. For this kind of situation it is a very convenient hotel. The hotel provides a free shuttle bus to and from the airport and railway station. The room was big enough and was thoroughly clean.We had our two young sons with us and there was both an outdoor play area and an indoor play room available. This was very handy as there isn't really anything to do in the immediate vicinity due to the location near the airport.

<Content>Peaceful This hotel's nice. One of the better Holiday Inns in fact. The main thing is that it is quiet and peaceful, yet a quick ride to the airport. My room was lovely, overlooking a field and the breakfast room was lovely and sunny, although locating all the food took a few goes! Because it's quiet, there's not much nearby. You also need a shuttle (free) to the airport or railway / S-bahn, which is not so good if you stay out late in central Berlin as it's quite a distance.

<Content>Convenience and Quality Driving through the Berlin area and not wanting the bother of trying to drive into the city centre, we decided to find an airport hotel and use their transport. Good strategy. Signage all around the airport made the Holiday Inn easy to find. Parking was free on-street. Shuttle service to the airport train station (5 minutes) made it easy to take the train downstairs. We had a very good evening meal in the hotel and the breakfast was much above average. My wife cut her foot stepping on a luggage strap and the desk supplied what was necessary from a first aid kit. 160 Euros a night for a family of three in one room was about average for Europe. Good experience all the way around.

<Content>well worth staying at A very comfortable hotel with nice facilities such as a sauna  steam room. Rooms were well furnished and very clean.A nice touch is a free shuttle bus from the local airport plus a regular free shuttle bus service to the U Bahn Station nearby.

<Content>Good Hotel After feeling faint after looking at the prices of hotels in the centre of Birmingham I decided to book a couple of nights at the Holiday Inn Schonefeld Airport. There was an initial problem with the courtesy vehicle from the airport being full with a group, but after that everything went smoothly. I was impressed with the hotel which was comfortable and affordable - I slept well both nights I stayed. If you want some exercise it is only ten minutes walk from the Deutsche Bahn station with trains taking 30 minutes to the city centre.I would recommend the hotel if you are flying into Schonefled airport.

<Content>Review of the hotel This was the second hotel in Berlin in which we stayed before going back to Spain (see Agon Frankfurter Allee). We booked a double room and a three-bed room directly with the hotel. Rooms were really good and spacious. They are provided with tea/coffee making facilities and chocolates were left on the pillows. The only problem with the rooms was that in the three-bed one (room number 361) the heating didn't work very good.The location is excellent if you need to be near the airport but not for sightseeing. The hotel operates a 24 hour free minibus between the hotel, the airport and the train station next to it. The bus circles every 20 mins between 8.00am and 10.00pm. Outside these hours you need to ring the hotel. We had dinner at the restaurant and it was not worth it! Food was a little bit expensive and nothing special at all. We had then a problem when paying the dinner with the credit card. The woman of the reception was rude when trying to solve it and finally charged the dinner twice. When we came back to Spain we had to go to the bank to explain what happened as the amount was not given back by the hotel (even though we waited for a month for this refund). We wrote then a letter of complaint to the manager and he apologised for the inconvenience and everything was solved out. Apart from this woman of reception, the staff was friendly.

<Content>Great Between Flights! Stayed here after arriving on a late flight. I couldn't be bothered to head into central Berlin, so had booked this Holiday Inn in advance. I hold a Platinum Card for Holiday Inn Hotels so was immediately upgraded to the best business room they had (having paid the princely sum of 50 Euro - now that's value!). The receptionist was welcoming and promised that a bottle of wine (complimentary) would be sent up to the room. The wine never arrived, but a plate of fruit and cakes did. Still, it was 11pm and I really wasn't in the mood for wine anyway! The room was over-average size for Europe, with a king-size bed, sofa, writing desk and tea/coffee making facilities and minibar. The bathroom was spotless (believe me, I check...if there's one thing I hate it's signs of other peoples' bathroom use....).Holiday Inn provides a shuttle bus from Sch枚nefeld Airport terminal as well as the S-Bahn station in Sch枚nefeld (which is basically in the same area). I took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, because it had been a long day and I weas basically to lazy to wait/contact the hotel. It cost 12 Euro. The bus runs twice an hour if I remember correctly, so no long waits here. The S-Bahn will get you into central Berlin in about 45 minutes - you may have to change trains, depending on which area of the centre you want to go to.All in all, this was a great choice after a late arrival. It was clean, comfprtable and welcoming and aircraft noise was insignificant (I think the airport is closed at night). One slight minus; the public areas are very smoker. As an ex-smoker I tend to find this a bit of a turn off. But that's more to do with German laws and regulations than the hotel itself.

<Content>Great Hotel - handy to aiport We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of October - on arrival in Berlin and again on our last night. The hotel is situated close to the airport and the airport train station. The hotel operates a 24 hour free minibus between the hotel, the airport and the train station (queue at the 'Holiday Inn' bus stops outside). The bus circles every 20 mins between 8.00am and 10.00pm. Outside these hours you need to ring the hotel (the number is on the bus stops). The hotel itself is excellent - very clean and the rooms are spacious. Our first room had an iron/board and bath with shower. Our second room had a shower only with no iron. Both our rooms had tea/coffee making facilities and mini bar. On both occasions chocolates were left on our pillows. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was not included in our rate but we paid separately for this (15.50 euro each). Although not cheap, the breakfast was excellent and set us up for the day (fruit, juices, yoghurts,cheeses, cereals, cold meats, various breads, toast, cooked bacon, eggs, mushrooms). Although quite a way out from the centre of Berlin, the hotel is excellent and a good choice if you have an early or late flight. But as the trains operate so regularly this is also a good and unexpensive base for sightseeing. Berlin transport offer a 'Welcome Card' for around 20 euro (depending on length of stay and area covered) which allows travel on trains/buses and underground for 2 or 3 days. If staying in the Holiday Inn Schoenefeld you will need the Welcome Card which covers zones A,B and C as the Holiday Inn is in zone C.

<Content>Convenient and reliable if using Schoenefeld This is your best choice if you are flying out of Berlin-Schoenefeld early in the morning. As the airport is far from the city center, and you have an early morning flight to catch, you can't do better than this Holiday Inn. There is a free hotel shuttle that would drop you off or pick you up at the Schoenefeld S-Bahn station, which is just a few minutes from the hotel. Rooms are standard Holiday Inn quality, and the overall the hotel provides you with a nice start or end to your holiday. Be mindful that breakfast costs extra, and if you are using public transportation count on at least 20-30 minutes before reaching the center of Berlin.

<Content>superb quality This hotel is top quality at a very good price. The rooms are very clean and modern, the breakfast buffet is superb. I have to say the second time I stayed was more expensive than the first, so maybe little by little the prices are going up.The only drawback I found is that it is not located in Berlin itself. So it is good for catching your plane in the morning, as it is located at the airport itself, but not for going into the city and back to the hotel. Maybe this is the reason the price is good.By the way, these comments refer to my two stays in 2004, so I cannot say how it is now in 2006.

<Content>Great hotel Free shuttle bus, nice touches like complimentary fruit bowl and chocolates. No problems checking in after midnight, very friendly staff. Room was spotlessly clean, good hairdryer, plenty of fluffy towels. Reasonable prices on mini bar. Breakfast buffet amazing with smoked salmon, sparkling wine, oranges and a machine to juice them, omelettes made to order and a huge range of pastries, yogurts, fruit, bread, cheese, meat etc. Excellent value for 12 Euros, Free bus to station the following day for an easy trip into the city (about 1 hour to Ku'damm)

<Content>Believe it or not, I loved it... My wife and I stayed only one night in January 2006 in between flights at Schonefeld, but frankly, it was super clean, the bed was very, very comfy and the coffee machine was decent. It's not a great location if you're going to be doing a lot of touring in the city, but for a one or two night stay, it'll help you get a good night's sleep. Don't bother with the overpriced food.

<Content>Standard Holiday Inn The Holiday Inn Schoenefeld Airport is no more or less than a standard Holiday Inn hotel. The rooms are small and clean. They feature the standard ameneties of a Holiday Inn. The real problem was the service at check-out in the morning when the tiny reception desk was unable to handle all the guests wishing to check out. The public areas, restaurant and bar were standard 3 star quality. I found nothing impressive about the hotel. The location is OK if you are spending an overnight close to the airport but way out of reach of everything in Berlin. That was OK for me since I only stayed there because of a function at the hotel - but I would not recommend it to people visiting Berlin.

<Content>Handy to airport, not to Berlin I stayed one night due to flight timings and found the overall experience to be a good one. One of the best things was that there was a bowl of fruit in my room upon arrival. I don't know if this was because I am a Priority Club member or they do it for everyone, but it made for a nice welcome at the end of a long day working in Berlin. The room was good value (鈧?5/night including breakfast)The hotel has a shuttle which picks up at the airport (I think you have to phone) and also at the s-bahn station nearby. The distance is not walkable unless you really like walking a lot. The hotel is near the airport, but access is via a major road and a long link road.Breakfast in the morning was good with all the usual things like frys, breads, meats, cheeses, etc . . . no complaints there. It took a while to locate the restaurant though because it is through a passageway behind the bar and when I walked into the bar in the morning it was empty and there was no sign of any dining room. I had to check with reception who insisted that the restaurant was at the end of the building before I found it.As other posters have said it is not a place to stay if you want to see Berlin - stay downtown somewhere instead. Getting to downtown Berlin from the hotel would take at least 70-80 minutes depending on timing with the shuttle and train.I would stay there again, but only for flight timing reasons.

I had an excellent evening meal in the hotel restaurant, breakfast provided a good and varied selection. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Good shuttle service to and from the airport.All in all, very good value for money.

<Content>Good Hotel This a really good hotel if you are using the nearby airport. It is very quiet because it sits out by itself in the middle of nowhere.The restauraunt and bar are both very good. Both will be enlarged in the near future. The food is excellent and the staff prompt and courteous. The rooms are clean and bathrooms large. The only down side was the internet connection in our room didn't work so I went WiFi and purchased time from Berlin-Net to check my email. You can purchase time in the business office of the hotel and use your laptop in the lobby/bar area. This was a minor problem.We had a rental car so it was easy to drive in and out of Berlin and we found a bunch of great stores and restaurants going back and forth. The highway system is easy to use. The hotel is a good location if you plan to see the Gardens, River,  Prussian residences in Potsdam. The hotel has it's own parking which they charge to use. I never had a problem finding a place to park either on the side or in front of the hotel. Vehicle traffic is limited so I wasn't worried about leaving the car on the street.The hotel is not close to the city center and if you are a true tourist with a limted sense of direction you might want to stay in Berlin proper.We will stay at this hotel again as it met our needs and exceeded our expectations.

<Content>Ok I guess but only use it if you have to This is the first time I've stopped in an airport hotel and maybe I should expect these things. First of all the good points, it is close to the hotel and it does get you there at any time and also will pick you up from the S bahn station. The rooms are what you would expect from a 4 star hotel.The service at the restautrant is slow and the meals are over priced. The beer prices at the bar are also expensive. When I arrived I was told I had booked a single room (I had booked a double) and then had to hand over 鈧?5 as deposit for the mini bar. In the morning I told them I hadn't used it and got the deposit back- what a waste of time, I could have said anything.We had an early flight so had to stop close to the airport. In future I would look for somewhere else.

<Content>Great Holiday Inn As others have said, this is a great hotel if you are arriving at or departing from Berlin Schoenefeld Airport. It was a great start to our holiday, which took us to Poland and Estonia, and a good finish too, i.e. one night in the Holiday Inn at the beginning and end of our trip. The staff were all very friendly, the rooms a delight, with everything you could want for an overnight stay: hairdryer; coffee maker; mini bar; TV; even tissues in the bathroom, which was very well planned. We liked this hotel a lot, particularly as we got a very good rate, 45 euros a night, though breakfast was an extra 15 euros each per day. The breakfast is excellent, and if the weather is good, you can sit out on the terrace.There is a children's play area with paddling room, and some easy chairs for mum and dad. There is a 'wellness' centre and also a roof garden. The (comp.) shuttle to and from the airport works well - the train station is about 500 m. from the airport terminal, and it costs 2 euro and takes about 45-60 mins. to get to the centre of the city. Thus, if you are out sightseeing all day, and just want to return to a hotel to relax and eat dinner/drink wine, this hotel would suit. But if you want to go out in the city in the evening, look elsewhere. We found it peaceful and relaxing and would not hesitate to use it again.All in all an excellent hotel.

<Content>We wanted to stay here but... The shuttlebus from the airport worked well and the lobby was very nice. Unfortunately that was as far as we got. Despite having had a reservation for 4 months, we were told that there had been a computer error (that seemed to be the story they finally settled on) and they were transferring us to another hotel (The Van der Valk Berliner-Ring - lovely hotel but....) which they assured us was just a few mintues away and also had a shuttlebus which ran to the airport (since our flight wasn't until late afternoon we were planning to spend the morning in central Berlin). In the event the other hotel was more than 20 minutes away and in the middle of nowhere with no public transport links and a shuttlebus could be hired for 15 euros each way to take you to the airport. This effectively scuppered our morning in Berlin.At least five other parties were the victims of the same thing the night we were there. What was infuriating was that the Holiday Inn had clearly known about the problem in advance yet made no effort to advise me of the difficulty before I arrived so that I could make the decision about where I stayed instead of them.So if you're booked in here I suggest you check before you arrive to make sure that you haven't been caught in the same trap.

<Content>Great for Schoenefeld Airport Transfers Stayed there one night in November after arriving at the airport at night and flying out the next morning, booked on line a few days before, got a good rate. It took me a while to find out how to alert them that we were waiting for the transfer bus but the helpful young ladies in yellow caps at Schoenefeld airport pointed out their dedicated 'phone behind the information desk. They spoke English on the 'phone and said the bus was already on its way. It runs every 30 minutes from the Hotel so I'm not sure if they would make a special trip to get you if you had just missed one. As someone else has pointed out it is close to and fantastically convenient for the airport but not so good for Berlin City. We were going to do an early morning dash into Berlin before coming back for the flight but the Airport Express trains tend to run just before the hour and half-hour and their shuttle is on the hour and half hour. As the crow flies its a walkable distance to the station but there might be the railway line in the way, as it was dark I couldn't quite work out if this is possible and safe. The Hotel was very clean, modern and the staff spoke English. They had our on-line booking but offered us an upgrade that we declined; the economy room we had booked was just what we needed for the overnight stay. We had a drink in the bar but didn't use any other facilities or eat there. The transfer back to the airport was fine.

<Content>great place/so-so location for tourists I stayed here for 2 nights in August. I was supposed to stay for 5 nights but I changed hotels after 2 days. It is a very nice hotel but it was too far from the city center. The room I had was large and very clean. The bathroom was big and also very clean. The air conditioning was individually controlled so I was very happy with that. The room service menu was not too expensive and the food was actually very good. The staff was friendly and very helpful. They get a lot of airline employees staying there and they all seemed to know eachother or they were trying to out-do eachother's expertise in being frendly. The only reason I checked out early was because it took an hour to get to Alexanderplatz. That includes waiting for the free shuttle to the train station and then waiting for the train and then taking the train. And that was taking the airport express train. It sometimes took more than an hour depending on the waiting. So, if you want to rest before going out to dinner after a day of sight seeing you end up traveling more than 4 hours in a day. It was too much after 2 days so I checked out. It is great if you want to be near the airport. It is not good if you want to tour Berlin for more than a day.

<Content>Great if you are flying into Schoenefeld I stayed here one night in June 2004 because it is so close to the airport. It was very cheap($95 USD) and very nice. They have a complimentary shuttle to pick you up at the aiport and take you back, no matter how early (we left at 5 am to catch another flight). The food in the restaurant is actually very good as well. We had a great salmon and pasta dish. I probably wouldn't recommend staying here if you are planning on seeing Berlin (we didn't have time), because it seems a bit far out from the city itself. But, great for aiport travelers just passing thru!
