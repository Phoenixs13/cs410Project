<Content>Business class eclectic comfort Like living inside a funky art gallery, but with all the amenities. Pool and gym, internet, bars, restaurants, and it is close to subway and major sites. We stayed for four nights and loved the convenience of the place, both from a business point of view and for proximity to sites/transportation.

<Content>Clean, functional business hotel Stayed just one night so was not able to sample all the hotel had to offer. Checkin staff were friendly and superquick. Room was clean with nice touches - Lindt chocs on pillows (plus a stray one under the pillow) and folded bathrobes on each bed. Toiletries are soso, with two big shower-gel dispensers, one by the washbasin and the other by the bathtub/shower. Shower pressure was good (room was on 9th floor).. you stand in the bath for a shower and draw the shower curtain. Rooms 8th floor upwards are private, however lower floors (on the side I stayed) will face the opposite office building so one would need to draw curtains for privacy. Pool looked good. Got the wake up call I requested at checkin (not something you can take for granted at any hotel). Departed before breakfast time - again checkout was very quick and efficient, and there were plenty of taxis on the stand at 7am. The (very large) bar beside the hotel lobby is lively.. big oval bar in the centre surrounded by soft furnishings. The place easily holds 200 or so guests, and areas can be reserved for groups. People were still being served drinks at 3am on a weeknight. Noise from the bar does not reach the rooms. Security is good with room keys required to activate buttons in the lifts all day long.

<Content>Enjoyed our Stay at the Maritim Pro Arte We stayed at the Maritim Pro Arte in early August 2008. It is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Berlin near a major train and U-bahn station. You can take the S-bahn from the airport right to the hotel. It is a two minute walk from the station to the hotel. Likewise you are one station away from the Hauptbahnhof in Berlin.The staff were courteous and helpful at all times. We loved that you could open the windows in the room. The view outside the windows was spectacular. The breakfast buffet was the best we encountered during our 6 city trip. It was not included in in our room price but it still was worth it. Internet is available; however, you must pay extra. The in-room safe was too small for a laptop computer; however, the hotel has larger safety deposit boxes at reception. Just ask the staff and they will make a box available for you.The hotel is just around the corner from the street Unter den Linden. This street leads you to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag (a 10 minute walk). Make sure you visit the dome at the Reichstag but be prepared for a wait. Also on Unter den Linden is the Opera and its Cafe. The Cafe provides an excellent lunch and supper.Staff at the hotel recommended going to a local restaurant (3 minute walk) called Zur Nolle. Great suggestion and moderately priced. It's right under the train station lines.Take the hop and hop off tour of Berlin. You can catch it around the corner on Unter den Linden. You can purchase tickets form the Concierge. Just be careful to keep your ticket handy if you are checked and be back to your hotel stop before 6 o'clock otherwise you will be dropped off at the nearest stop and then you will have to take the U-bahn back to your hotel.Take a walk on Kurf眉rstendamm Strasse, the 5th Avenue of Berlin and take a tour of Charlottenburg Castle. Take time to visit the Castle's gardens. Next trip we will go the museums in Berlin. We just ran out of time.Maritim Pro Arte is a little pricey but a great place to stay.

<Content>Nice Stay There is really nothing to be worried about seeing where the Maritim Pro Arte is in the League table of Berlin Hotels.It's a two minute walk from Fredrichstrasse station (underground and surburban trains) in what was the old East of the City. Plenty of building work going on, but not a problem.Plenty of shops/small supermarkets/food outlets around. One hotel entrance is on Fredrichstrasse, but the main one is up a side street, Dorotheenstrasse. Most of the accommodation looks out on this and it's really much quieter thanks to the roadblock nearby outside the American Embassy (200 metres away). Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate are an easy ten minute walk away. Reception is what you would expect. Calm, modern, and looks good. Staff are friendly and efficient.We'd booked a Junior Suite and were given a room on the tenth floor. Rooftop view, but you couldn't really see any of the landmarks except if you opened the window and stuck your head out, then you could spot the famous TV Tower.Couldn't fault how the room looked. The only problem was noise (music) coming from the floor below late on the first night The duty manager on reception sorted it out immediately. We found out the problem was the occupant of the Presidential Suite treating it too much like a home from home.We were moved to a (quiet) one bedroom suite on floor nine. Very nice. This had a door between sitting room and bedroom and seemed a little bigger than the junior suite. By the way, anybody in a suite or superior room has access to free food and drink from 0630 to 2200 in the Club Lounge. Couldn't believe more people didn't take advantage of this. Also one free internet terminal in there. Breakfast in the main restaurant seemed expensive at 23 euros each. The free croissants and muffins in the Club Lounge were more than enough. Again very friendly staff.Wellness Centre - pool 12 meters long. Anymore than three people swimming lengths and it would be crowded. Water temperature - cool! Open from 0700-2200, but if you want to use the sauna between 0900 and 1700 you have to give them 30 minutes advance warning. Only three pieces of gym kit (treadmill, cross trainer and one other) but hardly anyone was there, so no probelms.Tip. If coming from Tegal Airport. Look for the 128 bus. Pay driver for ticket and get off at Karl Scumacher Platz. (5 minute journey). You can get the underground direct to Friedrichstrasse from there. Ticket machines at entrance - tickets have to be vaildated. Worth getting a Berlin Welcome card from official Tourist Information points.16.50 euros for 48 hours... 21.50 euros for 72 hours for Greater Berlin area. Again they must be validated in machines on buses/trams or at U bahn and S bahn stations before first journey. Backtime it for when you need to go to the airport again and get a free journey!Would I go back to this hotel again - yes.

<Content>Good Hotel Good Location I stayed at the Maritim pro Arte in Berlin for a week on business. It is very clean, modern and in an excellent location. It is just down the street from the S-Bahn train - Freidrichstrasse Station. It is within walking distance to all the major sights. The staff is courteous, helpful and they speak excellent English.The breakfast buffet is pricey at 20euros but fairly boutiful. There are lots of eating options close by including for coffee-aholics a Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks right down the street.They do not offer free wi-fi you have to pay 15e per day to use the (wired) net from your room.Only one English channel - Skynews.No soaps or shampoos are offered in the bathrooms. However, the towels are plentiful and you get a bathrobe.

<Content>Great Location This hotel was in an excellent location, within walking distance of Brandenburg gate and the museum island. There are great restaurants and other attractions also close by. Access to public transportation is also very close. It took about 15 minutes to get to and from the Tegel airport (~18 euro fare). The hotel was developed around a very nice idea of putting modern art from different artist all over the hotel and a different artist on every floor. Unfortunately, it is not easy to access floors, room key gives you access to only your floor. The hotel itself has little charm and a few over priced restuarnts. The breakfast buffet in the Gallerie restaurant was good with food options for travelers from the US and Europe. Internet access was 15 euros a night. Rooms were shabby and needed to be refurbished. Liquid handsoap was in the shower with no other common items like shampoo, bar soap, lotion, rooms have no iron. All things you would expect at a Hotel of this prices and one that claims to be for business travelers. Hotel staff were nice but poorly prepared for large crowds.

<Content>The proArte - a cultural experience The proArte is a modern, business-oriented hotel with a few twists - particularly a heavy investment in contemporary art, with each floor given a specific theme by an individual artist. I was on the 11th floor, whose theme was 'Homosexuality'. If you are easily offended by the concept, you probably shouldn't visit Berlin, which must be one of the most gay-friendly cities in Europe. However, if you don't want to be reminded as you head for breakfast every morning, you might not want a room on this floor. The 11th is also a smoking floor - I had booked a non-smoking room but arrived quite late and didn't disocver the mistake until I was inside the room. However, it had good airconditioning and was well-cleaned so I decided not to make a big deal out of it. The breakfast was outstanding and the service pretty good - a blown light bulb was promptly replaced. The bathroom was also clean and well-maintained. The biggest downside was probably its proximity to the US embassy and its fortifications, which close off one end of the adjacent street to cars and place pedestrians under some very hostile surveillance. The Russian embassy, in contrast, manages with one sleepy police officer out front. Has to be a moral here somewhere. Overall, the Maritim proArte offers a more interesting experience than the average business hotel and I would certainly use it again.

<Content>Central location. Great for business This is a large modern hotel with excellent facilities, situated near the Brandenburg Gate.You enter the hotel through a spacious atrium which is decorated with an interesting selection of various arts.The rooms are large and airy and fitted to a high standard. Beds are very comfortable.Eating is well catered for and the restaurant provides a varied choice of dining. There is a choice of two bars, usually with a pianist playing in the evening.As with many large hotels the staff tend to be less friendly and more formal, though courteous and efficient.I am always happy to return to the Martim proArte.

<Content>Great location! We just returned from 5 days in Berlin, with 3 small children. We were pleasantly surprised by our room and the hotel location. I read reviews on this hotel and am very happy we chose it. We had an apartment on the 3rd floor. We had no view, but didn't really care because we were not in there too much. Our room had a small living room and seperate bedroom. The couch folded out to a bed for our 5 and 3 year old, and the hotel provided a crib for our 1 year old. The room was kept very clean, as was the rest of the hotel. They also have an indoor swimming pool. My 5 year old loved it, but it was a bit too cold for Dad and the 3 year old. So, they drank a smoothie from the pool bar and watched.Our biggest mistake was thinking that breakfast was included in our rate... it wasn't. My husband and I were charged 19 Euro a day each, all 3 children were free. Actually, as much as my children ate, we probably came out ahead. I can not imagine what was missing from the breakfast buffet. There were meats, cheeses, breads, fruits, yogurt, cereal, eggs, omelet station, bacon, sausages, and waffles. It was huge and kept pretty well stocked every morning... even when it was very busy. But, just so you know... there is a bakery, a Dunkin Donuts, and a Starbucks right outside of the hotel. I also want to mention a restaurant close by that is well worth stopping in. It is just across Unter den Linden to the right. It's called Pepitos and it is wonderful... try the Pepito special.The location was a great bonus. There is a bus stop 2 minutes outside the hotel and a big train station (Friedrichstrasse) 5 minutes walk.. with an elevator for strollers and wheelchairs. From that station, you can get pretty much anywhere. It is one stop out from the Berlin Hauptbahnhof.I always read these reviews before booking travel, yet this is the first review I have written. This hotel worked out so well for us that I decided it was time to write my own review.

<Content>Excellent Downtown Hotel Booked in by Martin Randall Tours (London) I found the hotel very convenient for walking in the area of the Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, down the Unter den Linden to the Museum Insel, Berliner Dom etc. The Fredrichstrasse S Bahn railway station is close by, only one stop from the new Berlin main railway station. Altogether a well serviced excellently located hotel.

<Content>Good hotel in a great location Beeing there for two nights during a conference held in that hotel was nice.The breakfast buffet is wonderful, sitting close to the Friedrichstrasse in the morning watching the people in a hurry is great.The food has always been very good, the service staff is polite and nice.The room had a lot of damages at the door, I wouldn't have expected that in a hotel with such a price. Downside was the organisation of the conference regarding the coffee and lunch/dinner breaks. Whenever you try to make a conference there and you have exhibitors keep on watching the hotel doesn't change your plans in making breaks close to the exhibitors. In our case they moved the lunch away from the lobby to the restaurant 1 floor lower than the exhibition and conference rooms. Having that nobody will visit the exhibition...If you just need a good business hotel in a great location where you can walk to the Friedrichstrasse, Unter den Linden, ... it's a good recommendation.

<Content>Perfect location in downtown Berlin I was in Berlin last weekend, 22.04.-23.04. with my 7 year old son, stayed in the Maritim proArte for the first time.Reservation was done by a major german touroperator, payed 104.-- EUROS, one night, double room, bed and breakfast.The hotel is only a short walk, round the corner from Friedrichstrasse train station in a mid city, but quiet location. Our room was on the third of eleven floors, the top-floor for this fare.Room was not big, but large enough for us, well designed and fitted with a bath-tub.Nothing to hear outside. Buffet breakfast with a wide variation of different bread rolls, jam,fruits, eggs, cereals, all what you want.Staff was very friendly at the frontdesk and in the restaurant.We asked for a 2 pm checkout, no problem.A small indoor pool was also there without further costs.All in all a great stay in a perfect location.

<Content>A good place to stay I've been in Berlin for the Real Berlin Marathon and I've stayed in this hotel. Definitely not bad. A modern building, very close to a lot of beautyful places and very conveniently placed near a subway/railway station.My room was big and very clean, the staff was really friendly and did their best to help.I won't be there for this year's marathon, but I hope I won't regret it, because there everything was just perfect and I had a good time!

<Content>fantastic place to stay The hotel is right in the heart of the city. You can walk to all the main sights and friedrichstrasse station is just a hop away. The hotel has been decorated to a high level, lots of marble and large pieces of art in the foyer. The rooms are good with large en suite. Friendly staff and an excellent breakfast buffet. I'll stay there again when I go back.

<Content>Nice, well located hotel I stayed at the Maritim Pro Arte on a visit to Berlin in December 2003. I really enjoyed the hotel. Rooms were nice, bathrooms were spacious, staff was friendly. There was a delicious buffet breakfast included in the room rate, complete with made to order omlettes as well as all the usual treats.The location is great. It's on friedrichstrasse about a 5 minute walk from unter de linden (sorry -- not a german speaker), and about a 10 minute walk from the brandenburg gate. The friedrichstrasse metro station is also just steps away. Also, a bit of a longer walk is an area called orientburgerstrasse,(?) which had some fun ethnic restaurants and nightlife.The only down sides were that I thought things within the hotel were a bit overpriced. I ordered tea in the cafe one day, and it was 5 euro, which seemed a bit over the top, but maybe that's just how much things cost in that part of town. Also, my sister who lives in Berlin joined me for breakfast one day, and the charge was 25 euro, which again seemed a bit high for me.
