<Content>Great Place to Stay Spent two nights at the Hotel while attending the Cotton Bowl. My wife and I enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone visiting the Dallas area. Members of the staff were some of the nicest people I have met working in the Hotel industry. When we needed directions, they were there to help. When we needed the shuttle, they responded without hesitation. In addition to a top notch staff, the hotel was first rate. Our room, as well as the hotel itself, was clean and well maintained. We experienced some TV issues dealing with HD channels, but those issues were minor and did not diminish our overall experience.

<Content>Very nice for business travellers This is a very nice hotel for business travellers. It is more a mini-suite than a full suite. There is a large, comfortable couch and ottoman with a beautiful 42 inch LCD HD TV, free internet and the usual business amenities. Rooms are very clean, well appointed and very recently remodeled. The closet is small and hard to get to, but this is a small problem. The staff was incredibly attentive, very courteous and provided service on par with a much more expensive hotel. The food was above average but expensive. Sodas were uncommonly expensive (nearly $3 for a 20 oz bottle) but...This is NOT a good hotel for small children and the rooms do not have a separate room/living area like a true suite hotel (such as Embassy Suites).

<Content>Amazing hotel for this price range! Midweek prices in Dallas can be a real shock so I was looking for a better priced alternative to the usual place I stay while in Dallas for a quick trip... They will be sorry that their midweek price sent me to the newly renovated Hyatt Place because I will never go back after finding this hidden gem on 75 near 635! What a great surprise... I read the reviews on here saying it had been redone and upgraded with 42 flat screen televisions but for the $129 price for a Wednesday in Dallas I was blown away by the boutique hotel feel and extremely courteous front desk staff. The room was perfectly appointed with granite counters, mini fridge, wonderful comfy beds and that wow factor 42 flat screen... I didn't think I'd get any sleep because I was so happy enjoying my room! A pleasant continental breakfast is embellished with some great custom order and pay options and the starbuck's coffee choices and constantly available crisp granny smith apples have made a quick fan of me. I'll be back again and again and again.

<Content>Great place to stay in Dallas This is now the Hyatt Place, Dallas Park Central.....fantastic rooms with a 42 plasma television, and brand new furniture and amenities. Felt like we were staying in a much more expensive boutique hotel. Brand new super comfortable bed, wet bar, refrigerator, and fold out sofa. Located almost next to the High Five interchange at 75-North and 635, there was a bit of traffic noise, but nothing that keep us awake. The staff was friendly and attentive, and especially Kim who among her other duties, drives the courtesy van to any location within 5-10 miles. Definitely a find in a sea of bad choices in Dallas

<Content>Very Inviting My husband and I stayed at Amerisuites for three nights. We drove to Dallas to see a comedy show and just have a long weekend. The service is very friendly. The rooms are exactly as they look on the website. Not luxury but very much acceptible for the price. Our room was very clean and all the amenities worked properly. Take advantage of the free breakfast, it was actually very delicious.

<Content>not very nice When I got to my room it was musky and then I realized the airconditioner didn't work.. They changed my room and there was a leak under the sink..they changed me again and the room was ok.. the rooms are dark and depressing and you and you can hear every noise. the breakfast was nothing special even though they advertise a bountiful buffet its not. This hotel is not even close to being 2 1/2 stars. maybe 1. If you have a choice stay away.

<Content>For business travelers only Stayed at the Amerisuites for one night with boyfriend. The hotel is really clean although I did receive a double room when I reserved a king room. The problem was fixed very quickly.The room was clean although in no way shape or form a suite in my opinion. There is a wall that separates the bedroom from the sitting area and I found the room the smallest suite I've ever seen. The kitchen is functional with small fridge, microwave, and stove. However, the problem is insulation. We heard every noise going on outside from the construction, the people upstairs, the people walking by outside in the hallways. There is no insulation to guard against noise. Didn't get a good nights sleep at all. The heating unit is one of those in the wall units that only heats the immediate area which wouldn't be a problem if Texas was not having an ice storm that day so it was freezing! The breakfast buffet was decent as long as you don't mind warming it up. There are very few restaurants nearby and the staff is not very knowledgable. I would not return but may be economical choice for business travelers

<Content>Loved It Hotel was fantastic, well presented and clean. Staff were lacking local knowledge however were very friendly. Breakfast was plentiful and free. Suites would suit family, strongly advise to hire a car as hotel a bit out off the way from down town. Places worth seeing South Fork Ranch, 6 Flags theme park, Billy Bobs(Fort Worth)
