<Content>Loved it, perfect this was an excellent hotel at a very affordable price for tokyo. Smack Bang in the middle of things, it was a little noisy at times, but that didn't bother us one bit. Probably more suited for young travellers, and people who aren't too precious about where they stayed. Overall, it was good value for money, clean, staff were friendly and looked after our bags, before check-in and after check-out. the location was superb - couldn't ask for more for the price we were paying
