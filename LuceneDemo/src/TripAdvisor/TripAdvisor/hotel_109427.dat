<Content>There's plenty of better options I stayed at this place for quite some time while on a summer job. I was not at all familiar with the Dallas area and just wanted to find an affordable place close By the time I realized that it wasn鈥檛 the greatest place to be, I had already committed to the monthly rate, and was going to end up paying a whole lot more if I moved out. Make sure you know what you are getting into before you sign up to stay here for a long a period of time. The neighborhood is BAD, period. There are a couple of office buildings and warehouses around, but otherwise it鈥檚 mostly your friendly neighborhood liquor and adult stores all around. The parking lot is poorly lit and feels very unsafe at night. After my first week, my car got broken into and I lost my stereo and some other stuff. One of the staff persons said that it happens on a fairly regular basis. The reason I picked the hotel was for convenience because it was close to downtown, and it was convenient to get to work for the most part. However, if you are trying to get out during the peak hour, traffic coming into the medical center blocks out the feeder and makes it a hassle to get out. The closest grocery/shopping without having to worry about safety is a good five miles away. I used to drive over to the other side of downtown in the lemmon/knox-henderson area to do all my shopping. It鈥檚 not too bad once you get used to it. There are plenty of good restaurants in the uptown area and that鈥檚 not too far either. About the hotel itself, it鈥檚 average at best. It鈥檚 supposed to be renovated, but all the kitchen appliances are falling apart and the air conditioning is fairly old/loud. But the shower was good and the bed was comfortable and that鈥檚 what I cared about most. The room was pretty spacious as well. The do have a DVD player that barely works, and cable TV sucks 鈥?very few channels and no comedy central or HBO. Instead you get Showtime which plays the same two shows/movies every night. As for internet access, don鈥檛 forget to pack that old modem because the wireless internet ($5/stay) is much slower than dialup. Several calls to the 鈥榯ech help鈥?turned out to be frustrating and futile. There is a laser printer in the lobby, but it鈥檚 a real pain to use. Among other useful stuff, local/toll-free calls are free. There is a weird odor in the corridors but it didn鈥檛 bother me that much. There is a laundry room on the first floor and a small gym (mostly cardio stuff, no weights). The front desk sells detergent and provides change as well. There is a vending machine that has some basic stuff, coffee, snacks, etc. There is a small pool, not in great shape. There is also a small conference room that you can use if you need. I must say the staff is very friendly and helpful, although for the most part there is not much they can do. There is free breakfast on weekdays, but it鈥檚 nothing great 鈥?just plain bagels and some fruit. Housekeeping is once a week if you stay for more than a week, but I think that is pretty typical of extended stays. You can have it cleaned on other days for ten bucks or swap out towels at the front desk for no charge. I had a couple of packages shipped over, and the front desk will accept/hold it for you. Overall, not a bad place if you staying for a couple of nights and are not overly worried about safety, but I wouldn鈥檛 want to stay at this place for too long. If you have to work in downtown, consider also places on 75N, near the Northwest freeway, it鈥檚 not too far and I think is a much nicer neighborhood with a lot more stuff to do around.

<Content>Good for the Price Visited Dallas over New Years and was able to get a room for $30 a night. The hotel was very good for the price. The location is right off the Highway and you have to access it by using a service road which could be a pain at times but overall wasn't bad. There really isn't places walking distance to go, but a short drive if you have a car. The rooms were large and comfortable, only had a problem with the shower draining but nothing major. If you plan on using a taxi you may have issues, it took about 45 minutes to get a taxi so be prepared for a headache but that has nothing to do with the hotel itself. Overall this a good hotel for the price. It was my first visit to Dallas and would likely stay here again If I return.

<Content>Not the best area of town! The hotel looks clean enough on the inside, although our room did smell like smoke. There is a workout room and a coin laundry room. The hotel is the nicest one in the immediate area, but the part of town overall is not great. My husband's truck was broken into during the night while it was parked in the back of the hotel, and his car stereo was stolen. Everything else was left in the truck. Spots in front of the hotel fill up at around 7:00 p.m. There is a security guard outside at night, but he is older and uses a walker, so I am not sure how much help he could have been even if he had seen someone breaking into the truck.
