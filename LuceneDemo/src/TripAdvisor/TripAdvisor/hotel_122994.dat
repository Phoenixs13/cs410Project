<Content>very quaint! This was our second stay and I have to say that there was tremendous improvement - our room was very clean with new drapes and furniture. Even the walls were nicely decorated. Most importantly we are light sleepers and the place was QUIET, even on a busy weekend. We plan on coming back!!!

<Content>stay at your own risk II was staying there when a stranger knocked on my dood , thinking it was my girlfriend, I opened the door. A stranger fo,rced his way into my room,where he robbed me of excess of fifteen hundred dollars cash and took my car keys and stole my car. my car was recovered, less more than twenty thousand dollars of gold chains and diamond earrings. the owner subsequently contacted me,telling me that i could no longer stay there.when I returned to pick my belongings up,Ifound that rather than being held at the office as I hah been advised they would be,what was left of them was out by the garbage.I lost in excess of four hundred dollars of medecine,alcohol,dvd player,dvds and kitchen ware.the manager refused to address my losses, instead dwelling on his ability to exclude me from his establishment.

<Content>Terrible! This was a Terrible place. As soon as we got there some drug dealers attempted to sell us drugs. I feared for my child. We went in and locked the doors but we decided an hour later to get a refund and leave after we heard a gunshot in the room next door..AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

<Content>Don't go there We stayed there on Fri, Feb 14, 2003. We payed $48.60. The location was OK, but the hotel itself was terrible. The hotel was very noisy and each room wasn't clean at all. Just try not to go there.
