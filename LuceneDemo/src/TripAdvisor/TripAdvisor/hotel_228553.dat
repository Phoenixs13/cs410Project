<Content>Great hotel Stayed here on a working trip here and it was a fabulous hotel.The hotel is very clean and the rooms are modern. There is what looked like an old balcony (it is still there) but the door handle is not on there any more. so dont expect a balcony. Was not bothered about the view as we did not spend much time in the room. I was in a single, but had a large double and when we checked in, we ventured out, and came back and we had a bottle of wine and a fruit bowl left in our room and compliments of the manager (possibly to do with our job role)The location is brilliant. I must warn you though, do not go by google maps as it is in the complete wrong direction. The hotel is inbetween Diagonal and Verdaguar metro stops, not by the Hospital. Which makes it a better location that it is on google maps!The breakfast was basic but nice and the staff were very friendly. Checked in and out with ease.Overall a very pleseant stay at the hotel!

<Content>Your Stuff May Just Disappear!!!! - Room: nice clean and renovated. Very big. We had a separate TV room and a big balcony!! However, both TVs in room didn't work!!! We didn't mind since we were tired at night anyway.- Breakfast: Lots of choices but greasy- No nice communal area. You basically come in and go to your room- Location: close to Passeig de Gracia - Far from Rambla or port. Location felt very safe but if you want to walk to places, this is going to be a long walk. - Service: Cleaning lady moves your stuff!!!! I travel 50% of my work time and never use closet and keep my stuff in bag. The cleaning lady put my clothes in the closet and closed the closet door. We didn't check it when leaving. I called and they charged me 45 Euro to send me back my stuff. I agreed since my expensive brand belt was left there. Guess what? My cheap old clothes arrived AND THE BELT DISAPPEARED!!!!! I called and emailed and they just ignored me. Somebody there liked my belt and just decided to keep it AND charge me 45 for sending back my dirty t-shirts!!!!!!! Now I call this really really really bad service. Very unprofessional and not acceptable for a 3 or 4 star hotel. I don't feel safe in this hotel and am lucky that only my belt is disappeared, since if they take a belt they may take whatever precious!!! I wouldn't go back or if I were you, I wouldn't take any precious items around!!! Also the concierge is not helpful at all. While staying there we asked couple questions and they just acted as if we are annoying.

<Content>Really nice hotel Me and my husband went to the Catalonia Corsega for a city break earlier this month. The hotel was very clean and very quiet. It is in an excellent position to visit the Sagrada Familiar by foot. The only thing I would warn people about is the road the hotel is situated on - Calle de Corsega is a long road that runs across the city with the Passage de Gracia running through the middle, we took the bus from the airport and got off in the centre. It isnt clear on the directions and we turned the wrong way down the road, altogether it took us 2 hours to find the hotel. The breakfast was really good with a wide choice. We found all the staff to be pleasant and would definately go back.

<Content>Fantastico!! Lovely little gem! I took my son to Barcelona for his 13th birthday. We loved this hotel. We felt well cared for by the friendly staff. Twin Room was clean, restful, and marble bathroom especially nice. Sleek interior design and lighting made it seem very glamorous, while the old architectural details in the central lift stairwell and lobby columns gave a European quaint feeling. The breakfast buffet was excellent with abundant food, gracious setting and service. We ate heartily each morning, set off for sightseeing, then had a prix fixe lunch or tapas around 2pm, and back to the hotel for rest.The location was quiet (August -- so many neighborhood businesses were closed) and safe. We could easily navigate from our hotel, plan our day, and take the metro, bus or walk. The stations were all within about 20 minutes walk. Several beautiful Gaudi buildings were nearby, as well as rows of early 1900s apartments with balconies.  It reminded me of some of the small boutique hotels in NYC (which European travelers favor). We felt  quite continental  at the Corsega Catalonia.

<Content>Good Hotel, Good Location... Hotel was as good as the previous reviews i had read. My partner  i stayed for 4 nights and were given the 8th floor (top of the house!). The bonus was that we got a roof terrace - only 1 of 2 at the hotel - so ask for room 802 or 803!! Room, although on the small side, was clean. Everything you would need. Ideal location from which to explore this wonderful city. Just minutes from Passaig De Gracia which leads down to La Ramblas - about 20-25mins walk. Plenty of designer shops intermingled with tapas bars, restaurants and coffee/ice cream houses. Take the Tourist bus and see the whole city - north and south for just 鈧?9. Do the rest on foot and savour the hustle and bustle of this city. Not the most polite of people - this part of Spain is renowned for that - but it didn't ruin anything for us - just added to the experience!

<Content>Great hotel I stayed here with a friend (i.e. we鈥檙e two 33 yr old laydeeeez). Breakfast was very good (although the tea was a little weak and not hot how us British like it!).It's about 20 mins walk to Las Ramblas (whilst walking you pass many designer shops, coffee shops and bars).The sight-seeing bus pick-up point is about 5-10 min walk (in the same direction to Las Ramblas),where you can pick up buses which tour either north or south of the city.Although the hotel is on the outskirts of the hustle  bustle, it's nice and quiet (so you can sleep in peacefully). We didn't hear any of our neighbours.The road outside seemed to get busy with traffic, but there鈥檚 double-glazing, so not a problem, but then we were on the 6th floor.There are black-out curtains. The safe is 4 Euros/per day (40 Euros deposit). The tv could be better, the only English speaking channel was CNN (there are pay per view films).Lots of mirrors throughout which is great when you鈥檙e getting ready.The room isn鈥檛 especially luxurious, quite basic looking really, but it鈥檚 clean and comfortable.Bathroom is clean, with a bath  good shower. There鈥檚 a fridge, but no tea  coffee making facilities.Most people at reception spoke good English, but you can get by without too much of a problem. I would stay at this hotel again.

<Author>ChesterManchester
<Content>A good hotel!! Just got back from Barcelona and found the hotel to be everything theother views have stated. The hotel was very clean and comfy. The bedroom was the same and the king-size bed was fantastic. Air conditioning was a great relief and the black out curtains were a real plus. At 10am it felt like midnight..only the traffic noise from the single glazed windows gave away the time.Bathrooms again were good but a little dated.The breakfast was good with plenty of choice but the hot dishes were barely luke warm. The staff were reasonably friendly but you have to accept that that you are in Catalunya and most people in Barcelona are ignorant and not hospitable. Service in most restaurants and barsI found to be poor with a couldn't care less attitude..compared to the more Southern parts of Spain. If you try speaking a little Spanish they ignore you...just stick to English as they understand every word you say. Use the tour buses..19 euros for 1 day or 23 euros for 2 days gives excellent value. Just beware that you will ripped off in the bars at Port Olympico....11 euros for 2 bottles of lager is a scandle!!The hotel is a fair way from the main drag of Passeig de Gracia but there is still a lot of decent bars/restaurants in the area...well worth the 拢90 per night..!!

<Content>Good.. sort of. The location is great - a short walk to the Barri Gotic and Passage de Gracia with plenty of opportunities to stop off for coffee (or beer/wine) on the way. The room that we had was very small. Well more narrow than small, and had absolutely no view (i.e. coundn't see sky). Our travelling companion had a larger room with a really good view, so there you go! This didn't really bother us, as we only had three nights in the city so not much time was spent in the room. Overall the hotel is clean and the staff friendly. Would go again.

<Content>Fantastic Stay Our stay in the hotel was fantastic and could not be faulted. The staff were extremely friendly and helped wherever possible. Although the hotel was quite full, our room was quiet and we managed to have a lay in or two after some late nights without that noise you usually get in busy hotels. This is mainly due to the good layout of the rooms. The A/C in the room was great. It is very quite and works extremely well, not like some of the noisy malfunctioning ones you get in some hotels! It would have been nice to have a pool, but we were never really there so much during the day, so we would not have used it anyway. It is close to Diagonal Metro stop. We took the train from the airport to the hotel without a problem (a few stairs to deal with on the Metro though). The location of the hotel is also in a very good and in a safe part of town with lots of shops and places to eat down PG de Gracia and further up Av Diagonal. A lot of the Gaudi Modernist buildings are also nearby. Although not close to the Rabalas, I would rather stay in this location where it is safer and quieter. Breakfast at the hotel was awesome and saw us through the day until a late afternoon snack. 10/10! I would definitely recommend this hotel and go back there should I visit Barcelona again.

<Content>Catalonia Corsega Hotel. Plus for quality. Minus for location. Stayed at the Catalonia Corsega hotel in Barcelona in July 2006. It is a lovely business style hotel. Inviting lobby, comfortable and clean rooms, large marble bath, mini fridge, and COLD air conditioning. STaff was polite and helpful. Got a rate of 75 euros on the Internet. Unfortunately, it is not in a good location for visiting the major sites. There is nothing much to see close by, and it is a good 10 minute walk to the Metro station. We like to stay near the center of historic sites so we can come back to the hotel to rest and freshen up. Nest trip we will try for a hotel closer to Las Ramblas or one of the major squares. We were warned by other tourists, though, that some of the older hotels near Las Ramblas don't have cold air conditioning, so check that out before making summer reservations.

<Content>Great city, great hotel Booked as part of a package so we were a little apprehensive, especially reading some of the reviews here. In fact the hotel was great and comparable with any four star hotels we've stayed in.Room was a good size, bathroom very nice, marble walls and nice touches like a bidet and complimentary shaving kit. The downsides were the TV channels, only CNN News was in English and we had a rear-facing room, with a view of an adjacent apartment block.We booked on a bb basis, breakfast was very good, fresh pastries and cereal, good choice and friendly staff.The hotel has the advantage of being in a quiet neighbourhood with the proximity to all the main attractions. Although it's a good 30-40 minutes walk to La Rambla from the hotel, the Metro station is near (Diagonal) and really easy to use. To walk to La Rambla you pass through Passeig de Gracia and Place de la Catalunya, which are very pleasant for shopping and also contains Gaudi's La Pedrera and Casa Battlo. La Sagrada Familia is only about 5 blocks away.The hotel is on Corcega, which was right in the middle of the August festival with streets bedecked in colour and live performances, which topped off a great stay. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Would stay here again Four of us visited Barcelona from 7/11/04-10/11/04 and stayed at this hotel. I was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews, but I cannot disagree strongly enough. The hotel was spotless, including the rooms, and even though we only stayed 3 nights, the sheets were changed on the third. The breakfast was wonderful, buffet and no limit to amount. The evening meals were a bit limited (for my taste, and the only reason I didn't give 5 stars) but excellent value, 12.62 euros for 3 courses incl wine, water and coffee. The chocolate ice cream is to die for! The staff were pleasant and helpful and the hotel is well situated. We were 6 floors up above the front street which was quite busy, but the rooms are triple glazed and noise wasn't a problem, even though I am a light sleeper. When I return this will definitely be my first choice.

<Content>So, so Just returned form 5 nights at this hotel and while it was merely okay, it somewhat lacked in friendliness and cleanliness.The front of house staff were absolutely fine and helpful, however, the restuarant staff were another matter. Breakfast was served between 7.30 and 10.30am, however, if you arrived at 10.15am you would be abruptly told you had one minute to get your breakfast from the buffet, they also started to remove the breakfast at 10.25am. There was not one smile or friendly face at breakfast. Dinner was pretty much the same, however, the food was value for money. The bedroom and bathroom were merely skimmed over each day, with horrendous dust balls under the bed and in the corners and badly smeared taps etc. in the bathroom. Our sheets were not changed once.While the hotel was okay, it is DEFINITELY NOT a 4 star hotel (although the blue plaque outside on the wall does have 4 stars).In addition, the hotel was extremely noisy with people shouting on the stairwells, doors slamming very loudly and football being played after midnight on the second floor (we were on the 6th!!!). We found it was very well located, just off Pag. de Gracia with Catalunya Sq and La Rambla a 20 min walk down Pag. de Gracia (2 metro stops). Also Sagrada Famialia 10 mins walk away, La Pedrera and Casa Batllo 5 mins walk down Passeo de Gracia.If you want more information please contact me.

<Content>Great hotel, friendly staff, clean rooms This hotel was lovely, the reception staff were more than helpful, the rooms were very clean and a really good size. The marble bathroom was also very clean and the shower was fantastic!The location was ok, it is a little far out from the main streets, and it is advised that you learn your way around before you get there, or at least carry a map at all times! We stayed for a long weekend, and had learned the route back to the hotel from the main street by the time we were leaving! It is however only about 15-20mins walk to Las Ramblas which is handy.We had breakfast every morning and there was a good selection of food, with a cooked section, cereals, fruit, croissants, toast and a wide range of toppings!Overall it was a lovely hotel to stay in, especially when we didn't really spend much time in the hotel. It was a good base, and was very quiet so we could sleep well and rest our tired legs from all the sightseeing!

<Author>gilabrand
<Content>just okay This is definitely not a four-star hotel, as we were told. I don't know how they give out stars in Barcelona. This hotel was adequate, but nothing to write home about. The double bed was very small (more like an American single) and the room faced a courtyard where you basically look into the neighbors' windows. The receptionist forgot to tell us that the electricity doesn't work unless you stick the electronic card in a certain slot. They give you only one card, so when you leave the room, the heating goes off, too. You have to make a point of asking for another card. On top of that, the maid who makes the beds always shuts off the heating, even if you leave it on. When we were there, the heating took forever to work and the place was freezing. The response from the reception was: Use a blanket. There was only one blanket and one pillow, despite the fact that it was a double room. So again we had to call reception, which made us feel like we were being pests... The location is a little out of the way unless you are very rich and want to shop in fancy designer shops. We did walk downtown and back almost every day, but it took about 20 minutes of brisk walking each way - and it is worth bearing in mind that the metro closes down at midnight. On the plus side, it was quiet, as opposed to hotels on the Ramblas and the buffet breakfast was filling, with enough to eat even for those who don't eat meat.

<Content>Excellent Location Visited this hotel in July 2003 and was very very pleased with this 3* Plus hotel which is situated in the heart of everything. Minutes walk to Catalunya Square, La Ramblas (where all the shops and restaurants are), the Metro (very cheap 1.05 Euro's for a single trip anywhere, safe, clean). If you want to walk everywhere, it is possible but where suitable footwear...we walked to most places...it was fun, but tiring towards the end of the day. The Port is about 10-15 minute walk...good nightlife there.Situated on a busy pedestrianised street (which is brilliant for shopping) but peaceful inside. Rooms were a good size for two, A/C, amazingly clean, bathrooms all marble. Good choise of breakfast. Staff were very freindly and helpful. Alberto at reception was especially good and helped us find places to visit.I would definately recommend it. Please email me if you want further information. A littel tip...learn some Spanish before you go there....communication is a problem.
