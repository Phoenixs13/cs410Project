<Content>Highly recommended I stayed at the Suites Del Angel whilst attending the World AIDS conference in August. The city was busy and I had stayed in another hotel for one night which just didn't compare. Although the hotel is old and a bit dated I found it clean, certainly the rooms were a lot larger than expected and the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fair.I loved the area, it was convenient for most things and if you got lost you just asked for directions to the angel and everyone knew where to send you. I would definitely stay here if I ever had the good fortune to visit Mexico again. There are some really good restaurants across the road from the hotel, give them a try you'll be pleasantly surprised. All in all a great experience, I felt very much at home at this hotel.

<Content>highly overpriced! This old and run-down hotel is totally overpriced. The suites are nice and roomy, but again, old and run-down. We paid $215/night. We had stayed just a few days earlier at Eurostar, also in the zona rosa and their suites were the same, only newer, and we paid only $67/night! Del Angel is on a nicer street, but much farther from the metro too.We were SO disappointed when we got there. Don't let the nice pictures of the lobby fool you. It doesn't look that nice. The staff was nice and helpful, but the hotel is just not worth the price.I would not stay there again, unless I was getting a room for under $80.

<Content>Nice place to stay and friendly My teenage son and I stayed here from July 24th through July 28th. The suite was very nice -- not brand new - but clean and very nice. My son slept in the entry room to the suite on a pull out couch, and watched the TV in that room. Another TV in the bathroom. The bathroom was modern and nice. I slept in the king size bed in the separate bedroom, with yet another TV. The connecting kitchen area had burners, plates, etc., including a water filter tap for drinking water. The cable TV had at least two, maybe three, english language stations with spanish sub-titles. Watched a little bit of Friends on the Warner channel. There is a really busy restaurant right around the corner, which fronted on Tiber street, which looked nice and was really crowded with locals for lunch and supper, but unfortunately we did not get the chance to eat there (go out the front entrance of Suites del Angel and turn right, and then right again on Rio Tiber, and it is there at Rio Lerma at Rio Tiber). The staff at Suites del Angel was really friendly and helpful, especially Gustavo. The maintenance man even fixed my eye glasses with a precision screwdriver when the lens popped out. There was an interesting mix of people staying at Suites del Angel - quite a few Mexican nationals I believe, as well as those from other countries. It seemed to be a good central location in Mexico City. I believe we paid around $69 a night, with booking through the AARP travel website. The Sanborns around the corner at the Monument to Independence, at Rio Tiber and La Reforma, is good for a late night desert and coffee. There was also a really popular (with locals) and interesting looking Catina if you turn left out of the hotel entrance on Rio Lerma , and go about 50 yards, on your left. I would stay here again.

<Content>Safe location and great personnel We stayed at Suites del Angel for three nights in July. We were very pleased with ur stay. you walk around the corner of the hotel and you have a great view of the Angel, and Reforma Avenue. Also, at the corner you have a conveniece store, a good MExican restaurant, and several Argentiniean, fondue, pizza restaurants. I felt very safe walking around at night and we walked to the Sanborns which is a block away.The closest metro is about a 15 minute walkso this was the only drawback. I like using the metro so this was inconvenient for my mother who has a bad knee and can't walk much, but if you don' mind the walk, it is about 5-6 blocks away (both Insurgentes and Sevilla metro stops).We chose this place because my parents are a bit paranoid about Mexico City and safety, but this place was great, calm. I walked at night and at 6 am while it was dark and had no problems. These are suites with three televisions (one in the bathroom with a phone, actually), a king bed, bath robes, sofa bed, microwave, coffee maker, sink, plates, etc. The place was really really clean, which we appreciated. The only thing I didn't like was the careting, which you can tell has been cleaned over and over, but it is old.It was about 20 more dollars for this place than the Hotel Del Angel, which is next door, but it was worth it because there were four of us and two got to stay in a king size bed while the other two stayed in a full-sized pullout bed. Perhaps if there are fewer people, the pther hotel might be more appropiate. We paid about $100 a night for our stay (the price was higher because of the four people instead of the standard 2-- if not, it would have been about $70 per night)The staff was SUPER! Gabriel, the concierge, was extremely helpful and we ended up booking three excursions to Puebla, Xochimilco and the Pyramids. He even gave us a 50 peso discount (which probaby came out of his cut of the tour). They really go out of their way to make you feel welcome. They also helped us get a flower arrangement for my parents since it was their anniversary. The chamber maid went out of her way to pick out an arrangement and surprise my parents with it. This shows how courteous they are.

<Content>Loved the Suites del Angel Suites del Angel was a pleasant surprise in every way. Given the reasonable rates, we weren't sure what to expect, but we had an excellent stay. The rooms were clean and well-tended, the front desk staff (especially Maria and Gabriel) were incredibly helpful and friendly, and the hotel itself is located in a nice neighborhood close to several nice restaurants.

<Content>Looking forward to returning to this hotel! Me and my boyfriend stayed here for a week last month and had a really good time. I chose this hotel because it had good reviews, and lo, I made a very good decision. The room was clean, small for a suite, but having two separate rooms was great- we had a few people come over for drinks one night and not haing to subject them to our bedroom was great! The shower/bathrtub/jet tub was great, tons of hot water and clean towles. Balcony was cute, we had it open the entire time we were there! The restaurant downstairs was affordable, we typically had our breakfast there. Id love to go back to this hotel soon! Concierge was helpful, though they didnt have as much to offer in terms of information as say, a more expensive hotel. They did however, get us tickets to two separate tours, which were great and well worth the $30 USD they cost. Great experience for the cost, Id give this place two thumbs up!

<Content>Nice Hotel, Good Staff, Great Location My wife and I just returned from a 5 night stay. Overall, we were very satsified with our experience. The hotel staff were friendly and responded to requests promptly. The housekeeping staff kept the runs nice and clean. This is a very nice hotel for the value, nothing fancy, but a good experience. The in hotel restaurant was decent, and there are plenty of very good restaurants near by. We were very impressed with the museums and art in Mexico city. We will definitely return and would be happy to stay at the Suites Del Angel again.
