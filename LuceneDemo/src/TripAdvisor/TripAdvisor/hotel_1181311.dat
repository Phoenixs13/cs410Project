<Content>Great Value  We stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions on our recent visit to Japan - October 2008. Its location was excellent as it was a few minutes walk from the local Ningyocho Subway plus about a 10 minute walk from the TCAT terminal. We caught the Limousine Bus (about AU$30) from Narita Airport to TCAT then walked to the hotel.It was excellent value for money - about AU$95 a double with breakfast - miso soup, choice of rice cakes, pickles, coffee/tea. The rooms were spotless and very comfortable - western style with a queen bed, table  2 chairs, room under the bed for your suitcases, TV, bathroom with bath/shower, toilet etc.We wanted to stay in the Ningyocho area as there are many good inexpensive eating places around here. Close to Ginza as well - only a few stops on the subway. We ended up staying in several of these Toyoko Inns as we traveled around Japan as they were extremely good value for money and in great locations. They also have laundries with coin in the slot washing machines and dryers plus drink machines  free internet access. We would definitely stay here again.
