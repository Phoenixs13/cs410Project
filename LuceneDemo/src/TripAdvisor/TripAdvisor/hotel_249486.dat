<Content>Nice Room - Ghetto Area We stayed for free with Choice Rewards and the rooms were ok. Very clean and soft sheets but there was no hot water (luke warm) and the shower didn't drain. The area is a bit ghetto with people hanging around the check-in area. It was quiet and they do have breakfast.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at El Portal ( now Quality Inn El Portal ) for just one night before our cruise. We had two rooms because there were five of us and both rooms were great. Yes, there were small, but they were very clean. The gentleman at the front desk gave us a suggestion for a great resturant for dinner, and the free continental breakfast on the roof was fine.

<Content>Perfect for its purpose On a recent layover between NY and the Virgin Islands, my boyfriend and I needed a cheap (ish) place to stay for the night. We had low expectations but didn't want to spend much more than $100 for our holiday time stay. This hotel was perfect. A clean room, friendly staff, and great location gave us exactly the glimpse at San Juan we needed without breaking our bank before we got to our real vacation in the Virgin Islands. We would probably upgrade for a real vacation in PR, but for our purposes, El Portal was just fine.

<Content>Not so bad! We've stayed at El Portal twice, Feb  Apr 07, both 1 nite stays. Price with tax is around $95. Both times we've been in an end-of-aisle room - comfortable, clean, no plumbing problems but definitely in need for some updating. Staff have always been helpful and pleasant. Yes, continental breakfast is fair but that's what it is - a continental, not a buffet breakfast. Location is excellent - easy walk to Ashford Avenue and many dining choices. Taxi from airport runs around $20US, includes the tip. Would stay here again. Did stay at Coral Princess - much nicer, near El Portal but about $40-$50more - better breakfast and has a pool.

<Content>Loved our stay We read so many negative reviews about this hotel we were afraid to stay here. Because we would have lost our deposit we went. All the negative reviews were wrong. The room was clean, it did not smell. There was no problems with the plumbing, no slow draining shower, no odor when flushing the toilet. All the staff were friendly and very helpful. Breakfast on the terrace, a continental breakfast, assorted pastries, cereal, coffee and juice, was a good beginning to our day. In fact, when our flight was canceled we called them and went right back for another night. I would not hesitate to go back again. Close to the beach and a variety of good restaurants. We found it to be a convenient location.

<Content>Spend more, you wont regret it. My wife and I stayed here for four nights in February. We reserved the hotel through Expedia for $85/night. We expected a decent room as Expedia rated this hotel with three stars. It was far from three stars. The hotel smelled moldy, was constantly cold (60ish), had filthy beds and was extremely damp. My wife and I got sick after the second night. We suspect the moldy, damp room played a role. The moisture in our room made the pages of a magazine so damp after three nights that they ripped when turned. Despite the previously mentioned flaws, the hotel was close to the beach and within walking distance to several bus lines.

<Content>what a dump! It seems the hotel has not changed anything since the late 70's. The carpet, the tile, the sheets, the tub, the glass, etc. It is very dirty. The rooftop continental breakfast is a joke. I was booked here for 3 nights, but left after 1. That young man behind the desk was as lazy an employee I have ever seen. He never answered the phone. When I would go to the desk to ask the question, I saw him messing around on-line with video games. Just don't do it. Don't say I didn't warn you.

<Content>Unimpressed This hotel is in a prime location as it provides easy access to the beach, buses, restaurants and shopping.However, the rooms were smelly/musty and very cold (for a Caribbean location). We turned the a/c off and the place was still too cold. The place seemed to be understaffed as well because the guy who took care of the breakfast was also the porter (on duty). This guy's attitude sucked! Although there was a language difference, there is nothing wrong with a smile and a pleasant outlook (this translates in any language). Check out is also horrible (we were in a large group (26) persons and we were asked to bring luggage to the lobby by 11:30 am our flight was 5:50 pm) Imagine 26 persons by maybe 3 pieces each in a small lobby with no seating arrangement or storage facility. It was horrible. The attitude of some of the staff members was totally disgusting.I would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends. There are nicer, friendlier places to stay in PR. (Because our group was big we did not have much of a choice - we were told).

<Content>Stay Away! Bad bad bad!!! I've stayed in hotels throughout the world and when your on the road, you can't expect much. When traveling through Mexico by car, I stayed in $10 per night hotels that were clean, with running water, and had a shower that drained. El Portal is a $100 per night Roach Motel! I made a reservation to stay at El Portal because I thought there was nothing else, but several friends of mine were able to get far better hotels for a much better price. Warning: Do not stay here, even if there is nowhere else to stay. Camp out if necessary. There are hundreds of hotels that are far better and cheaper. The staff was nice, but the hotel is a dump! The shower had no water pressure and the temperature changed from cold to superhot wihtout any warning. The shower did not drain and no amount of complaints can correct that, i'ts a plumbing issue. It was a complete nightmare. Be warned.

<Content>Terrible DON'T STAY HERE! The rooms are sooo tiny and the whole entire hotel has a funny, mold like smell. The continental breakfast includes bread, and cereal with powdered milk. To top it all of THERE IS NO HOT WATER! And they had a drainage problem, it took hours for the shower to drain after one person used it, so if you go with another person wake up early unless you want to shower standing in their dirty bath water.There are so many better hotels in San Juan for around the same price.

<Content>needs some work to clean it up Stayed for two nights here. Seemed like a decent place for the money from the descriptions etc and i thought they would have cleaned it up after previous comments. Also i thought the roof deck would be nice to relax on - until i booked in and they told me it was only open for breakfast!!! even though their web site advertises it as being available all day - is that false description?My Room had a strange smell. Especially after turning the aircon off which was previously set at very cold, maybe to disguise the smell. The carpet was sticky, i thought maybe cos of the cold damp air but it never got any better.The windows behind the closed curtains were absolutely filthy - i was able to draw a line in the dirt on the glass.The bathroom shower didnt drain properly - when i first used it the floor was slippy then after i realised why - it leaves a load of scum in there cos it drains so slowly.Also the shower was hot hot hot then cold cold cold (as previously described) without rhyme or reason. I thought it was the tap moving on its own but it wasnt - just bad plumbing i think.Cheap but not cheerful.

<Content>Great For Singles And Couples (March 2005) After reading 2003-2004 reviews about the El Portal Hotel, I was worried but I took my chances anyway. The Hotel was a lot better than what people say. I stayed in room 702 and it was a nice clean room. The room had one large bedroom and a decent size bathroom. There were a total of two rooms that were clean. The two rooms were seperated by a small hallway (which was nice and clean). Being on the seventh floor, I had a great view of the San Juan Area.  The only small problem that I noticed is the beach is 3 blocks away from the beach (which is a 5 minute walk) and there is a small private middle school school across the street, if pre-teens bother you. Also the maids only speak Spanish , but they clean your room everyday from 11am-2:30pm depending what floor you are on. The maids were extremely pleasant and they clean good. The hotel is in the right location close to Walgreens, Burger King, Subway, a Private Dance Club, A Gay Bar, Church's Chicken, Ponderossa, Pizza Hut, Local Music Store and so many other things. They offer a contential breakfast which is ceral, toast, two types of donuts, coffee, or orange juice on the 8'th floor balcony (which has a nice view and a great place to relax).  I just wish I took a decent pictures of my hotel room (sorry my thumbs were in the way).

<Content>smelly! smelly! smelly! Black stuff on ceiling. Filth in the curtains. Windows didn't open. Smell in the room. Mirror doors with so much dirt on them it was hard to see yourself. Carpet needed cleaning if not that at least a vacuam. Not as if we had an early check in. Arrived 9.30 at night. was alittle creeped out to say the least. Friends arrived the next day thought thier room was better than ours until they flushed the toilet the smell of the sewer was over whelming. Made our room smell alittle better. went out to buy an air freshener didn't help. Noise on the street was very loud. View from terrace was nice. Guy sleeping in the storage area on the terrace was little wierd to say the least. To scared to eat we were not surprised when no one asked how we enjoyed are stay. Best advise find some were else to stay. You don,t even get what you pay for here. Don,t let a anagment respone fool you.

<Content>No hot water!!! We had a last minute stay in San Juan on January 1, when all the good cheap hotels were taken. We figured we could handle El Portal for one night, despite the bad TripAdvisor ratings. It was pretty bad, folks. Our room did not have hot water, and the shower was clogged, so after determining a hot shower would not happen, we listened to water going glug, glug all night as it sloooowly drained. That is, when we could hear anything else over the insane traffic noise. El Portal is right on some kind of traffic circle or something, with people honking their horns to attempt to get around the intersection all night. Finally, this place did not give me an impression of cleanliness. I have stayed a number of places in Puerto Rico, so I know what Puerto Rico standards are, and this place did not measure up. There was kind of a bad smell in the room, and the bedcovers were stained. Summary: If you absolutely MUST be in Condado, and NOTHING else is available, then stay at El Portal. Otherwise, stay somewhere else.

<Content>Enjoyed the Hospitality My family (8 of us) stayed at the Hotel El Portal in January of 2005. We had three rooms reserved through Travelocity - they didn't inform the hotel one room was to accomodate 4 people. The staff was very helpful and solved the dilemma.Four of us lost our luggage on the flight, due to a connector in Chicago and the staff at the front desk were great - phoning and getting information on when we could expect the suitcases to arrive.They gave us suggestions on where to eat, shop, bus schedules to get around. For New Year's Eve, we got permission to use the terrace to view the spectacular fireworks which went on for over an hour and a half.This hotel is situated very close to the beach, shops and lots of choices of restaurants. Everything we needed was in walking distance, with the bus to Old San Juan close by, too.As to cleanliness- the bathroom floor the first night needed a bit more work, but the rooms were better cleaned the other three nights. The beds were clean and I found them quite comfortable - no sore back when I got up each morning. Considering the price and the central location, this was a great place to spend the first 4 nights of our 12 day vacation.

<Content>You Get What You Pay For I stayed at Hotel El Portal in March, 2004. Relative to other hotels in San Juan the price was right. It also has a good location, being fairly close to Old San Juan, the beach, and the bus stop. From the outside, the hotel is cute, as is the rooftop patio where they serve breakfast. The staff were pleasant and helpful.Unfortunately, the room was filthy. Not just dirty, but utterly filthy. It gave me the creeps to be in the room, and I did not dare walk around barefoot or only in socks. I did not mind that the room was decorated in early 1950's attic. I did mind stained sheets, a blanket that looked as if it had not been washed in several years, and a filthy bathroom. The first thing I did was go to Walgreen's and buy some disinfectant so that I could clean the bathroom. The amount of disgusting filth that I removed was enough to turn my stomach. Unfortunately, it was the height of Spring Break and every hotel I contacted was full (unless you wanted to spend $400/night). So I was stuck there for 3 nights.The price is right, but you get what you pay for.

<Content>OK for the price El Portal is OK for the price and the hotel was only 3 blocks from the beach. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms weren't luxurious, but comfortable and clean. There were some problems but the staff responded to requests promptly and resolved the issues.

<Content>You guys HAVE to be kidding! Reached the El Portal late one Friday night in Nvoember 2003, and was completely underwhelmed by the lobby, thought it would get better when we got upstairs. Rooms are small and ugly, beds are worn and boxsprings are creaky (based on 2 rooms and can't imagine the other rooms being better), and the shower in 403 runs hot hot hot to cold cold cold at will without rhyme or reason.The balding guy at the front desk with the warm, friendly personality is GREAT. He gave great customer service. Helped with directions, suggestions to eat, places to go, etc. Didn't outweigh the crappy accomodations. And the continental breakfast... I won't even mention that beyond saying that it's marginal, at best.Stayed for 2 days during my 30th b'day weekend. Was looking forward to it. The section of beach nearby wasn't exceptional either, but that may have been b/c of the rains they had been having. The next 2 days at the Wyndham in Carolina, near the airport... amazing.Save your money, and skip this place.

<Content>A neat and clean bargain My husband and I stayed at Hotel El Portal last December on our visit to Puerto Rico.It is very neat and clean and the staff is very friendly and knowlegeable. On top of that it is a great bargain for the budget traveler, only $75 per night in high season.It is a block from the beach and in the center of the popular Condado area. It is within walking distance of several trendy casinos, dining and nighlife spots.It is also very close to the International Aiprort and major highways. There is also a 24 hour Walgreens 1/2 a blcok from the hotel.We are planning to stay there again on our trip in December 2003.
