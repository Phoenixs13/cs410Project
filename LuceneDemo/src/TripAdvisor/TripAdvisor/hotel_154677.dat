<Content>Wished it was better There is much to recommend this hotel if you need to be in the southern part of the city. It is well located for that area. It has access to the mall if you like to walk outside the hotel at night and is close by Bosques de Tlalpan, a very nice little park for daytime walking. The design of the hotel interior is dramatic and attractive. The highest point is the staff. They are a fine example of Mexican professional courtesy - well spoken, attentive, quick to respond and almost formal in their courteousness, a good thing. What stops me from raving about the hotel are the rooms. It is clear that little investment has been made to ensure that the rooms are comfortable and clean. I don't mean the housekeeping but the facility itself. The beds are hard, very hard. The rugs are worn out. The furniture is shabby. I wish the owners would invest in more comfortable furnishings. Although my next business is in Coyoacan, I will stay on the Reforma because I need a decent night's sleep to be productive and the time for the commute will be the trade off.

<Content>The best five star hotel I spent a week with my family at the end of October. All the staff were very competent and extremely nice. My 3 year old son even told one of them you are my friend because we had been treated so well. We were first given a room at the front of the hotel, but I thought it would be noisy, so I rang the front desk to ask for a quiet room and we were immediately moved to one at the back of the hotel. The view from there was fantastic. Since we were there during clear days, we were able to see the Ajusco volcano and Six Flags Mexico. Our package included a trip to the theme park for my children and we planned to go on the third day of our stay, however they told us in advance that Six Flags was going to close on that day, so we were able to do something else instead, and the following day they arranged the trasportation to and from the theme park.Most of the staff spoke good English and I was delighted to discover that their taxis have seat belts and are driven by excellent drivers. We used two standard taxis from the airport and from the North bus terminal and after the fright I wasn't sure how I was going to get back to the airport to get our flight back to the UK. Luckily the drivers from the Radisson proved to me on several short trips that they could get us in one piece to the airport! They were more expensive than standard taxis but to me they were more than worth it.The food at the restaurant was also great -and well priced. When we visit Mexico we tend to eat at Sanborns restaurants because we've never been ill and their food is nice. However the food here was superb, and for breakfast they even had a pianist playing all sorts of music, which we certainly appreciated. Another thing I liked was that they even catered for people like me with milk intolerance, so I was able to enjoy cerals with lactose-free milk.I've stayed in a couple more of five star hotels, but this hotel is the best for me!

<Content>Wonderful time in Mexico City We just returned from a terrific week in Mexico City (10/07). We fell in love with this huge but surprisingly clean and beautiful city. This reaction was primarily due to the excellent private guide we hired to show us the sights. Based out of the excellent Radison Paraiso, Tonatiuh Vazquez of Xanath Executive Services spoke impeccable English and pandered to our desire to spend most of our time at the archaeological attractions. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Teotihuacan pyramids, the Anthropology Museum, and the Circular Pyramid, as well as our visits to the Xochimilco boats and chinampas, Zolcolo, and the markets of San Angel. Tony provided in depth commentary about all the locations and about Mexico City in general -- and he even pulled over to get us some of the best coffee and hot chocolate in all of Mexico City!

<Content>Perfectly Adequate Stayed here while attending a conference at UNAM (University) nearby. Conference rate $100. Wireless internet $11.50 extra, fast connection. Clean, good a/c, friendly staff. Interior of hotel is pretty nice, with character unlike many large boxy hotels.

<Content>Very very nice hotel! Normally I am not a Radisson fan, but this is a beautiful hotel - services are great, the people are very friendly and I found I really wanted for nothing while I was there. Highly recommended if you need to stay in this southern part of Mexico City. It is a bit removed from the downtown area, which means you will easily spend an hour in traffic to get to the Zona Rosa. Near the Coyoacan neighborhood though, which is fantastic and worth visiting.

<Content>January 8, 2004 - No Wireless Connection We arrived via air to Mexico City on Thursday, January 8, 2004. It took about 40 minutes from the airport to get to the Radisson Paraiso via taxi. This was at 4:55 PM The fare was $385 pesos. It is important when we travel to have internet access for our business. When I called the 800 Reservations number in the U.S. I asked if they had wireless internet connection in the room as I could not get this information from their web site. I was told by Reservations they had wireless connection in some rooms but these rooms are more expensive. $180 for the first night and $130 for the two additional nights we stayed.When we arrived at the Raddison check in was very courteous, efficient and friendly. We got to our room and there was NOT wireless internet connection. The bell boy, the front desk clerk, the Manager and the engineer all got involved trying to solve this problem. The only means of connection is with a dial up system. The engineer was kind enough to configure my lap top so I could use it in the room as I did not have a server in Mexico City. Because this type of connection is done with a regular phone, I have no idea why the extra charge for the room as all rooms have phones.If anyone needs computer access as we do for business when away from their home office, please note the Radisson Paraiso does NOT have wireless connection in the room.The beds are VERY hard.It was raining one night so we did not venture out for dinner and had a bowl of soup at the hotel restaurant. First it was cold so sent it back but even when they returned it hot, it had no flavor and did not eat it. We were not asked why it was not eaten. This was the only meal we had at the hotel but would not recommend it.The concierge was excellent and I'm sorry I did not get his name. The manager is Bejamin and did a fantastic job helping with our dilema upon arrival with the lack of wireless internet service.I have to give the entire staff an A+ for the courteous manner they handled this situation, correcting an error their reservations department made.There is a mall across the street.Sunday morning at 10:00 AM we took a taxi back to the airport to leave and it was a 20 minutes ride and $280 pesos. The exchange rate is now 11 pesos to one dollar.

<Content>Review of Radisson Paraiso I stayed three nights in the hotel in March 2002. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a five. The check in was efficient, and the staff was friendly. They claimed not to honor my United Mileage Plus card for miles. I was too tired to argue. I asked for a non-smoking room witha single queen or king sized bed, but the only non-smoking room had two twins. The beds themselves were very hard, and the sheets were a bit stiff. The ceilings in the room were a bit low. The bathroom was pleasant, with a large shower. There was no tub. My room faced the main street, so it was noisy with the toot-toot of cars well into the evening. The hotel is on the south side of Mexico City, so if you have business in the central part of the city, you'd be better off staying in that area. The hotel is right across the street from a large shopping mall (Perisur), which has some nice stores like Zara, Liverpool, MNG, and Sears. the mall also has a cinema.The hotel offers a breakfast buffet for 110 pesos (about USD 12), with made-to-order omelets. Unfortunately, it's supposed to open at 7:00, yet was not open when I went there at 7:20. The bar has live entertainment, but when I went there on a Friday night, it was absolutely dead--I was the only customer, listening to a duo play English language pop tunes. The hotel is one of those empty center places, the hotel rooms facing the inside of the building. The hotel is about 40 minutes away from the airport (on a Sat morning), and 50 mins from downtown (on a weekday afternoon). The tourist cab rate from the hotel to the airport is 240 pesos.
