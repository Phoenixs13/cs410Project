<Content>Very pleasant stay at this business-oriented hotel My favorite thing about the Frankfurter Hof is that it is centrally located. It's about a 5 minute walk from the Hauptbanhof (main train station), near lots of offices and a short walk to shopping (and the Christmas market in December). The lobby is nicely appointed. There is fresh fruit and water near the check-in. Newspapers are around the corner as you head to the restaurant. The staff are helpful and friendly. My room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. There was good closet space for a hotel room (with a small safe for jewelry/laptops). The bathroom was nice. The hotel has a turndown service that leaves you chocolate. There is a gym on the 6th floor (it was included in my rate; not sure if it is always free). If you are looking for English language TV, there isn't much (CNN  BBC only). At 28 euros, I decided that breakfast at the Frankfurter Hof was too expensive, but had plenty of alternate breakfast choices nearby - Starbucks, a bagel place and a cafe with Mercedes Benz cars - were all across the street. This is my 3rd or 4th stay at the Frankfurter Hof. I like the hotel a lot and find it convenient for my business travel.

<Content>huge rooms, huge breakfast and great staff! It took us a little time to find this hotel as no-one we asked seemed to have heard of it, despite being described as the grandest of the grand in frankfurt! Look for the skyscraper with the poiny green bits on the top - its right near that. The room was huge with a separate dressing/safe room and biggish bathroom. The 'buffet' breakfast was superb and a very extensive offering with omellette/egg chef. The staff were all delightful and nothing was too much trouble. Our only complaint was not enough info in the room about the other services, such as the spa - we might have had a treatment if the info was more readily available. And my other half's pet hate - no tea/coffee facilities in the room! With room service being rather pricey and given the standard of the hotel we felt this was a little mean.We had a great night at 'Zu Alte Germana' in Sachsenhausan, which is a medieval style bar and eatery which was so authentic we felt we'd walked into a time warp and private medieval party! Also Klosterhof restaurant near the hotel was great value and (like everywhere it seems) enormous portions!

<Content>Not 5 stars This is definitely not worth the money charged - claims to be 5 stars but the property is old and fading, furnishings are worn, needs redecoration. Service is ok, but no added value anywhere - pay for everything (and high prices) even water in the room. Far overpriced.

<Content>Nice Hotel in the Heart of Frankfurt Stayed two nights at the Steigenberger Frankfurter Hof on business in April 2008. The outside of the hotel makes it look like an historic venue; the sleeping rooms are more akin to an old Marriott. That is not necessarily a bad thing, just don't expect opulence or a sense of grandeur. The rooms are large enough (especially compared to other hotels in Europe) but the furnishings are standard and the bed is nothing to write home about. My bed had no sheets and a comforter that wasn't big enough to cover the entire bed.Service was prompt and cheerful. The room service food definitely could use an upgrade -- typically European runny scrambled eggs were not very appetizing.Still, overall this is a fine place to stay in Frankfurt since its downtown location is a major plus. Most business people would not find too much to complain about here; I am merely pointing out some of its (minor) weak points so readers will not expect to be staying in a five-star luxury property.

<Content>Terrible Experience with this Hotel This Hotel is run down and has a terrible cancellation policy. I was originally booked for April 5th and had to change to April 3rd due to a death in the family. I attempted to explain to them I had to leave Germany early due to a death in the family, but both Expedia and the Hotel would not budge and required I pay the full rate for April 5th booking and re-book another room on April 3rd.They have an odd cancellation policy-basically, if you book through a travel agent there is no opportunity to cancel or change the reservation. The Hotel is in bad shape, well past the need for renovations.In the main restaurant, Oskars, they charge 11 Euro for a bottle of mineral water. This is $17.00 for a bottle of water! When I complained about it on my bill, the management of the restaurant laughed at me. I was tired of my ordeal with this hotel and went to bed so I could awake for early flight and found the temperature and air in the room very uncomfortable.

<Content>Stay here if you have to We stayed here during a big trade fair so occupancy and rates were both high. The first room that we were offered smelt of drains. We complained and were shown another room on the same floor that had the same aroma - indeed we were told that renovation works were in progress and that this was a known problem. We were shown a third room that stank of cigarette smoke - so we stayed with the first one and were moved the next morning to a more fragrant room that was noisy...The main restaurant in the hotel is excellent although the breakfast room was like an airport lounge and not very agreeable. The reception staff were not particularly helpful although the concierge was both friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great Location -- otherwise just ok Stayed three nights on business and found the stay enjoyable but not special. The hotel is centrally located in downtown Frankfurt -- convenient to business, restaurants, shops, the main train station and only about 15-20 minutes from the airport. The outside is most impressive; inside . . . well, read on.The lobby is spacious with lots of marble. However, it doesn't take more than a handful of people to make it seem crowded and noisy. The hotel bar is attractive and non-smoking. Service was prompt and prices were what you'd expect. Originally, I was offered a first floor room on the main street; when I asked for something more quiet, I got it, although with a view of the air conditioning system. The standard room was . . . standard. The ceilings are very high, giving a feeling of spaciousness and the room was relatively large. The furnishings included a double bed that wasn't particularly comfortable and a chair and ottoman that were. Decor was unmemorable and somewhat dated. TV was large but not flat screen. There is an in-room safe that is easy to use.The bath is small but modern, with lots of marble. The towels are unacceptable -- thinner than you would expect at a Motel 8 and you only get one bath towel and one hand towel -- not sure what you'd do with two people in the room. Amenities were replenished daily.Internet is expensive at 12 Euros/hour with no option for a daily charge. Thirsty from your trip and want a bottle of water? -- it will set you back 7 Euros. I did not dine in the restaurant or order room service. Elevators were relatively prompt given the size of the hotel. You can easily program your wakeup calls on the phone. Hallways are very wide but, for some reason, hallway noise gets into the room and thus, when the luggage carts roll by early in the morning, you hear them.The concierege was especially helpful both in providing information and in making restaruant suggestions/reservations. There is another staff member dedicated to helping with train/bus connections and I found her assistance invaluable.Overall, the Frankfurter Hof was acceptable in every regard but at no time did I feel that I was staying somplace special. On previous trips to Frankfurt, I've stayed at the Hessischer Hof and would definitely recommend that over the Frankfurter Hof if you are looking for a smaller property with more inclusions.

<Content>Old World Graciousness When we arrived, for some unknown reason we were upgraded to a deluxe room. The room was enormous, quiet and well-lit, with two marble bathrooms and every amenity one could imagine, including a pants press. Every inch of the hotel is beautiful; every staff person was as kind and helpful as could be. The location is in the center of the city. Meals at the restaurants were delicious. Our stay here was a singularly spectacular experience. We recommend it wholeheartedly.

<Content>Excellent hotel Stayed 4 nights at the Frankfurter Hof while in business, and it was a very good choice. Details...GOOD:--Rooms are great - good size, plenty of closet and drawer space, comfortable bed, reasonably well appointed and very clean.--Bathrooms were very well equiped, clean and elegant (though small)--Common areas were very well kept and pleasant--Staff was very helpful, in particular some folks at the concierge desk who helped out with a few things--Breakfast buffet is quite good--There are other restaurants attached too - Oscar's was good, didn't try the other ones--Location is good, right in the heart of townBAD:--The workout room is pretty bad. A treadmill that didn't work right, a stationary bike that didn't either, some weights and a bench.Overall an excellent property, good choice in Frankfurt. Definitely recommended. Prices can be a bit high, but they do run some deals at times.

<Content>Looks better from the outside I stayed in the Frankfurter Hof for one night while on business in July 07 on the recommendation from a German friend that it was 'the' hotel to stay in while in Frankfurt. It looks very impressive from the outside and the inside is very plush, but unfortunatly that is where it ends.I arrived into my 鈧?20 shoebox which consisted of a tiny single bed pushed against the wall. I immediatly went to the reception to seek a better room and they had no problem doing this. I was changed to a slightly larger room with a double bed. The room was old and the furnature and fittings were all dated (not antique). I had a bad night in a poor bed. When I toldmy friend the next day of my experience he said that he never stayed there - he just thought that it looked fancy from the outside!!for the money I paid I'm sure there can be somewhere better to stay while in Frankfurt.

<Content>Luxury accommodations in Frankfurt My stay began inauspiciously as my NeverLost directions kept taking me to just across the street from the hotel where they apparently had just built a new street - so I could see the hotel but couldn't get there from here. This is a very formal, stately hotel, smack dab in the middle of Frankfurt. Lots of formally clad help standing just outside and just inside the hotel. Rooms are fairly good sized for Europe but everything is extra, and somewhat ridiculously priced ($5.00 for a bag of nuts or a bottle of water; 12 euros for an hour of Internet access). But that aside, it is a comfortable, albeit dear, place to stay when in Frankfurt.

<Content>A good property Frankfurt Main is for the most part a business and transit city. Since the mid 70's I have stayed at most of the hotels in and out of town but starting a few years ago I have been staying at the Frankfurter Hof. Whilst it presents itself as a 5 Star hotel I would give it a 4 Star rating, it is however in my opinion the best hotel in Frankfurt Main.It is well located right in the center of FFM and close to the main Fussganger Zone for the department stores at Hauptwache.Many of the rooms have been renovated which I strongly recommend over the unrenovated rooms so check out the room or ask at the Reception Desk before they assign your room.Several good restaurants on property.Frankfurt Main plays host to many Fairs or Conventions so check the schedule to avoid paying higher rates during those periods.

<Content>Traditional hotel close to the city centre The location of the Steigenberger Frankfurter Hof is perfect, in the middle of the banking district and just a few minutes walk from the shopping areas and the Old Opera. The hotel has an old-style sandstone facade, but most of the rooms seem to be renovated.My room was very spacious, nicely decorated and clean. It had a large desk, a nice bathroom and a walk-in closet room. However, the room was overlooking the inner courtyard of the hotel, so the view was not so nice.The breakfast buffet in restaurant Hofgarten is great, and the service in the restaurant was very friendly and efficient. There is also a nice bar with a large terrace during summertime.A public parking garage is available across the street for some 25 Euros per day. Valet-parking is available.

<Content>Fabulous hotel My husband and I stayed here last summer in a deluxe room. The hotel is gorgeous. Everything about it is wonderful. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. Our room and bathroom were large and clean. The bed was very comfortable, and the shower was great. The room service food was good, and came in huge portions. The only downside would be that you have to pay at least 20 euros a day for parking. We will definitely stay here on our next visit.

<Content>Always been great for us My wife and I have stayed at the Frankfurter Hof five times since 01. We always book a DLX JUN. SUITE. Great beds with duvets, first class bathroom with flat screen tv over the tub, BEYOND clean. There is a very nice SPA area on the top floor. Though it is not a bargain, for Europe and five star hotels, we find it to be a great value. The only downside that we found was a snooty bartender, other than that, EXCELLENT. We will be staying there again this Sept.

<Content>One of the best in Frankfurt Stayed at this hotel once. It has a very convenient location,close walking distance to the Zeil and Goethestrasse.I had a junior suite, it was luxurious and probably oneof their refurbished accommodations as it looked way betterthan the pictures displayed in the reviews below.It was a one-room suite yet very large, with a sitting andworking area,all newly and luxuriously furnished, highceiling, luxurious new bathroom and a walk-inwardrobe with safe etc.All service was perfect and so was the meal i had inthe restaurant downstairs.On other occassions, I stayed at the Intercontinental in Frankfurt.The Steigenberger has a better location and is more luxuriouswhile the Intercontinental offers great views and the benefitsof the Club Lounge (in case of booking a club studio/suite).

<Content>Very good Hotel, superb restaurant My travel agent recomended this hotel and booked the three nights I stayed. What a choice! It is a beautiful old style sandstone facade city center hotel with very good service. They said it was renovated recently for the soccer world championship and gave me a very good room. I invited a local client for a business dinner to the french restaurant one evening . He was realy impressed. The food and service was very upscale. The price was also, but absolutly appropriate.Next time I'm in Frankfurt i'll stay there again.

<Content>Watch out for rooms below the gym ... Whilst noting (and understanding) the mixed nature of the other reviews, I do try and stay at the F Hof when I'm in F'furt, because: (1) very convenient for most of the client meetings I'm likely to have (investments) (2) character - and, yes I know that the unrefurbished rooms are not really value for money - but at least it's typical of its type (ie: mature, German hotel) - and I would always chose it over the identikit Hilton (more modern that it is). I have always found the front desk staff, bell staff and room service etc to be fine (although a bit slow on r/s this time) - but may help if you are a repeat, business visitor. However, one note of caution - this trip I was offered room 518 (nice, large refurbished etc) - and all seemed fine - until a pounding started on the ceiling above .... although I thought I was on the top floor, I had forgotten the gym, which must have a running machine directly above 518. I called reception - and they confirmed that was what it was but should stop by 10pm (was then 9.45) - and if not, we will intervene. As it happened, it did stop by 10 - but for anyone with small children or who wants to sleep early I would refuse rooms in that vicinity.

<Content>Overpriced and tiny I booked this hotel directly and specifically asked for one of the refurbished rooms, based on the reviews here. As promised I DID get one of the refurbished rooms, but how disappointing!! I got a room smaller than my bathroom at home in London. I am used to hotels here in Europe being small, but this was ridiculous - I could only climb in bed from one side! The bed filled the entire room. The bathroom was so minute that it would be easy to sit on the toilet, wash your hands in the sink and take a shower all at the same time. I'm only 5ft5 but my knees were pressed against the bathroom door whilst 'using the facilities'...!Seems funny now but I certainly wasn't laughing when I checked out - 鈧?00 per night plus tax. Stay at the Hilton. This place must be laughing all the way to the bank.

<Content>Overpriced and poor service We recently returned from Gemany where we stayed for 3 nights in the Frankfurter Hof. The service wasn't great and cerainly not what I expected from a hotel of this standard. We requested soya milk with the breakfast which it turns out on the day they did not have, We also requested in advance non-allergy bedding - which again was not supplied. We also booked a massage through the reception which we were overcharged for. The airconditioning was broken throughout our stay and the room was hot and uncomfortable. it is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location - I am only sorry I cannot say any more positive things about it!
