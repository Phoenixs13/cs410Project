<Content>From old Hanoi to East Berlin - Purebob involved again ! Stayed at the Mueggelsee hotel for a conference.Firstly - know that this hotel is in East Berlin as was - and it is an hour's schlep in a taxi from the airport to get here. It is no mean feat to go to the town centre to dine, for example, so you are pretty much stranded here.Hotel is set in lush forest at the edge of Lake Mueggel. Almost all rooms seemed to have great views.Check in and pubic areas all very impressive in this hotel - spacious, interesting and well kept. Bar quite intimate a fun, although the service from very young and indolent waitresses bordered on unacceptable. My room was very spacious and comfortable with a patio area overlooking the forest. Very nice indeed.Bed a bit soft and pillows VERY soft, but perhaps that is the personal preference of other folks.The conference food was quite decent.Best of all was the bowling alley in the basement ! Much fun was had here during the conference evenings ! I did not try the swimming pool or gym.It was a fine conference hotel, and I can imagine it is a peaceful retreat for folks wanting a quit civilised break by the lake too.Just don't expect to be close enough to Berlin to spend much time there from thid hotel.

<Content>Very friendly and efficient First appearances can be deceptive and in this a perfect example. It's as it it's been built to look as unattractive as possible (it was built back in the days of East Germany) however once you're inside things take quite a different turn. The staff were all very friendly and exceptionally helpful providing excellent service constantly throughout our stay. Whilst not the most modern hotel it is very clean and probably a good average in terms of decor and general appearance. The bedrooms were fairly spacious, clean, and quiet. We were there for some corporate education and we were given everything we needed quickly and efficiently, and the conferencing facilities overall were bright, modern, and spacious.This hotel is in a great location so would make a good base for a long weekend stay. It's just a shame the building looks more like a 60's office building rather than a comfortable hotel - just remember to keep you eyes shut as you arrive until you're well inside the building.

<Content>A pleasant surprise We stayed for four nights at this excellent hotel and were very impressed by the standard of accommodation. The food was some of the best that we have found in terms of quality, variety, and quantity. Staff were helpful and courteous. We could not ask for better, which added greatly to our enjoyment of our short holiday in Berlin.
