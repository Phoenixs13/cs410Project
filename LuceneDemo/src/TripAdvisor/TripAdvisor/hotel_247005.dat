<Content>Great Place We stayed here primarily because we have two small children (3 years and 4 months) and because my wife specifically wanted a kitchenette. This was one of the few available in SF.We stayed in suite 300 (corner room). My mother-in-law stayed with us as well. The room had a separate bedroom and kitchenette with a living area with couch that folds out into a bed.Everything was great, staff was plesant and helpful. Location is great (by the cable car line and by Fisherman's Warf). Drawbacks: I'm a deep sleeper and the cable car outside didn't bother me at all. My mother-in-law was a different story - she's not a deep sleeper. However, we had the room right next to the street so this may have played a role in this. Elevator is small but doable.Nice things: The bedroom has a LCD flat screen TV with a bagillion channels!!! Not that I went to SF to watch TV but it certainly went above and beyond.Parking! Parking in SF can be a problem. If you decide to use the enclosed parking at the hotel just be sure to know that it cost $20 a day (plus tax), it is limited (so you better reserve), and you must leave the car keys with the front desk when you are not using it. This was never a problem for us. However, if you have a very big car, getting it in to a parking spot can be a bit of a problem. You have to rememebr that SF is compact and to get a parking spot is really a luxery! Plus it is enclosed! All in all - great! This Hotel really worked for us and if I was staying in SF again, I would definetly considering staying again.

<Content>perfect for family vacation Having a kitchen saved our family a lot of money by not having to eat out for every meal. The seperate bedroom was great to put the kids down for a nap. The room was nothing fancy but clean. Good location for tourists. Cable car is right out the front door. Staff was very friendly.

<Content>Great staff, not so great facility My 2 adult daughters and I stayed here as time share owners (not at this location) for a long weekend getaway. The location was great, about a 15 minute walk to the warf, and 1 block from Ghiradelli square, but it was extremely noisy. Other reviewers did post that the trolly starts early, around 6:00am and stops late. That was ok with us, but the noise from the buses and people go all night long. We were on the 2nd floor (they call it the 1st floor) with a corner room and it was terrible. The kitchen was extremely lacking and we could not even get the wine opener to work. We took it down to the staff and they couldn't get it to work either. There was one small saucepot and that was the only cooking pot or pan in the entire place. The unit we were in was worn, but we were told by the staff that they'll be undergoing a remodel in the spring of 2009. The noise from other rooms, especially the room above us, was also an extreme bother throughout the night. A family was staying above us and the kids were running and jumping and the TV was on very late at night, and very early (4:00am) in the morning. You could hear everything. We were there for 3 nights and got no sleep any of the nights. There is also no A/C in the unit, and if you want it cooler you have to open up the windows, making it even MORE loud with the outside noise.The staff, however, were extremely friendly and helpful. And there's a nice outdoor patio on the roof.Overall, we would not stay here again as you can't sleep here.

<Content>Great alternative to a small hotel room! The Suites at Fisherman's Wharf is a great alternative to a small hotel room. The location is great, very convenient to the Wharf area and to local transportation. It is also one block from the famous Buena Vista Caf茅 and their famous Irish Coffees. The suite was clean and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to our friends.

<Content>Had a great stay We really enjoyed our stay! It is a great location, very conveniently located to Fisherman's Wharf and all methods of transportation. The one bedroom suite we stayed in was very comfortable and spacious. The staff were all very friendly and very helpful, giving us directions and advice for the places we wanted to go each day. The rooms were clean, the bed was very comfortable and although you could hear the cable cars, it didn't bother us and we did not really notice any noise from other rooms. This is the perfect place to stay if you are visiting the city, the kitchen facilities allowed us to have breakfast in the room each morning and then we were off to sightsee for the day. When we were leaving, we learned that the hotel will be completely updated in the next year. All in all, we felt the place had a lot of charm and we would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great place to stay This is a great place to stay. I was really apprehensive after reading the previous reviews and expected the worst - hence this first ever review, so that others are not put off! Our family - 2 adults and 3 young kids stayed in a one bedroom suite. Yes, you can hear the trams from the living area (our kids sleep through everything so they were on the sofa bed) but the bedrooms are quiet. The decor within our suite was dated but hey, the most important thing is that it was clean and safe.The location is fantastic and you are in walking distance of Starbucks, supermarkets and great restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at Suites at Fishermans Wharf My husband and I spent 6 days at Suites at Fishermans Wharf. We really loved the location since it puts you near lots of areas to eat and explore. There was plenty of space in the one bedroom suite. It had a nice size living area and a separate Kitchen area. You can hear the Cable Cars on Hyde street but we didnt mind that at all. It added to our SF experience. You could hear people moving around in the suites above or adjacent to us but that was not a problem for us either. There is no A/C but it was not needed. All we had to do was open up a window or the patio door and the room cooled off. It was the end of july and the weather was very cool and breezy. It was a nice break from the Texas Heat Wave we were escaping in Austin. Staff was friendly and tried to push some time share talks on us on arrival but did not harass us after that. The decor is a little dated but seems to be up to par with other Condo/Timeshare Suites we have stayed in. We will definitely stay here again and will recommend it to our friends/family.

<Content>Great Family-Friendly Lodging We just came back from a wonderful week's stay at the Suites at Fisherman's Wharf . I don't understand some of the otherguest's gripes. Maybe they expected too much.It's a European style propertywith a small lobby and elevator. We had a third floor suitewhich overlooked the bay. The bedroom was a good sizefor us and had a ceiling fan and tv. Our daughters' stayedcomfy on a sleeper sofa which also had a tv. The kitchen was fully equipped and was utilized daily forbreakfast and lunch. We were fine with the small bathrromthat had a pocket door.The Hyde Street location was convenient to public transportation.If you're looking for clean, convenient, reasonably -priced San Francisco lodging, this place can't be beat!

<Content>the scoop The hotel does have a great location for Wharf activities and connecting to public transport. The desk folks are very helpful as were all the staff we met. There are 4 floors, but as in Europe, the main floor is not # one. A European small elevator available. The Suites is on the corner of North Point and Hyde. Both busy, noisy streets. There are 3 2 BR suites. Each of those is on Hyde Street. The Hyde Street cable cars start around 6am and end, at least last night 2/24, at 12:30 am. It truly sounds like about as much noise as when you are riding ON the cars . The sliding glass door on a small balcony in the living room and large window in one BR make it impossible to cover the fierce sounds of clanking wheels and machinery climbing Hyde, bells, etc. The rooms numbering 04, 05, on each floor are probably the least street noisy. But there must be no insulation between floors. TVs and voices are easily heard from other rooms.This place is owned by Shell Vacations Club but it seems they have forgotten to put it on a maintainence schedule. I was very surprised to see holes in our drapery, very faded bed covers, uncomfortable mattresses, sofa looked as if from a thrift shop. But if you stay at other Shell Club facilities, you know they can be just a tad past the fix it up stage. As long as things remain this way, and most of it is unfixable, be cautioned that staying here you may be paying more for less than at very nearby places like Holiday Inn, H Inn Express, and Marriott.My photos are unavailable due to the unfortunate event of my digital video and still camera being stolen from my checked luggage on my NWAirline flight.

<Content>Terrible Experience I spent the night with my three sisters. We stayed in a suite that had a kitchenette. The room smelled old as did the entire building. Defintely not worth the money. Also, I was accused of stealing an iron from the hotel. I do not iron, nor do my sisters. I was appalled at receiving a letter stating that I was being charged for a missing iron. When I spoke with the General Manager, I asked if he had checked the cleaning personnel. His response was that he totally trusted his employees but he did not trust me. My God, I spent $352.52 for a suite, DO YOU REALLY THINK I WOULD NEED TO TAKE A FILTHY IRON FROM THIS DIVE?????????????????? I will tell all my associates, employees, firends, family and everyone else going to SFO to AVOID this hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Great place to stay My husband and I stayed here from a Friday to a Monday. It is in a great location on Hyde street just mins away from Fisherman's Wharf and the trolley car line. Another review talked about the noise of the trolley cars, but my husband and I had no problem. The staff were very helpful and the suite itself was very spacious and the bed very comfortable. Beautiful area to walk to and from Fisherman's wharf, Little Italy etc. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone who was thinking of staying there!

<Content>A great location and large unit First off, we're owners with Shell Vacations Club, which owns this resort. We were quite pleased with the accomodation, which is located right near Fisherman's Wharf. There is a cable car that stops just outside, several bus stops, and plenty of activity (shops, restaurants, Ghiradelli Square, etc) within a few blocks. The units are all suites, meaning you have a separate bedroom, living room (with pullout), bath, and full kitchen. We really appreciated the amount of space we got. The unit was tastefully decorated, but some things were slightly outdated (such as the dishwasher which was a little hard to figure out). The staff was very friendly, including the Shell Vacations Club concierge who was NOT pushy at all about the presentation (or update for current owners). If you've ever stayed at a timeshare place, you probably know that the staff CAN be pushy - she was NOT. All in all, a very nice stay. We'd definitely return.

<Content>hope you dont like a/c! This place is a total dump. $300 a night for the best room in the place....and with no air conditioning. Of course there is a/c in the whole place EXCEPT in the rooms. When I called the front desk about why it was so hot in the room, the front desk person was rude and hostile and said, oh well it's broken, just open the windows! The next day when I asked why there was air conditioning in the whole place but the rooms, another very unpleasant front desk snobby person said how should i know why the architect designed the building that way. obviously that wasn't the truth, and obviously no one cared at all. This was for 4th of the July for a great view of the fireworks off the wharf. The view of the best room in this place is terrible! There is a very large building directly across the road. So yes, you can see Alcatraz, as long as you go out on the balcony and look to the right, you can kinda see it. The decor was non-existent. The room service was a service of a company near the hotel, not the hotel itself. Overall, there is nothing to reccommend this place except location. It's an expensive dive and you would be better off staying at the holiday inn on fisherman's wharf. oh ya, there is lots of street noise, so it's impossible to sleep with the windows open, so it's not like i was trying to be difficult, it was hot!

<Content>Superb location My wife and I spent 4 nights here in October and would certainly return. The #1 attraction is location. While locals might disagree ,we wanted to be in the touristy area. We were within walking distance of the wharf , ferry departure, Ghiardelli square and we were on the Hyde St. cable car line and city bus transportation. We were outside the fringe of more family and budget minded accommodations and near numerous restaurants and bar/pubs. (Gary Danko's restaurant across the street - reservations well in advance , expensive but well worth it). The room/apartment with kitchen and separate bedroom was certainly adequate. It was spacious and had a balcony overlooking the street. It was noisy as other reviewers have stated but we found the bedroom quiet at night. The staff was efficient and very helpful especially with restaurant advice and holding our luggage for us since we arrived well before check-in time. We continued our holiday in wine country and on departure day most major car rentals were within an easy walk.

<Content>Things to consider before staying My family of 3 just spent 7 nights in a one bedroom corner apartment (with sofa bed) on the 3rd floor with a balcony looking out to Alcatraz. Sounds great I know, however, you will read comments from others that they think the rooftop balcony is a great place to hang out - wrong for those on the 3rd floor. We could hear everything - even the chairs move. It was very annoying when we were trying to sleep at night and people were up there. The location of the property is great for seeing San Francisco and it is great having an apartment vs. a hotel room. There is a convenience store a block away for sodas and snacks. We never made it to the Safeway 4 blocks away. And yes, the trolley system runs up and down Hyde Street with a stop just out the hotel entrance - again beware, the trolley starts very early in the morning and sounds like a sworm of bees coming up the hill so there is no sleeping in. A bus line runs in front of the property so you have the added noise there as well. No one slept much the first part of the week. One day it was actually very warm in San Francisco and found out there was no air-conditioning and no screens on the windows so sleeping at night was difficult. Again, it was better than a small hotel room for us. I only have small complaints about the hotel itself. We had trouble with the t.v. remote in the living room most of the week and asked twice for a light bulb for a burned out lamp in the living room but we never got one. When asked about our stay at checkout time I mentioned the 2 things and got the impression they didn't really care so I don't know why they asked. Again they were minor things. Should we visit San Francisco again I'm not sure if I would stay at the Suites again or not. As I said, it was great having a living room, kitchen, bed and bath vs. just a small room with 2 beds - the noise is what would steer me away. By the way, when visiting be sure to purchase the 3-5 or 7 day trolley passes. One trolley ride is $5 and you can get a 7 day pass for $24 which was a good savings. Hope this helps.

<Content>Could have been better The Suites at the Wharf is on a good location especially for moving around the town. It is just up the hill from the trolley that takes you to Union Square. So the location can鈥檛 be beat.I had a one bedroom Suite on the second floor that overlooked the neighbor鈥檚 home that was being painted. So there was a strong odor of something. When I complained to the front desk about the odor they suggested they could spray aerosol spray to cover the smell. Having asthma I didn鈥檛 take this option. The manager came up to the room and try to explain hotels had a tendency to have odors that were unpleasant. We went out and figured we would air the room out however the home next to the Suites was being painted. Because of the odor I landed up have some issues. The hotel doctor is very nice. He is expensive but nice.I asked for a room change but was told the hotel was full but I can call back at midnight and talk to the night manager. I called to request a room change and was given the option of a room directly next to the one I was in or one across the hall. I took the room across the hall because it didn鈥檛 have an odor. My niece and I went out for the day and came back in mid-afternoon and the same odor was in the room again. When I called down to the desk the only thing they could say is that this is the odor of the hotel. All in the staff hotel was not very helpful with the odor. On my last day there I found out that the hotel was painting rooms on the 3rd floor so the odor may not be there all the time.The other issue is that the hotel does not have a concierge there all the time to assist with your plans or day trips. They have strange hours for days (9am-11am) and nights (6pm-8pm). The kicker was that they called my hotel room 3 days after I checked in asking me if I wanted my welcome kit. Welcome kit is nothing special it was the materials that I picked up at visitors center.Don鈥檛 use the room service. The food isn鈥檛 worth it. You can find great restaurants down on the Wharf or surrounding areas. Also plan to eat early and go to the grocery store and get snacks or drinks. There are no vending machines in the hotel. San Francisco seems to close down earlier in the winter than in the spring and summer. Don鈥檛 take the suggestion for the nail salon in the book. There is a nicer and cheaper one on Beach St. The one they suggest is in the Point Center (stripe mall) it is the size of walk in closet and shabby. Highly recommend the trip to Alcatraz at night. The tours are more organized and interactive than the day trip and there are less people on the island so you can explore it a little more. Highly recommend the Muni pass. It鈥檚 $5 one way on the trolley and $1.50 for the bus one way. The pass is well worth the cost. Also don鈥檛 get on the bus in the AM before students arrive at school or workers go to work (hard to get on and off where you need). Same goes for after school.

<Content>A Great Find in San Francisco I had real trouble finding reviews of this property prior to our visit, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.We were delighted with our stay here and would recommend it to anyone wanting more than just a hotel room in a fantastic location.The 1 bedroom suite we had was very spacious and had full kitchen facilities - dishwasher, microwave, fridge/freezer  cooktop (no oven). This allowed us to cook our own meals, which was great with two small children. Safeway and Trader Joes were 4 blocks away and we walked there. There was also a laundry downstairs.Unlike the last reviewer, we found the bed to be extremely comfortable. The bedroom did face the common area and the lights were on there all night, but the bedroom had both a venetian blind and a roman blind so it was pitch black with both those closed. We asked for a room at the back - meant we had no view, but it was lovely and quiet. The rooftop patio had great views, especially at night. Our kids loved having their dinner up there as it got dark.The staff were always helpful and when we had plumbing problems, they were fixed within 5 minutes.This hotel is in a great location, a couple of blocks up the hill from the Hyde cable car turaround. There is also a cable car stop outside the door. It was easy to walk down to Fishermans Wharf etc., even with two small children.It wasn't cheap at $189 per night (through Expedia, which was cheaper than booking direct), plus $10 for a rollaway - but nothing is cheap in San Francisco! We felt it was really good value and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Old, musty and noisy This hotel looks like it was an old, converted apartment building. Parking is tight and they charge you $20 per day. You have to leave the key with the front desk. The air was stale and it smelled like mold/mildew. If you open an outside window it faces the street where the bus stop is. The bedroom windows face the common interior hall, with lights on all night.The bed is very hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom is uncomfortable, the shelf above the toilet prevents you from sitting comfortably.It is clean, and the staff was curteous but strict.I would not stay here again.

<Content>Very good location It is very good option to stay in San Francisco touristic area. It is in Hide Street and you can take the cable car in hotel front door. It is also very close to everything in the area. The view from the top of the building is wonderful and you have some tables and chairs to apreciate the views and pic nic. The rooms are well equiped and have everything you need to enjoy your stay in San Francisco. Few blocks from the Hotel you have the Boudin bakery, Safeway Supermarket, and electrical cars equiped with GPS tours.
