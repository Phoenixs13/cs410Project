<Content>Average Hotel Like others that have written a review on this hotel. It has a fantastic location almonst halfway down on the main stretch of La Ramba which is fantastic. I was very relieved that our room was at the back of the hotel not facing the main street as it was the start of the semi finals and finals for the World Cup and I don't think we would have got much sleep.I would suggest that when you check in that you make sure you check things like the air con to ensure it works correctly and that the Trouser Press is not broken. Their website says that all rooms come with an iron but they definiately don't have these. We had to suffer 2 nights without aircon which was horrendous as it was so hot. Slept with the balcony doors open which was fine the first night as it kept us cool but only because there was a thunder storm that night. Trouble is the next night all the mossies came out so my partner got bitten alive - I must have been very lucky that night. We finally managed to get a different room on the Saturday night for the last 2 nights of our trip and slept soundly thank goodness.If you go to Barcelona I would always suggest going around March/April or very early May but not later than that as it gets too hot to walk around and see the sights without having to get into a shop to cool down with their air con! One of the best things we did whilst there was get a 2 day bus tour from the place de Catalunya and did all 3 routes to see all the sites - expensive but boy was it worth every penny!Would I go back to this hotel - probably not as like to stay in other hotels in various locations of Barcelona!

<Content>Fantastic location. Hotel Flor Park is a modern, clean and stylish hotel (more of a travelodge really) situated in the absolute heart of Barcelona's lively La Ramblas district. The building itself is atractive and our room had a balcony which overlooked the stunning La Rambla strip. The rooms were spotlessly clean and the reception service was excellent and professional yet friendly too. The area is lively and noisey which is what you would expect staying in the heart of the city but the double glazing is so good you can't hear a thing with the windows closed. There is full air-con so overheating is not a problem. I would recommend this hotel to visitors who are wanting to be at the very centre of everything but if you wanted a more relaxing and luxurious hotel then perhaps look elsewhere. If I were to return to Barcelona I would book this hotel again.

<Content>Great location but overpriced The location on La Rambla was excellent but the facilities were not worth the price charged. We booked superior room with advertised free internet connection (none). Room had small terrace with a step from the room almost one metre high, same height to get into shower/bath. 2 metre high wall on terrace so had no view of La Rambla and we had to pay for wifi which didn't work on our floor.Hotel was very clean but certainly not worth the money and we supposedly got a cheap price through Lastminiute.com.Not suitable for anyone who is not fully mobile.

<Content>Great location! The location is perfect. Just outside the hotel you have La Rambla, full of restaurants, bars, shops, etc. Walking distance to the subway.Room very small, but very clean and comfortable. In Barcelona, there's so much to see that there's no reason to stay at the hotel during the day. With that in mind, I reccomend this hotel as it is a very good deal.

<Content>When location means everything Situated in the middle of Las Ramblas the hotel is perfectly located for everything! The double room was small, the bathroom was small and the tv was small but we spent little time there. It was a place to sleep and we slept very comfortably. The aircon worked - very important in summer. The staff were helpful, the communal areas were nice and the doormen at the entrance gave a feeling of security. Overall a great spot.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, wonderful location I've just returned from a 3 night stay in Barcelona and can highly recommend the Flor Parks hotel. I was lucky that I booked this through laterooms and got a fantastic deal of 鈧?2 per night for the room. This rate didn't include breakfast but that's no problem. The location of the hotel is fantastic, on La Rambla, across from the Gran Teatre de Liceu. The guy on reception (daytimes) was incredibly helpful - full of advice on where to go, where to shop etc. The room was quite big in comparison to rooms I've stayed in in Paris for example. It was also spotless with all the usual toiletries supplied and cleaned every day. Our room faced the front, overlooking La Rambla but, once the window was shut was very quiet. I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again on my next visit to Barcelona - and I will definitely be visiting Barcelona again!!

<Content>Location Location Loaction Located in the middle of La Ramblas and 50 metres from the Liceu metro station. Location is very central although there are theifs and drug dealers hanging around outside the hotel sometimes. But they are all over the La Ramblas. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They offered to organise football tickets and were helpful with the tours on offer. We were in a double room and paid 鈧?20 for three nights. The room was quite small but had a tv, safe, air conditioner, balcony facing the back, telephone and minibar. The bathroom was very spacious and the hotel provided toiletries, hairdryer and fresh towels everyday. The only thing is that the walls must be very thin as we could hear people talking in the middle of the night from across the hall. Continental breakfast which is served in a restaurant mext door was included in the rate which consisted of a small bread roll, a slice of ham, cheese and salami, a croissant, piece of toast, jam, butter, tea or coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice. I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Good location, noisy rooms Location of the hotel is great and our double room was clean and quite new. We paid ~130鈧?night including continental breakfast. Service was friendly. Rooms were not sound proof and expecially Saturday night was noisy. I recommend ear plugs.

<Content>Fantastic location Stayed 2 nights at this hotel and was pleasantly surprised.It was 150eruos a night.It is located on the rambla about half way in the middle which means you walk straight outside onto the rambla main street and are situated about in the middle.I found it to be very clean and professional and the staff helpfull.The breakfast included was adequate.A plate of coldmeats and a fresh roll and also a plate which has a fresh crossaint and 1piece of toast with butter and jam.You get a choice of tea or coffee.Make sure you barter for your souveniers in the nearby shops as they do come down in price.Enjoy

<Content>Great Location, Clean This hotel was in a great location, right in the centre of La Ramblas. We had a balcony over looking the quieter side. The hotel was clean and well equiped (towels, toiletries etc). Staff were friendly and helpful. No problems what so ever and would definitely stay there again. Recommended!!

<Content>In the middle of the center We booked this hotel through spainbookers for 3 nights for 鈧?100 per night for a double room. The location is perfect: in the middle of the main street Las Ramblas. There are no facilities but you do not need them. You can have breakfast in the neighbourhood (go right when you exit the hotel and walk 100 meters). The room was clean, well equiped and quited (faced to back of hotel). The staff was not that friendly, it was just okay. We will try to book this hotel again in the future.

<Content>Hotel Flor Parks Myself and my partner stayed at Flor Parks in January and while we found the hotel very clean and comfortable, unfortunately I had my handbag stolen right outside and when me and my boyfriend chased after the guy that grabbed my bag off of me, he ran down an alley way and when we tried to follow, 3 or 4 large men blocked our way and basically told us if we were to follow, we would be beaten up!Barcelona, especially on La Rambla where the hotel is located, is notorious for this kind of street crime and I would urge anyone visiting the area to be extra vigilent and take care as there are a number of gangs working on La Rambla and, unfortunately, the authorities don't seem to be very willing to help tourists that have been a victim of this crime.I reported my stolen bag to the hotel reception immediately and asked that they direct me to the nearest police station so that I could report the theft, they more or less laughed in my face and told me that the police would not be interested and unless my passport was in the bag (fortunately it was not) to forget about it.The really sad thing is that my camera was in the handbag and it contained pictures from my best friend's wedding from the weekend previous - obviously these pictures cannot be replaced.This very said incident did put a dampner on what would have been a fantastic weekend. Flor Parks is ideally located for lots of bars and restaurants plus the Barri Gothic region, Gaudi Park and La Segrada Famillia and marina. Despite this, I will not be returning to Barcelona.

<Content>Great location  In addition to great location, the rate was terriffic. It was directly on the La Rambla. Despite that, even though our room overlooked La Rambla, when you closed your window, our quaint room was totally soundproof. Very impressive!However, had problem with in room Wi-Fi, which was not complementary.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Flor Parks Hotel from 28th October to 1st November, 2004. Brilliant location in the heart of the Ramblas. Had front balcony overlooking the street, byt exceptionally quiet when windows closed. Hotel modern and very clean.Staff absolutely brilliant and very friendly, most spoke very good English, great as our Spanish is appalling. Continental breakfast served in restaurant next door, but you can also choose from cooked breakfast for a few euros. We had an excellent break and would recommend to anyone not looking to stay at the Ritz! We will definitely be going back.

<Content>Watch out! Barcelona, especially lower Ramblas, is a notoriously theft prone city. This hotel provides very limited security for its guests. We had luggage stolen from the lobby during check-in, and when we cautioned other guests being equally careless the management asked us to move out! Theft is one thing, but actiively discouraging cautiion is something else. Our best guess is that they are getting a cut, but of course can't prove a thing, We easily found better accommodations with better breakfast at a lower price just a few minutes walk away -- and with impressive security.

<Content>Wonderful Surprise! At the end of September, my husband and I were booked at the Pension Dali and after a quick look at the place we decided we would not be comfortable in that particular hotel. So we took to the streets in search of a hotel. This was not an easy task as there was a festival the weekend we were there. Well we came upon the Hotel Flor Parks- which is right on Las Ramblas. It was a nice hotel that had continental breakfast at the restaurant next door. The accommodations was very good and sitting out front at night in the seats for the restaurant gave us a perfect spot to people watch. Excellent location, be sure to give it a try but book on one of the discount sights as walking in to reserve a room can be expensive.
