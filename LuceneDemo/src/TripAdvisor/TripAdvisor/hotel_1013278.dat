<Content>Great location, large room We stayed at the Arti Hotel in Florence this summer and would highly reccommend this to any other travellers who appreciate clean rooms, great location, friendly staff. The rooms were much larger than we expected and the rooms are well equipped including wi-fi. The staff were great too and reccommended some great restaurants during our stay.

<Content>Brilliant Location, Extremely Comfortable, Excellent Hosts! We had an amazing time in Florence and not least because of this gem of a hotel. It was in the heart of Florence, with the Accademia around the corner, the Duomo at one end of the street and Leonardo Da Vinci's old school at the other. None of the major sites were more than a 10 minute walk away.It was very homely and Mario and his team did everything they possibly could to make sure our stay was as comfortable as possible, including booking tours, making reservations for restaurants and for museums allowing us to beat exhaustive queues (an absolute godsend). Nothing was ever too much to ask and everything was done to make us happy.We will miss very much returning to our cosy room at the end of a long day's sightseeing. I slept so well during our stay that I wanted to take the bed back to Brighton! If you go, make sure you take breakast on the roof terrace...just beautiful!
