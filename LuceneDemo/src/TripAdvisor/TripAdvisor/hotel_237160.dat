<Content>Couldn't fault it for the price. I stayed here with my wife for 5 nights at the beginning of the month and overall it was fantastic.On first impression when we noticed the building site next door and two of the staff having a little row with eachother as walked in, we were a bit nervous about the place to say the least. Fortunately that was where our worries ended. The guy on reception was very good humoured and warned us about leaving our baggage near the doors as apparently it's been known for people to run in and grab them (ok this was a bit worring too but we didn't see any crime while we were in Barcelona) he told us we were lucky as we were in one of the newly refurbished rooms on the 4th floor and he wasn't wrong.The room (403) had a great new bathroom with two giant shower heads in a double shower and a very nice contempory wash basin and loo. The bed was very comfortable and there was a sliding door with a narrow balcony overlooking the square outside.Be warned some of the other floors are still in mid refurb so it might not be so great if you're staying there.The hotel is 2 mins from the harbour and the aquarium and 5 mins from the beach. You can walk along the harbour front and be at the end of La Rambla in about 10 - 15 mins and it's a very pleasant stroll.Barceloneta station is 50 yards away and using the subway is so easy you can get anywhere in minutes (although walking or hiring a bike is much more fun).Opposite the hotel is a restaurant called 7 Portes which has apparently been host to Winston Churchill and Che Guevara amongst many others and it's actually pretty good value considering how good the food and service is (best to get the early or book in advance as there was a bit of a queue there every night.) As for Barcelona itself I'd recommend Park Guell and Mount Tibidabo for a really energetic day out if the weather is good. Also the cable car to Montjuic that crosses the harbour had incredible views. Book in advance for the Palau de la musica and be prepared to queue for at least an hour if you want to catch the lift up the tower in Sagrada Familia but don't miss looking around it. Oh and find the open courtyard with the geese and palm trees at the cathedral it's surreal but beautiful.Look out for the 拢12 glass of beer if you have a drink in the middle of La Rambla, Estrella is great lager but that's mad.Leave the shopping until the evening as the days are short at the moment but take an extra case for all the clothes you buy!Anyway Barcelona is awesome and you could do a lot worse than the Oasis considering it came out one of the cheapest. Enjoy.

<Content>Worst hotel ever - handbag stolen at the hotel! At the first day at the hotel, my handbag was stolen while I was in the hotel bar. This was early in the evening with almost no people in the bar. The most distrustful part is that when we said that we where guests at the hotel, my bag was returned outside the hotel lobby after 25 min, with everything there except my camera, cell phone and money. The staff at the hotel laughed at us when we told them about the theft and what happened, said it must have been an invisible man, and did not care or help us. When we said that we found this experience stressful, they became rude and started arguing with us instead of taking this seriously. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great little hotel A great little hotel in a good location. Rooms a little small as is the breakfast room. We had one of the new refurbished rooms which was modern and clean. For this price it was excellent value. Staff were friendly and helpful. For a short stay hotel so you can see the sights it is spot on!

<Content>Good location A nice enough hotel in a great location, within walking distance of Las Ramblas and the Port. The rooms were on the small side, but we were out all the time so it didn鈥檛 matter. The breakfast/bar area downstairs is quite small too, and not someplace you鈥檇 want to hang out in, but why would you, when there鈥檚 so many bars to choose from within walking distance. Breakfast was basic but fine, the rooms were clean, as were all the public areas, and the staff were friendly enough.All in all, a good choice if you鈥檙e looking for somewhere not too expensive but close to Las Ramblas.

<Content>Great location, good value I paid about 50 Euros to stay in this room and I was expecting it to be a bit shabby. The restaurant attached is nothing special, but the room and the service were good overall. This hotel was much better than I expected it to be for the price. The location is close to the subway, nightspots, the Picasso museum, the pier and a bit of a walk to Las Ramblas. The room was clean and the maids asked me every day if I wanted it cleaned (I seemed to pass them often in the hallway on my way out.) My room was a bit small, but the bathroom looked new and everything worked properly.

<Content>Great location, good price but dingy rooms - ok for short stay only The positives: 5 minutes from Estacio de Franca (direct train to airport in 30 minutes for 1.70 euros), 5 minutes from Barceloneta metro station and 5 minutes to the heart of Born and Barri Gotic (shopping and eating!). Also, friendly staff and very cheap (50 euros for a single room, including breakfast). The negatives: the rooms are dingy, the bathroom's ancient, it's pretty noisy and the breakfasts are nothing special. It worked for me, but it's not somewhere I would actively recommend.

<Content>Worst hotel I've ever stayed in... I booked a lastminute cheap trip to Barcelona last week and I accept that 'you get what you pay for' but this hotel was truly awful. Here goes...It's right to next to a big building site, which was right outside my window. There was even a construction rubbish shute running down outside my window. But as well as contending with the building noise there was noise literally all night long from other guests and from the street (rubbish collection etc). I don't expect dead silence when I'm sharing a hotel with other people and in a city but this was unbelievable - banging doors, shouting, swearing etc. The walls are paper thin so when I'd wake up at 3am it was as if my room had just been invaded! The room was very outdated in style with a pathetic excuse for a shower that flooded the whole room. The 2nd floor I was on looked like something out of a ropey 1970s hall of residence in the UK, or a prison. I guess I could have moved but I'd paid in full up front and didn't want to lose the money. I could have complained but the service on the front desk was so listless that I doubted it would make any difference at all - and perhaps my fault for not speaking good enough spanish.Bascially this hotel was so bad it was funny. The ONLY good thing was the location as it was a few minutes to the beach and right round the corner from the station where you can get a direct train from the airport so for me travelling on my own, very easy to get around.An experience, but not one I would recommend! Luckily I had such a great time in Barcelona it didn't spoil it, I'm just glad I hadn't taken my husband there with me...

<Content>its ok i stayed at this hotel a year ago, it was having work done at that time, but it was no problem. i was a bit scared about it after reading some reviews. for the star rating that it has, its really in good conditions, the rooms were very small but clean. the staff was helpfull. the breakfast was not bad and included in price. it has a central location that allows you to walk anywere, but also has the metro very close. i recomend this hotel if your on a budget, and looking for something basic but clean.

<Content>Great Value For Money! We arrived at the hotel late on a Saturday evening. Due to a reason not fully explained to us we had to stay at the near by Santa Marta Hotel for one night. The next day we arrived back at the Oasis and checked in with no problems. After reading some reviews on here we were pleasantly surprised when we saw our room. The room (which was on the 4th floor) was spacious and kept very clean by the staff. The breakfast was a continental buffet style and again no real complaints here.If there was any criticism of the hotel it would be the stag parties although I would imagine most hotels in the city suffer from this problem. Our first night in the Oasis resulted in us being awoken several times as the drunks rolled in. Luckily from Monday onwards the hotel was very peaceful.Considering the star rating and price of this hotel I really do not see any grounds for complaints. The rooms were clean, breakfast good and the hotel is in a fantastic location. We would happily stay at this hotel again (just not on weekends with the stag parties around!).

<Content>Go to Another Hotel Prior to our trip to Spain, we did our due diligence and checked out tripadvisor regarding the Hotel Oasis in Barcelona. The comments seemed to run in two extremes- glowing and bad. People liked it a lot, and had nothing but great things to report, or they did not have a good experience, which was also reported. Unfortunately, our experience fell in line with many of the experiences listed by the latter. Our RoomFor us a hotel is strictly utilitarian. Its a place to hang our hats at night. We do not book high end accommodations and we have little expectation of grand amenities. We stayed at the Oasis mid February 2008, and the room was stuffy-no just plain hot! The air conditioning did not work and a fan was already in the room. It did nothing but push the warm stale air. The room did have a window, but it opened to an air well that was capped on the roof. In order to sleep we rigged the door, so we were safe while it was ajar. This allowed for heavenly fresh air circulation. We wondered what this room would be like in the summer, uggg. Being energy conscious, the hotel had a motion sensor for the light in the hallway of the location of our room. The lights went on and off all night long. This was odd because our room was on a wing with only one other room, and it was vacant. Yep, you guessed it-a Rat!!!!BreakfastWe booked through Hotels.com, and a major selling point for the Oasis was that our booking included breakfast. If it did not, we would have gone elsewhere. We were only in Spain for two weeks and wanted to get out and see the country not hunt down restaurants for morning coffee and toast. We got our meal tickets for days one and two-no problem. We simply went to the desk and the Manager handed them to us. No talk of room number or money. The third day we went to the desk and a different clerk asked us for 8.90鈧?a piece ($24.48). All we said that breakfast was included in our package. To which he shot out of his chair and said 鈥淚 only work here, you must talk to the manager.鈥?We later had a giggle about this guy鈥檚 dramatic performance. We spoke to the manager the next morning; he crossed his arms and shook his head and said 鈥渘o鈥?then turned his back on us to do something else. We let it go, until we could take the issue up with Hotels.com, the company who took our money. Upon check out the manager tried to charge us for the first two days worth of breakfast. We told him it was included and had him look it up on Hotels himself. He let the issue go, by again folding his arms, shaking his head no, and walking away. Scary. We went on to Madrid for our second week in Spain. Our OpinionThe amount we paid for our room at the Hotel Oasis, was well in line with all of the surrounding hotels. We are not spoiled American tourists with expectations of grandeur when it comes to a room. We stay in hotels so we can see the World not a hotel, but we also do not expect to get a room too hot to sleep, see rats and experience the old bait and switch! This hotel has a great location and the property itself has potential to be really nice, with better management it could probably be a place to write home about, not a dissenting opinion on Tripadvisor.com.

<Content>A 'curate's egg' hotel. First the good points.Great location with easy access from outside Barcelona - especially by car - although the urban motorways get jammed in the rush hours. Also easy to get to most of the tourist places downtown. Good public transport - buses and Metro stop nearby.Free off-road overnight parking across the road. Meters go off at 20:00 and come on at 09:00.Great breakfast buffet spread - including delicious hot scrambled eggs! Friendly bar attached - open late. Useful vending machines with (cold) snacks and drinks.Very friendly staff - many English speakers.Now the negatives.VERY thin walls to bedrooms - not much better than cardboard. Room decoration VERY tired and in need of updating. The bathtub (in the room I had!) was really only a 'deep' shower tray. OK for me, but no use for anyone wanting to lounge in the water for an hour or so!Because of the location, it seems to be on the main route for the emergency services! They do seem to quieten them somewhat at night, but they are still audible.So, in summary, I'd say above average for services, but definitely below average for room quality.

<Content>great location PLEASANT We stayed over New Years for 2 nights and hada pleasant stay. Paid about 60 euros a night for a double roomwith breakfast. which was more than ok.Location is excellentfor either the beach ,5 mins one way , and Las Ramblas whichis approx 5 mins the other way. Hotel is basic but clean. Thebedroom we had needs upgrading and some money spent onit as was old and very dated, but ok for 2 nights.Staff at receptionwere helpful and friendly . When arriving at the airport take thetrain directly to Estacia de Franca Railway Station and whenleaving this station turn left down the street for about 2 minsthen turn left at the junction and walk about 100 metrs to thehotel. Very easy to find.Dont expect luxury but a basic and simple hotel in a good location for Barcelona

<Content>Not Bad but not great! My friend and i stayed here for 2 nights from 11 to 13 Feb.  We book a superior twin room and got a tiny room with 3 sindle beds in it. It was clean and functional but that was it. The location was good.  The downside was you could hear the people in the next room in the bathroom, you could hear EVERYTHING. If you get the chance try to get a meal at Sinatras, just off the Rambla the food was FANTASTIC!Enjoy!

<Content>Perfect location, great sangria ! I have just returned from a three day trip to Barcelona, staying two nights at this hotel, and would definitely recommend it.I would like to return to Barcelona in the future and when I do so will certainly be planning to stay in this hotel again.The location is perfect - less than a minute stroll to both the metro station and tourist bus, two minutes to a whole row of bars / cafes / restaurants and 5 minutes walk to the port.We were nervous about what our room would be like after reading some reviews on this website but we were certainly relieved when we checked into our room and it was great, no complaints at all.The reception staff were very nice and extremely helpful and there was no problem with arriving at the hotel early in the morning and leaving our suitcases in a locked store room in order that we could go out for the day and return to check in later. This was the same on check out day.There is a good bar in the hotel, also open to and used by the public. Try the jugs of sangria - lovely !!

<Content>Horrific I was booked into this hotel for 2 nights arriving on New Years eve. I neary died when I saw our room (2 adults 1 child). room dark, dirty walls, curtains hanging off window etc. I went to reception to as for upgrade saying I would be happy to pay. Was told that because it was New Years eve that there was no chance of another room in that or any other hotel. Even though we had paid for the room in advance, we left immediately and walked to Las Ramblas and went into every hotel until we managed to get a room, which we were happy to pay through the nose for. I fully intended to visit every hotel in Barcelona until we got another room rather than go back to that dump. I dont know of anybody who would have found the room we were given in the Oasis acceptable. I cannot say enough about this hotel except stay away.

<Content>Wish I liked it better, but alas, it was just adequate.... The price was dirt cheap (about $60 per night including breakfast for two) per night for our 5 night stay. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. While our room was badly needing a re-do, it was clean. The location is it's best selling point. You really can walk to most everything of interest. Metro stop is next door, Estacio de Franca is around the corner and the Marinas are just up the street (but not the cruise port - it's a short cab ride away).A few of the staff are down right surly, but the few that shine make it tolerable. It is a very noisy place.Don't expect english on the TV - just CNN and maybe a sports channel.Bottom line - it's fine for one or two nights, but if you're staying longer, find something a little nicer that you can look forward to returning to at the end of a long day of touring the city.The following has nothing to do with the hotel:A final warning about Barcelona - BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS! One night while on la Rambla a group of young asian girls approached and surrounded us offering us sex, all the while passing their hands over you looking for your wallet. Managed to escape that attempt only to get stung the next day. While in a small square where cafe tables were set up for a couple of restaurants, a guy approached and said something was all over the back of my jacket and pants. From what I could see it looked like vomit (or worse) and when he offered to wash it off (in the restroom of the restaurant) I let him lead me there. While brushing whaterver it was, he was expertly checking all the usual spots where tourists think they can cleverly hide their wallets from crooks. My wallet was in a zipped pockets in the lining of my jacket. Within 2 minutes of his departure I realized my wallet was lone gone and so was the crook. It took me about 15 minutes to walk to the police station and the very first thing they had me do was to call the credit card companies. In just that short period of time, the crook had managed to charge over $1,000 to one of my cards!!!A little advice.....Keep a record of your credit card numbers in a seperate place.DON'T carry your social security card! - EVER!Keep a photo copy of all your documents in a seperate bag on let your travel partner carry them.

<Content>Holes Everywhere Location:Not located in the old city. About 10 min walk to the Las Rambla, the launching pad for most travelers. Metro station is about 3 minute walk from hotel. Also, there are a bit of things to see and do around the hotel-the Barceloneta and the Port areas. Overall, the location is great. The room:It was a mixed bag. I got an old room. It was really bad. There were holes everywhere; on the wall, the floor, the ceiling. Since I had a single room, it was understandably smaller than usual double. Because of the poor lay out of the room, it was really dark. Say, during the daytime, if you were to read something, you would have to have the light turned on. The walls were very dirty looking. The bathroom was very small. There was mildew everywhere on the shower stall. The door was also very thin therefore I heard everything when someone talking in the hallway. Unfortunately, there other young travelers, it got very loud. The room was very appalling. Granted that it was a two star establishment, it really was beyond my belief when I first saw it. However, the common areas, such as the breakfast room and the reception area, were very nice. Those were recently renovated. I suspect that renovated rooms would be in much better shape. Service:The folks at front desk were always nice and friendly for the most part. The same can be said about folks at the breakfast buffet. Regarding the breakfast buffet, choices were very limited. I had toast and jam everyday. There were hard-boiled eggs. There was also salad, something I thought was rather odd. Salad for breakfast? There were cold cuts. However, there was no fruit of any kind. The OJ was very diluted. I think it was just water and some yellow color they put in. Recommendation:I would not recommend this place unless you know for sure that you will get recently renovated room. I paid about 55 euros per night for a single, which I think was neither excessive nor cheap.

<Content>Not impressed with the management My friend and I have just got back from staying at the Oasis. I'll start with the plus points:Great location, local to many amenities, only 10 minutes walk from Las Ramblas and about 2 minutes from the start of the harbour.Price includes a cold buffet, which although basic was an advantage.Minus points:I paid for a 'superior' room and got what I woul describe as a basic room, although it was clean.Horrendously noisy Italians staying on the same floor who had absolutely no consideration for other guests and who decided to start arguments with each other , play fight in the corridors and come in from their night out at all times, whilst screaming at each other down the corridor. We requested the management to speak to the Italians concerned, but they just called the room to tell them to be quiet which worked for all of a nanosecond. Also when we asked to be moved the following day, we were told there were no rooms available , although we had been told the night before that there would be, as there were guests checking out. My friend is pregnant and so needs her sleep, but nothing seemed to change the mind of the management to allow us to move. Their attitude was that they had our money and hard luck! They said they would speak to those concerned, but it made not one blind bit of difference as they were just as bad if not worse on the second night, despite being asked to be quiet, which completly spoilt our stay. My friend was very ill on our final day due to lack of sleep and stress. I would not stay at this hotel again, due to the attitude of the management - shameful that they showed such little respect for their guests.

<Content>Brilliant! This hotel is such good value for money.I went with my girlfriend in Nov 2007. The hotel is in a brilliant location, there was no need to use the metro even though the station is 2mins walk down the road! The Bus touristic stop is located on the square where the hotel is - I definately advise anyone to take the tour! Port Vell is very close and has superb restaurants by the harbour.Even in November the city was bustling with locals and tourists.The receptionists were all very willing to help and booked us restaurant reservations on two occations and a taxi to the airport.The breakfast buffet is pleasant and will suit anyones tastes!Finally I strongly recommend a guide book just to give you a background knowledge of the nice restaurants in the area or you could ask the receptionists where they recommend! I used the AA barcelona city pack which was great!Hope this helps,Enjoy!

<Content>Good hotel, great location Stayed here for a few nights in November 2006.This hotel is a 10 min walk from barcelone city centre ( christopher columbus statue ). It is also a 20 min walk from the beach.Hotel was clean, with friendly staff. Language was not a problem.The breakfast was cereal, croissants, toast, coffee/tea.Funny that the breakfast waiter acts like Basil Fawlty from fawlty towers.Bescide the hotel there was a building site. Noise didnt start untail 8am, and finished by 5pm. That was in november 2006.The metro stop is only 2 mins walk away.The tourist sightseeing bus passes right in front of the hotel.Nov. temp. is 16c on average.Barcelona is a beautifull and underrated city.Better than Rome and Milan.

<Content>renovated or not..... My husband and I booked a trip to barcelona which included flight and accomodation. Originally we were going to just book our flight and wing the accomodation. Its a good thing we did not because Aug is prime season and there are no vacancies anywhere in Barcelona (if you dont like millions of tourists then avoid Barcelona in Aug). When trying to decide on where to stay we looked at reviews on tripadvisor. Hotel Oasis got mixed reviews and we decided to take a chance. When we arrived we realised why there were mixed reviews, half the hotel is renovated and the other half is a glorified hostel. The hotel fails to mentiont that in their website and when booking. Unfortunately we got the glorified hostel which was clean, specially the bathroom but overall the room was very rundown. Our bed we beyond uncomfortable and we complained to the hotel. The hotel was fully booked and there was no way to move rooms. After 3 days we moved to the renovated area at no extra cost. The front desk was very understanding and helpful. The breakfast was very basic but had variety (breads, cheeses, hardboiled eggs, cereals,fruit etc) and kept us full. The location was really awesome, 10min walk to La Rambla and the beach. Barcelona is a very big city and we highly recommend renting bikes and doing a bike tour. The Spanish cuisine is nothing to brag about but if you stay off main streets (specially La Rambla), you can find a decent meal. We also recommend going to cities outside Barcelona like Girona and Figueres.

<Content>Old versus refurbished I'm surprised by some of the recent reviews here but I guess it depends on which part of the hotel you're in. My friend  I stayed here recently and booked via different websites; I was on a refurbished floor but she wasn't. My room was a twin whilst hers was a small single even though we both paid similar amounts (although breakfast wasn't included in mine). So I suppose it's best to check what you're getting when you book because they were quite different. My room seemed clean and well presented, especially for a two star hotel. The shower and TV both worked well (always a good sign!). Other facilities were okay: there was aircon  a hairdryer but no mini-bar/fridge to store cold drinks in, no kettle, no room safe, no room service. The receptionist we dealt with was very helpful. And the staff at breakfast seemed very on top of things - the buffet (8 EUR) was well supplied with cereals, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, pastries, rolls, etc. A good start to the day!The hotel location was excellent, just 5-10 mins walk from the train station, near La Ramblas and also near the beach  marina.

<Content>Scabbies As we arrived at the Oasis the staff was pleasent and helpful. Our room was small but seemed clean. There was paint missing and black marks on all the walls. When we returned from sight seeing our air conmditioner wasn't working. We told the front desk about it and they said they would send someone up to fix it because they didn't have any other rooms available for us to switch to. They never came to check on our unit. It began working again on its own later in the night. We stayed at the Oasis for 2 nights. When we awoke the second morning we noticed small red marks on our arms that itched. A week later when we finished our trip the spots had developed into large bumps over our entire bodies. When we returned home and saw our doctor he told us we had gotten scabbies from the bed. I am pregnant and cannot use to insecticide cream to remedy the bugs living under my skin. I will have to live with this condition for the next 8 months. My husband will also, because even if he uses the cream, I will continue to reinfect him. Obviously, we will never recommend this hotel to anyone or stay there again ourselves.

<Content>Smelly and humid. Booked at hotelclub.com without problems. But the room I got was smelly and very very humid. It only had one tiny window to the inside of the building (very narrow) which means not very airy. There was an air conditioner but it smelled even worse than the room itself. I even saw a bug in the room (I didn't care much... i tried not to think what was in the bed because of all that humidity). The bathrooom seemed clean (at least better than the room). The water pressure was a bit low but anyway...  I had an inconvenience with a staff member (the african-spanish one) who was very rude towards me. When I returned to the hotel and I wished to lift the key he yelled very impolitely at me saying: What do you want?!. After I told him I wished a key he became a bit more friendly. It might be because I was a bit sweating since I had been hurrying back to the hotel (and it was hot outside)... The other two receptionists were very nice and polite. A breakfast was ok to me. Cold food though (ham, hard-boiled eggs, cheese, croissants and stuff like that), self service. The location is quite good. Somewhere between the Ramblas and the beach. It must be about 10-15 minutes walk from the Ramblas. And also about 15 minutes to the beach. The neighborhood seemed safe. So to conclude, I only spent like 4 hours in the room (including sleeping) so all those things didn't bother me much. But still, it was not a very nice experience and a hostal I stayed in some days before (near the Saints station, for half the price of Oasis) was much cleaner and nicer. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and I certainly will not go there again although it is quite cheap.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, just what we needed We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Oasis and can highly recommend this hotel. It is a 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas along the port front. It is very clean, has nice rooms (we stayed in a confort room) with good bathroom and bed. one slight problem was noisy neighbours who has no consideration for others, we could hear them 3 doors away.Apart from this an excellent stay. We booked with alpharooms.com and got a great deal.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Great location This hotel has been recently refurbished. It is in a great location, just round the corner from the last stop of the Airport train line. 10 minutes walk to Las Ramblas and 10 minutes to the beach. The Marina is just across the road. I was travelling alone and tend to look towards the cheaper hotels. I was very impressed with this hotel and would not hesitate to return with my family (the ZOO is 5 minutes walk away). The room I stayed in was clean and tidy, a typical functional hotel room TV, bathroom etc. Breakfast was included and a good choice of food was provided. Altogether a bargain at about 拢32 per night. Would recommend to anyone.

<Content>Great location and value We stayed only one night at the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised that this was indeed a two star hotel (maybe even better). Most of the time, I feel I want to take a star away from hotels, but this one is a good two star. Location is great, minutes from the Gothic Quarter or 10-15 min. walk from the beaches. Staff was helpful and friendly. Rooms clean and basic. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Ideal location - shame about the noise We stayed at this hotel in the first week of April. It was clean and the room recently redecorated. The staff were helpful and the breakfast which was part of the cost was more than adequate. The main downside was the small room and the fact that there is major redevelopment next door on what looks like a metro/railway extension - definitely not short-term! Being woken by the heavy machinery at the crack of dawn may not appeal to those who yearn for a peaceful sleep-in. The upside is the fact that it is close to the major attractions, next to the railway station which has regular trains to the airport and next to the metro. In the summer, it is close to the beach and would provide some nice walks.

<Content>central hotel Stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. The reception area is now finished and is an attractive area. The hotel is very well situated for all the sights and attractions that Barcelona has to offer. The breakfast had plenty of choice the only thing lacking was no fruit option. The room we stayed in was basic but for the cost it is what we expected,the downside would be the noise through the walls as you can hear everything in the adjoining rooms. Overall you get a basic central hotel.

<Content>Way too noisy We booked the cheaper rooms for this hotel, so did not expect too much, however the room was very small with a tiny window, but the worst was the noise. You could hear everything that went on around you in neighbouring rooms, the TV, the taps being turned on, the shower. Worst still, this hotel does attract those who like to stay out very late so expect to be rudely awaken by druken revellers talking in corridors and trying to get back into their rooms. Sound travels extremely well in this hotel. For someone who likes a good nights sleep this hotel is not for me.

<Content>Pleasant Enough But... The review title says it all....pleasant enough Hotel in a good location, just a short walk around the corner from Estacio De Franca Station which is very accessable from the Airport. We tried to take a taxi from the Station to the Hotel but the driver refused to take us and very kindly just provided us with directions as it was such a short walk to the Hotel.First impression of Hotel not great due to the refurbishment of the Reception Area but once having arrived at the ad hoc reception we met with very nice helpful people as we did at every breakfast (the staff at breakfast made for a very good atmosphere to set you up for the day...laughing  joking between themselves). Accomodation was clean, tidy, comfortable for a 3 night stay but with no frills and fancies.Dislikes amounted to:- 1. No Fresh Fruit or Cooked Fare available at breakfast .2. Adjoining Bar Area closed at 11.00 pm and did not appear to  be part of the Hotel Complex.No worries if your check out time is prior to leaving for your flight /journey home or onwards as a secure area is provided by the Hotel.Buenos dias..buenos tardes...buenos noches - whatever time of day you may read this (Enjoy Barcelona - it is awesome!!!!)Warning from two travellers.... A lot of Barcleona Tourist Sites seem to be CLOSED on Mondays.

<Content>Excellent for weekend breaks After landing late at night at Girona, We got the late bus into the bus station in Barcelona, this takes about 45 mins. We then got a taxi to the hotel for a couple of euros. The hotel reception is being re-done so the reception was a small desk, how ever we were greeted by friendly staff and got our room no problems, The room was clean, new, and very satisfactor, We didn't have a view but that didn't bother us as there was so much to see outside the hotel. The hotel is more or less central, 5 mins to the port and to the main La Rambles strip. The breakfast was so nice! Continental but evereything you could think of and as much as you like. Would definatly reccomend this hotel and go myself again. We paid about 拢20 per night for the room, definatly worth it.

<Content>Convenient Location If you are just after a place to sleep at the cheaper end of Hotels in Barcelona, this is a great location. Just around the corner from the train station that links to the airport (is end of the line) made arriving and departing on first visit to the city so easy. Also, is an easy walk into the old town, marina and other places.

<Content>Nice hotel, despite the problems! Despite the excellent reviews this hotel has had, I had to give it a lower rating because we had some problems. There were some downsides as well as upsides to our stay in this hotel. The downsides were:- When we arrived to the hotel the entire reception area was being renovated and looked like a building site - not a good first impression- Our room looked out onto what can be best described as a tiny, enclosed inner courtyard so we had very little daylight and fresh air- We had no hot water for the first day, which we were told was due to some work being carried out on the gas pipes in the street- On the second day of our stay we were woken up by incredibly noisy building work at 8:30 in the morning! On the upside:- The rooms were clean, nicely furnished and comfortable- The staff were friendly and helpful and when we eventually complained we were given a new room, which looked out onto the street and was thus light, airy, quiet and had hot water!- The breakfasts were abundant and tasty- The location is ideal! Not only is the hotel 10 mins walk away from La Rambla but its also less than 5 mins walk away from the train station (Estacio dela Franca) which has excelent links to the airportIn summary, I think we were a little unlucky, and if you were to go at a different time, when there are no building works or problems with hot water, you would have a very pleasant stay.

<Content>Superb hotel in a fantastic location Stayed at the Oasis Hotel with 3 friends in March 2006. The location of the hotel is superb, right on the edge of the Barrio Gotic, and just across the street from the marina. It's a 10 minute walk to La Rambla and the same to the beach. Metro and bus lines are very close to the hotel, the Metro is so easy to use I can't describe it to you! The hotel was clean and comfortable. Rooms were a decent size and secure. Bathroom was immaculate and the beds were comfortable. Buffet breakfast was excellent and there was plenty to choose from. The staff spoke English and were very friendly and organised; we had tickets to a BArca game delivered to the hotel and they were there at reception waiting for us when we arrived.I highly recommend this hotel and challenge anyone to pick faults with it. The next time we go, we will be staying here without a doubt.

<Content>great location We arrived late at night at Girona Airport in November. we took the bus to barcelona station. a taxi cost us 10euros, which we knew was a rip off but were too tired to argue!! we were greeted at the temporary reception by two very polite and helpful gentlemen who spoke very good english. the next day the receptionist took great delight in offering advice when we asked for directions and as a result we hadsome amazing experiences we would not have known about otherwise!!the room was clean and comfy. we had a top floor room and the view was wonderful from the window! the staff at breakfast were pleasant and always helpful. we spent most of our time out of the hotel obviously!! there was an irish bar round thecorner from the hotel and the marina was a few minutes walk away. the metro was just at the end of the street and the beach was only 5 minues away. fantastic location, wonderful staff. i am already planning our next visit! Although be warned, this is not a 4star hotel, do not expect Hilton standards!! if you are looking for a comfortable, well appointed hotel for a short break this is perfect.

<Content>Lovely clean hotel We loved the location of this hotel. We took a taxi from the airport as we were not sure where we were going and it cost about 30euros but we found the train station just around the corner so we found out it would cost about 5euros when we were going back. A basic hotel but very clean and friendly staff. The breakfast was very good, you could eat as much as you liked. We will definately go back to the Oasis.

<Content>Oasis confort-excellent location Stayed at the Confort rooms in this Hotel on a weekend break. It was very clean and the breakfast was fine. There was some refurbishment going on so there was only a makeshift reception, however despite that the receptionist was very friendly and effiicient. The Barceloneta metro was just around the corner and the tourist bus (blue Line) stopped across the square from the hotel. You are just walking distance from Port Vale and the marina. Only comment I have about our room was that it was just above the main door and the sound of traffic was very noisy. I would ask to move if allocated a room first floor at the front.

<Content>should be a three star!! This hotel was alot better than an average 2 star hotel. I went with my friend and am usually quite fussy when it comes to places to stay but i loved it. It was not dirty at all and the location was fab. If you are going for a fun weekend in Barcelona, stay at the Oasis!!!!!

<Content>Excellent value We have just returned after spending 4 nights at the Oasis. We booked a confort room and we wern't disappointed. The room was clean and spacious with 3 single beds a telly and plenty of closet space. The bathroom was adequate and shower was ok although the bath was a tad small, but who has time for a bath on a city break. The breakfast was buffet style with plenty of choice, but anyone wanting a full english should book elsewhere. The dining room is quite small and busy but we never had to wait for a table, more through luck than judgement.The staff are friendly but dont speak much english, but why should they, they're Spanish. We had to call reception after our key card conked out but this was dealt with straight away without any fuss, although we hadnt a clue what the maintanence man was saying.The location was a major factor in us choosing the Oasis as well as the price. Its approx. 10-15 mins walk down the prom. from la Rambles. We didnt spend that much time in the hotel and its not the best looking from the outside, but if your on a budget and want an ideal location this hotel is for you. I would have no hesitation recomending this hotel to my friends.

<Content>Excellent value brillian location We have stayed at the Oasis on numerous ocassions. Every time we have stayed here we have never had a bad experience. check in has always been easy, the staff more than helpful. the breakfast is what you expect for the price you pay. The rooms have always been clean. Would recommend this hotel to anyone who really wants to enjoy what Barcelona has to offer. Lets be real this city has so much and who wants to stay in their room when there's so much to see and do. The location of this hotel is superb and the ramblas just a short walk away and the port on your doorstep. STAY HERE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT IT IS REAL VALUE FOR MONEY.

<Content>Really Dirty Standard Rooms We Stayed in a Standard Room. Maybe The Confort Rooms are better, from outside they look better. We could hear everything inthat dirty smell Room. In the middle of the night we woke up because WE heard a couple doing love but really loud it sounded they were in our room also all the people passed by our room were so loud. Don麓t take kids to this hotel. There was blood on wall and dirt everywhere in the room also the room is really small. The breakfast doesn麓t taste at all. We wanted tochange the room but tehn they toldus thehotelwas full, sure. Really we usually not complain so much but this hotel sucks. The area is ok but the Ramblas are a little bit far away . If You really want to come get a confort room. THE STAFF IS NOT FRIENDLY EITHER.

<Content>Fine for a couple of nights Don't expect the Ritz and you won't be disappointed. Considering the location (which is excellent) in comparison to the price, its not surprising the Oasis lacks somewhat in luxuries. The rooms are small, the bath is tiny and the balcony is more like a ledge but they are clean and fine for a couple of nights if you are not planning on spending much time there during the day. The male receptionist is fantastic and the staff very helpful. Breakfast was very good and the hotel bar very nice with reasonable prices. I would certainly recommend it for a budget city break.

<Content>Perfect Budget Accomodation If you want a cheap but clean hotel room in a fantastic location - this will be perfect for you. Dont make the mistake of expecting all the trimmings that go with a 5* hotel and you wont be disappointed.Rooms are very basic yet comfortable and clean - enough for you to get a decent nights kip. Breakfasts are simple and filling.Location is ideal with the main attractions including the Ramblas only 10 mins walk away. Tube and bus stations only a 1 minute walk away.Would recommend to anyone wishing for a good comfortable base to see Barcelona from on a budget.

<Content>great value for money Don't forget this is only a two star hotel. We had a standard room which was on the small side but everything was clean and tidy. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom had no mould or damp problem even though there was no extractor fan. You can't fault the location of this hotel..just minutes from alot of attractions or close to transport stops. If you want a full english for breakfast you will be disappointed, but we enjoyed the cold buffet. I wouldn't recommend thid hotel for a romantic weekend but if you are looking for a place to crash in between sightseeing and partying this is well worth staying at.

<Content>Super cold room We arrive and stay in a comfort room(521) on the 5th floor by the corner from 23 to 26 Nov 2005. The location was great as it is near the port veil, ramblas and everywhere. Breakfast was OK nothing fanciful with jam, bread and ham.One big minus point, it was very cold(5 - 7 degree) during Nov and the heater was not working properly and the lousy windows could not keep out the cold air coming in. My wife and I had to use a double blanket and sleep very close together to keep each other warm through out the 3 nights.Imagine even after complaining about heater, the reception told us the heater system serves the whole hotel so it should be working fine. I realise later that the real problem could be the 2 big windows(facing the main road) that is leting in the cold air with the big gaps on them.If possible I would not stay with them again unless they fixed their lousy heating system and the windows.

<Content>IT IS NOT DISGUSTING! I was worried about staying here due to a couple of scary reviews! However, although it wasn't great it certainly wasn't disgusting! We wanted a confort room but these were all booked up, even the corridors to the confort rooms were nicer than the standard room corridors! The triple standard room was poky and the view was very disappointing to say the least! However the room was very clean and this is important! The breakfast was rubbish - much preferable to go to a nearby local pastry/coffee shop. The location was good and the staff helpful. So, if you are thinking of booking, definitely get a confort room, if you have booked and couldn't get one, don't worry, it is not disgusting, but don't expect the Ritz!

<Content>excellent location A double 'confort' room at the Hotel Oasis, Barcelona, was good value, clean and extremely well positioned for a short break in the city. Breakfast was adequate and sufficiently filling to make lunch a cheap option. Visit the Cathedrals, Olympic Village and the Nou Camp. If you want to watch a match the Champions League fixture cost 29 euros for a real Bird's Eye view. If you can't stand heights then it does get more expensive. Try not to take a car into the City. Traffic is usually congested and the Metro and Tourist buses offer a reasonable alternative for a small cost. If you don't want to use your car it will cost at least 19 euros per day for off street parking (and possibly more). If I go back I may well use the Oasis again but will not be taking a car!

<Content>Could not fault it Stayed at the Hotel Oasis in Barcelona for two nights in October. We had a triple room on the fifth floor, the room was spacious, very clean and quiet. The staff were helpful and pleasant, the breakfast room was also clean and the breakfast for a 2* hotel was very good. The location of the hotel was perfect, the tour buses stopped just down the road, it was an easy walk along by the marina to the statue of Christopher Columbus (about 10 min) and from there straight up the Ramblas. We had an excellent stay and would certainly stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Something positive! My sister and I booked this hotel through Easyjet and only read the past reviews in the weeks before we left. So it was with much trepidation that we entered the hotel on 20/10/05 for our three night stay. The entrance and reception are of a high standard and we were served by a very polite and friendly receptionist. Luckily we had been allocated a confort room and have no complaints whatsoever. It was spacious, clean and all that we needed for our stay. All the staff we came into contact with were polite and friendly. I had used a folded blanket as I need more than one pillow and the next day the chambermaid must have figured I needed a second one and had provided one without my even asking, i think that is great service. It is in a fantastic location close to Metro, train and the tourist buses (highly recommended for seeing the city). It's a city that never sleeps so there is constant traffic noise and sirens but only to be expected in a city centre hotel, we found the windows were sufficient to dull the noise and we slept very well. I think as long as you ensure you get a confort room you will not be disappointed with this hotel.It was our first trip to Barcelona and we fell in love with the city, highly recommended you go there and give The Oasis a go!

<Content>Great location, ok hotel Myself and my husband stayed there for 3 nights from Friday to Monday. Hotel easy to find, reception efficient. Room very small but clean, bathroom small no shower gel or shampoo supplied. Breakfast not good - cheap watery orange juice, rolls and margarine not butter, cold meats and plain yogurts, you could eat elsewhere as breakfasts were very cheap in local cafes. Location excellent, right beside the stop for the bus turistic and very close to the barri gothic and the port veill, about 5/6 minutes to las ramblas. No trouble with pickpockets but did keep tight hold of our possessions. Lots of nice restaurants around and great shopping

<Content>please don`t go there!!! It is disgusting We stayed at this hotel for one night. It is the worst hotel (if you could call it like this, it is worse than a hostel) that i have ever been. The room that we got had almost no natural light and it was extremely dirty. If you are claustrophobic it would be a problem, because the room was a matchbox (max 8 m2). The smell in the room was also terrible, a mixture of fried food and cigarette smell and the staff was very unfriendly. The breakfast was simple and not good, i would not recomend, you better eat anywhere else. The next day we leaved the hotel and found an one star hotel just around the corner that was half of the price and much better.WARNING: do not book a room in Oasis!!!

<Content>No Problems just back from a brilliant short break staying at hotel oasis. Have to admit about being a bit worried about previous posts, but if you've already booked, and are now panicing- please don't.we were in a superior room, which was clean and spacious. The staff were always friendly and the location really fantastic - 5 mins to zoo, 5 mins to marina area with aquarium and IMAX and 10 min walk to La Rambla. There are also 2 very close stops for the open top bus tour.Breakfast was nice- plenty of choice and in ample supply. Well above average for a 2 star hotel. Would gladly stay again.

<Content>YUK!!! We are an Italian family of 4 and we booked for this hotel using Alpitour in Italy.Well, when we arrived there and got into the room we saw a huge black bug crossing the room.I was horrified and we obviously called the tour operator in Italy that understood the situation and let us change the hotel.That would certainly have ruined our holiday...Keep out of this horrible hotel

We told the fact to the receptionist and to his principal but they didn't do nothing and said that we were culpable of leaving the money in the room...Incredible!!!Going out all the people gave the magnetic card of their room to the recepstionist and trusts him; besides us who could enter in the room with magnetic card???Try to give an answer.....

<Content>Great for a few days Stayed at the Oasis for 2 night in December, pleasantly surprised by the weather. Location - 10 minutes walk from La Ramblas main shopping street but Hotel is right next door to the train station which is a plus for getting to/from the Airport.Breakfast wasn't up to much, ham, cheese, rolls etc but thats not the end of the world.All in all, for a cheap few nights away, i'd stay here again.

<Content>Cheap and cheerful. Stayed for 4 nights in the Oasis hotel in June. A basic hotel that was fairly clean. Rooms were pretty small and really needed redecorating, but were adequate for a place to stay. The breakfast was simple, but enough to set you on your way. Looks as if they are refurbishing the hotel and I am sure that once complete, this hotel will be easily worthy of a 3 star rating. It was well placed - just a five minute walk from the beach, the Harbour and about 10 minutes to La Ramblas. Barcelona was a great place to visit. saw everything the two of us needed to in the time we were there and really enjoyed our stay. enjoy.

<Content>Great Location and Hotel Myself and my partner recently stayed in the Hotel on a four night break in July. We found the location to be great with the beach only a 5 minute walk away and the Las Ramblas area really close as well - about 5-10 minute walk, didn't need a taxi the whole time we were there. We were a bit concerned after reading some of the other reviews about this Hotel but we were in a comfort room which was brand new and clean, the room had air-con, and was also very quiet. The breakfast was also good and staff were helpful. Would definitely recommend this Hotel and stay here again as for the price and location you won't get any better.

<Content>You get what you pay for! We stayed here for two nights over the first weekend in July. Three of us shared a triple room and paid 拢50 each for 2 nights BB. After reading the reviews on this site, it would appear that soime of the hotel rooms are refurbished and some arent - ours wasn't. The room was small and basic, but the bed linen, towels, bath and sink were clean. The bathroom floor looked clean but had a squashed cockroach in the corner so obviously hadn't been mopped. The beds were comfortable, the TV worked, if you could be bothered the fiddle on with it, and the air con worked, although it did make a buzzing sound every now and again. Breakfast was ok - toast, bread rolls, croissants, ham, salami, cheese, cornflakes, fruit and yogurt - and the breakfast area and bar are nicely decorated and clean. The staff on reception are polite enough but not very helpful and a couple ofthem spoke poor english.All in all this hotel was ok - for 拢25 a night I couldn't complain. If all you're after is somewhere to sleep with a shower that works, then this is the place. If you want anything more than that, don't bother staying here.

<Content>At least the location is good! Stayed at the Oasis for 4 nights. I agree with the previous reviewer about Octopus Travel - they provide very flattering photos of this hotel.The hotel was being refurbished but we were given an old room which was filthy and worn. The hotel staff said the refurbished rooms were all booked even though we booked the hotel 5 months previous and never saw more than half a dozen other guests in the hotel.The room had the smallest window I've ever seen (with a view of the neighbouring wall), we had the opposite problem with the radiator in the fact that it wouldn't turn off, so the heat in the room was unbearable! (Don't expect air conditioning)Our room was next to the elavator - the noise of the elavator throughout the night was like a pneumatic drill in the head, then the cleaners started hoovering at around 6.30am. Nice. The hotel staff were completely uninterested in any problems - we even spoke to the hotel manager who told us to contact Octopus Travel as he held no responsibility (!), and when we contacted Octopus Travel, guess what - we were told to complain to the hotel manager.A filthy hell-hole, I would pay a lot extra to stay at a better hotel next time, as Barcelona is a great city. The location's not bad though.

<Content>Has some problems Stayed for one night in a regular room in May. The location of the hotel was good and the included breakfast was OK too. However, if you book here make sure you reserve their confort room. We tried unsuccessfully to upgrade and were very disappointed in our room. The room was very plain, tile floors, basic linens but the bathroom was unpleasant with a sink that did not drain and old and worn fixtures. I would only stay here again if I could reserve one of their better rooms. Also, beware the subway in the area - we experienced a couple of pickpocketing attempts.

<Content>Enjoyable City Break We spent a four day city break, Mon 2nd till Thurs 5th May and stayed at the Oasis Hotel. After reading two of the previous reviews for April I was very worried about this booking as my 70 year old (though fairly fit) sister was accompanying my husband and myself.However we were pleasantly surprised when we got to our rooms. Our double room (third floor) was quite small but very clean and comfortable with air con (which did work if you tried) TV, phone, nice bathroom with hair dryer and large make up mirror, soap, shampoo. Plenty of clean white towels.Our bed was clean and comfortable. My sister was on the floor below and her twin room was larger and she had absolutely no complaints considering what we had paid for the trip.We had been informed that there was an ongoing refurbishment programme and the lift would not be in use. However the service lift would be in operation, hence my sister being on a lower floor.Our rooms were the Superior or Comfort rooms and had obviously been newly refurbished. Not sure if the intention is to refurbish and upgrade all the hotel rooms. I think it would be a good idea as the only complaint we had was that there was no safety deposit box ( we left our money and passports in the Reception safe) and we would have liked a brighter bedside lamp for reading at night.Breakfast was the usual continental type breakfast which we thought was adequate and there was also a tapas/bar and restuarant. We ate out but did have a couple of drinks each night in the bar.This hotel is only about a ten minute stroll from La Ramblas and lots of other attractions and right next door to the metro. The railway station is also round the corner though we didn't realise this till later and took a taxi from the airport. About 23 euros, so split three ways was far easier way to get direct to your hotel.Walls probably are quite thin but I think this is the same in most 2/3 star hotels, certainly the ones we have stayed in in Paris and Amsterdam. The only noise we heard was the cleaner in the morning which we didn't have a problem with as it was about time to get up anyway and also the noise of running water from toilet and showers above and below. First morning I did think it was water running down the wall but after that didn't really notice it.All in all we had a wonderful break with lovely warm weather. For a 2 star hotel we were very happy with the standard and location of the hotel. All the staff were fine and tried to be helpful. We would have no hestitation in staying at the Oasis again if/when we go back to Barcelona.

<Content>Not Awful - would definately stay again This hotel definately isn't the nicest hotel we came across while visiting Barcelona, but was far from the worst. It seemed that we either came across REALLY nice hotels (which were also very expensive) or REALLY gross hotels (which were really cheap) - Hotel Oasis was one of the only hotels we came across which was somewhere in the middle. It was perfect for my friend and I who did not want to spend a fortune on a room but wanted it to be at least decent.You get a good price for the area, with an incredible location, right next to a metro, 5 minute walk from the beach, perfect distance from las ramblas... The breakfast buffet they have was okay - nothing special though. The rooms were pretty tiny but clean. Just a warning - they are in the process of doing a lot of work on the hotel now - so there is a lot of contruction going on - but it did not really bother us. If you plan to be in the room during the day and like quiet - you may want to keep this in mind. One more thing to note - the room with a balcony isnt really a balcony - we had trouble getting the window open to be honest.The one thing we really were not happy about, was that our phone had been torn out of the wall and was just sitting on the nightstand broken. We asked several times for this to be fixed and nothing was ever done about it. Our wake up call in the morning became a wake up pound on the door. When we went downstairs to ask to use their phone at one point to make a local call - we were told no. We were pretty angry about that...Overall, I would stay here again. For someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a room, but is not up to braving a hostel - this hotel is a good choice. You aren't going to get the top of the line service, but you don't pay for it either.

<Content>Don't stay here - it's awful What a disappointment. Paid over the odds for a tiny, unclean room. Bath was tiny, bathroom needed a good scrub. Room was only big enough for the bed and not much else. We had a room on the second floor, slightly noisy but hotel was empty when we stayed - I'd dread to thinkl what it would be like if the hotel was full!Breakfast was a joke, staff reasonable.You can get nice 4* hotels for teh same price we paid for this hell-hole.

<Content>when shall we go back? We stayed at the Oasis in Aug 04, for 5 nights. As we payed next to nothing we expected it to be very much on the basic side, and in my head I had prepared myself for the worst. Far from it. The hotel looks nicer in the flesh (pardon that expression) than in any brochure and was clean and well located. The room was exeptionally small and very basic, with just the bed a tiny table and a tv to boast, but it was all that was needed. It did feel a bit cell-like at times as the corridors echo'ed any sounds all around the hotel, and you could quite clearly hear next doors conversation (or worse) in the room. The surrounding areas of the hotel aren't as pretty as some parts of the city, more functional than aesthetic but the hotel is right by a major train station and Barceloneta metro station for fantastic travel links, there are also very frequent buses to the centre which takes a couple of minutes if you cannot be bothered to walk. Do not be put off by the homeless outside the hotel in the park, its a fact of life around barcelona I'm afraid, they will not harm you or approach you.Look out for the man on reception, he is so miserable it is untrue, very funny indeed but he was not at all rude.Brilliant hotel!

<Content>NOISE NEED NOT BE A PROBLEM I stayed at this hotel, and after reading some of the reviews, I was very suprised to find this hotel to be a nice and pleasent place to stay. I stayed with my partner, in a superier room. We were on the top (5th) floor, so traffic noise with double glazing was not a problem. We stayed between 21st Feb - 25th, and Chesea FC were playing Baca on the 23rd. When some drunk guys came back to the hotel at 3am making a noise, I 'phoned down to reception to complain. The situation was dealt with straight away by the staff (I go to a hotel to sleep)! So don't just lie in bed moaning, do something!Most of the referb is complete, with most of the work being near the lift (never a good idea to stay by a lift in any hotel).Breakfast was a good, for the price, with plenty of choice. Boiled eggs, rolls, three meats, cheese, cornflakes, yoghurt, jam, fruit, toast, juice, coffee, tea, herbal teas etc etc.Great location, close to metro, walking distance to most places of interest.I found the staff at this hotel to be pleasent and helpful, and did not encounter the rude receptionist!We payed 拢42.75 which for Barcelona is a real bargain, from Midas Hotelnetwork.I also found everything to be very clean. I would stay there again.

<Content>Noise all night Don't expect a good night's sleep. It's sad: the location is great, the staff is pleasant and helpful, and the beds are comfortable, but the uncarpeted floors, thin walls, and drunken guests make for a very noisy experience. Earplugs didn't even help!

<Content>14 Feb to 17 Feb 05 We booked 3 nights in a triple room for ourselves and a double room for my wife's mum and dad at the beginning of January 05, paying 拢56.50 per night for the Triple and 拢44 for the double. which was a bargain price compared to the rest of the hotel in that area, we were only be given one of the standard, unimproved after reading some of the reviews over the pass 6 months, I have to say some of the comments are spot on! The rooms were small but clean and tidy the beds made every day with fresh towels in the bathroom., however if you are one lucky one's and get one of the upgrade superior rooms then you will have even more of a bargin added to you your break.I also agree with recent comments made regarding problems with traffic noise. The hotel is located next to a busy road however but with having double glazing doors this kept the noise to a minimum and certainly didn't stop any of us from sleeping.The staff were ok but notice in one of the comments made about a very unpleasant male receptionist which i have to say he was, the others were friendly and helpful though! The breakfast was very considering the price we paid. The situation of the hotel is perfect for most of the sights in Barcelona and more so the Subway which is just around the cornerWe all had a great time and would recommend the Hotel Oasis to anyone, especially with value for money. I would say that once the refurbishment is complete the hotel prices will go up, so if you are planning to go to Barcelona and want value for money on room and location then go soon rather than later. You never know you could be one of the lucky one's and get one of the superior rooms.

<Content>good for a quick break We booked online so knew nothing of hotel oasis. It is undergoing major re-furbishment and we had a newly re-furbished room on 5th floor. Room was good size, nice  clean, but when we drew back the curtains we realized our room was in the centre of the hotel and we had no view at all and hardly any natural light. However, we were only staying 2 nights and there is so much to see in Barcelona that we were only in the room to shower  sleep. Bathroom was fine and beds new and linen spotlessly clean. Perfect location, 5 minutes walk to the sea and La Rambla area. Lots of bars and restaurants close by. Perfect for short stay.

<Content>The Perfect Surprise! We booked a triple room for ourselves and our small grandson way back in July through Easyjet, paying just over 拢200 for four nights for the three of us. Bearing in mind this bargain price, we expected to only be given one of the standard, unimproved rooms and after reading some of the recent reviews, I even tried to upgrade to a superior room without success.  Imagine, then, our surprise and delight, when, on arriving on February 7th, we were given an electronic key to Room 419 which turned out to be a spacious, recently refurbished superior triple room. The room was very well furnished with three large, comfortable beds, a desk and chair and still enough space to sit and move around easily. A small balcony was accessible through double glazed patio doors with a view across the street and to the square behind. The bathroom was simply beautiful; better than our own at home! The only thing that was missing was tea and coffee making facilities but we had taken our own kettle and cups so this was no problem. I cannot comment on the other rooms in the hotel, of course, but it is fair to say that as works of improvement are obviously still ongoing it will probably be a while before these are complete and the other rooms brought up to the same standard.  Other reviewers have mentioned noise as a problem, but the traffic noise, whilst all that you would expect from a four lane main thoroughfare and busy crossroads just outside the hotel, was cut down considerably by the double glazing and never stopped us from sleeping. (Ambulances are very obvious, and frequent, however; there must be a large hospital nearby). We simply didn't hear a sound from other residents; we only knew that we had any neighbours when we saw them in the corridor.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was spotlessly cleaned and the beds made every day with fresh towels in the bathroom. The breakfast was fine, eaten in a pleasant breakfast room and more than enough to set you up for the day. There is also a decent little bar and restaurant, which we used on our first night, but, to be fair, with a six year old, the food was a little wasted on him and we had to rely on the joys of the local burger and sandwich bars (of which there are plenty nearby).  The situation of the hotel is perfect with some of Barcelona's most interesting sights very close by. The Bus Turistic stops 100 yards away (the two day tickets are excellent value) and this gives you access to most of Barcelona. Many of the best sights are well within walking distance and the city seems reasonably safe (although be careful of handbags and cameras as my wife nearly had hers taken on Montjuc by two guys on a motorbike - just don't leave anything lying unattended for any length of time. Sadly, its the same in any city nowadays, I suppose.)  All - in - all, we had a wonderful time and were very sad to leave our room, and Barcelona, behind. I cannot fault the Hotel Oasis in any way and would recommend it to anyone, especially having regard to the amazing value that it offers. Hopefully, we will return to Barcelona one day and we certainly will not be looking further than the Hotel Oasis and Room 419!

<Content>Very good value for money We stayed 4 nights from 26th to 30th of January in a superior room (double). We booked from Hotelscentral - for slightly more than 30 euro per person per night this is definitely a great choice if your budget is not too high and you prefer saving some money for a good restaurant instead of wasting money in a hotel. The rooms and furnitures are quite new. The breakfast (buffet) is better than other three or four stars hotel I have visited. Only drawbacks: as the room was almost on Placa de Palau you could hear some noises in the morning due to traffic. Further the curtains of the room allow some light to enter when the sun rises (only for people who needs absolute darkness to sleep). Apart these minor drawbacks I would definitely recommend this hotel and the superior rooms. The other good point of Hotel Oasis is its position: Barceloneta metro station is 100m far, bus stop is just outside the hotel. And above all the hotel is located between the Barri Gotic and Port Vell so the location is perfect. There is also a restaurant where you can eat for 8 to 12 euro depending on the day (more expansive in the week-end). We never tried it but if you are too tired to find a restaurant (however there are many quite close to the hotel in the Barri Gotic) this is another plus of Hotel Oasis. If I will return in Barcelona I will definetely stay there.

<Content>noisy, scruffy, unfriendly Stayed 3 sleepless nights in Oasis, It will be the last! Very very noicy!! all floors, including hallways, are tiled! so that every footstep is amplified throughout the building. No sound proofing between walls so that you can hear every sound at night, toilet flushing, showering + t.v noice. This hotel is ideal for people who are heavy sleepers, drunk till unconsiousness,or people who require little or no sleep at all!A word of warning! beware of pick-pockets, shifty barmen and rip-off taxi-drivers! They all operate arround Barcelona with the same aim, TO RIP OFF THE TOURIST!! I was unfornunate to meet all three!

<Content>standard bad,comfort fab! Just back yesterday from Oasis.We originally booked a standard room but it was very tiny and scruffy with very basic bathroom and thin dirty walls, dirty carpet and teeny wardrobe. Really awful! We asked to see a comfort and decided to upgrade immediately. It was on the other side of the hotel and all rooms on that side are superb with card keys and hairdryer, large room and well decorated. Really the rooms on that side are like 4* rooms. Even the corridor on that side is different newly painted and with lovely paintings and sturdy modern room doors.Please bear in mind you will get a bill at end of trip for upgrade(in our case 60 euros in total as we stayed three nights). There was no mention of extra when we asked for different room so keep money aside if you upgrade. We thought extra was well worth it. The breakfasts were lovely, buffet but with good coffee and juice and tasty rolls and croissants. The location is great on Placa de Palau and we had a fantastic trip. I would definately reccommend but only if you book comfort room.

<Content>great value ,good position just returned from oasis and we feel it is ideal for a short break and great value ,we booked through easy jet and the whole trip worked fantastically. Oasis is by the harbour(2mins)on the tourist bus route (a must) and a nice 5-10 minute stroll to the ramblas along the seafrontThe staff are really helpfull. Our room was very clean,very well looked after and the bathroom was lovely. The only downside was the continental breakfast but that has been the same wherever we have stayed! I would definately use the oasis again

<Content>Oasis was a gem for a 2 star! We have just spent 2 nights at the Oasis in Barcelona. We had no complaints with anything, the staff , the rooms and bar/restaurant area were more than adequate for what we paid. Its location could not have been more central for the amenities, as they were right there on the doorstep. The metro station was a stones throw from the front door and this gave you superb access to the rest of Barcelona. A baggage room was also provided on our day of departure and this was also free of charge. I would not hesitate to stop here again. Well done Hotel Oasis keep up the good work.

<Content>Good Base To Go From stayed here with friends from uni in sep, went to barca to see gaudis work. This hotel was booked cheap through easyjet and we wernt expecting much, on arrival we got our keys and causiously went to our rooms. But nothing to fear a good hotel, basic but as it was a base to start from it was good, clean and bed comfy. Am going back in jan with uni, allready booked through ryanair (cheaper than easyjet) and got others to stay.

<Content>Would definitely stay here again Considering this is a 2 star hotel, it is really comfortable. We had a nice triple room with balcony and side view to Montjuic. There was hardly any traffic noise considering it was very close to a busy street. We booked a superior room We didn't see the rooms that had not been refurbished-perhaps the poorer reviews came from people staying in them? Hotel was very clean and bath and shower both worked well. Breakfast is not great-but it is just a 2 star hotel. And who needs a minibar in Barcelona!

<Content>Unhelpful Staff After 7 nights on a cruise, we were apprehensive about booking into 2* hotel. However the hotel was fantastic for location, cleanliness and price but we found the reception staff (just one guy in particular) very unhelpful and felt uncomfortable whenever we needed to ask him anything!Great for visiting the Zoo, Barceloneta and the Metro.

<Content>Excellent Value for Money I stayed with three friends from 16-19 September. The hotel was ideally situated close to Port Vell and Maremagnum. The rooms were bright and airy and were cleaned every day. The staff were helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast was excellent value and ideal for the start to a day of sightseeing. As far I am concerned, the negative comments posted earlier (which may stop others from staying at Hotel Oasis) were unjustified. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will certainly make a return visit.

<Content>Good basic hotel This is a good basic hotel right in the heart of Barcelona, close to Port Vell (2 mins), La Ribera, (2 mins), La Ramblas (10 mins), the beach (10 mins).We stayed in a triple room (501) and there was plenty of space, although we had no balcony and the view was of the hotel's aircon. The bed and room were clean and came with bath and a shower attachment in an adjoining area. You don't get a big TV, just a portable, and there's no fridge/minibar in the room, but what could you expect from a 2* hotel. We're going back to Barcelona and will probably stay here again. Good value for money.

<Content>Good value for your money! Hello,I just stayed in Hotel Oasis and liked it al lot! It's a nice hotel on a perfect location. That's because it's only a 10 minute walk to the beach and The Ramblas.The rooms are clean and there's everything you need like cabel-tv and airco. Unfortunately the standard rooms are a bit noisy. Not from the outside but you can hear the other hotelguests in the rooms near you.The breakfast is OK (buffet-form) and you can have good dinners for only 鈧? in the evening.The staff is friendly and gives good service if there's a problem.

<Content>Highly Recommended Stayed at the Oasis in September 2003. The rooms were air conditioned, larger than average size and clean. The metro station is practically on the doorstep and the beach is only a 5 minute walk away.We paid only GBP55 per night per room which is fantastic value. Its only rated a 2 * (perhaps because it doesnt have the small touches such as irons or room service) but the rooms are of a much higher standard. Would stay again.

<Content>Excellent Budget Hotel Having read a few bad reviews on this site I was a bit worried about the standard of hotel I was going to.This worry was to be unfounded as the accomodation was of a higher standard than other 4 or 5 * hotels I have visited. The room was newly refurbished incl new bathroom, and was extremely clean.Breakfast was basic but no more than I expected as per described (continental).I would advise that you avoid eating in the restaurant/bar next door as the food isn't the best.Location was good it is down by the Port Vell which gives easy access to many restaurants and bars.I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, helpful staff Before we went to the hotel, we read the reviews with some trepidation when we heard stories of bed bugs. In fact whatever problems the hotel were having they clearly are over them now. The room we had was small, but very clean and well tended. The bathroom was very well equipped with a bath/shower, WC and bidet. The staff were very polite and helpful, the breakfast was simple but fresh, and there were no sign if any bed bugs! So we just thought we'd put this up for anyone who's due to go there now.

<Content>Hotel Oasis was perfect After reading a couple of the last bad reviews of the Oasis hotel, I must have stayed at a different hotel.Got back from staying there last night and have nothing but praise for it. For a 2 star, it more than meets the required standards. Very clean rooms, fully air conditioned with friendly staff.Room was expertly refreshed each day and the buffet breakfast was a nice start to each day. Televison with 2 English speaking channels (CNN  Eurosport) in room, along with clean en suite bathroom.What more could you want from an affordable hotel, slap bang in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona?Stay with confidence. I did.

<Content>Supurb!! Just retured from the Hotel Oasis in Barcelona. We were very worried about this place due to the other reviews on this site but upon arival we had nothing to worry about!!!There was a party of 15 of us and we had three tripple rooms and three double rooms. Every room out of the six was supurb.... clean, comfy and ideal!! Some areas of the hotel look like new and it's looks as though they are slowly decorating and modernising the whole building. Breakfast was again brilliant bread, ham, cheese, croissants etc.We paid 拢90 each for the weekend and stayed three nights, and could not fault it in any way.Staff were also very friendly and the location is ideal we couldnt of asked to be located any better.Bar was brilliant and again nothing could be faulted.In conclusion this hotel SHOULD NOT be a two star and i would go back here straight away and recomend it for anybody looking to travel to the geat city that is Barcelona!!!

<Content>This place sucks! If you love major-sized cockroaches marching across a miniature (6 X 10) room then this is the place for you. A thick layer of dust in every out-of-the-way place looks like it had been there, untouched, since the days when Catalonia was an independent kingdom. Amenities consisted of one sliver of soap.

<Content>Noisy! Ok, we stayed at this hotel on a Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Saturday and Sunday nights were extremely noisy. Every sound made in the hallway can be heard in your room and vice versa. Granted, Barcelona night life runs very late, but if you've just arrived from the US and need some sleep this isn't the right hotel for you.We didn't have a problem with the cleanliness. The hotel location is ok. It's a bit of a walk to Las Ramblas, but it is a short block to the Metro.The staff wasn't particularly helpful.I'd definitely stay elsewhere. We selected it because the reviews here were pretty good and the price was right (Barcelona is pretty expensive). The negative reviews were posted after I'd booked.
