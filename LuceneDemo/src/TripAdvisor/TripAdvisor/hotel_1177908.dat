<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent location Lovely hotel in a brilliant location, next to the river, 200 metres/ yards from the Ponte Vechio, but no crowds or hawkers. Spotless, characterful and quiet rooms. Very pleasant and attentive staff. Great value for all that. Would stay again without hesitation.
