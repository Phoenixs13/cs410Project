<Content>Lovely setting, great decor, so-so service, awful room, terrible prices I stayed over a weekend, with my wife. We took a package that gave you 3d/2n with dinners and breakfasts for $425, from which you could deduct $75 with a discount offered by the Paradores de Puerto Rico website. Service is corteous (all young), but sometimes a bit intrusive. *Everything* is rationed: from the ice, to the dinner rolls, to the food portions (the food is extremely good, to be fair), to the rooms (ours was tiny; you literally had to squeeze yourself through the front of the bed to reach the extremely noisy A/C and the other side.) In theory, there could be surcharges for everything, from moving a bed, to returning towels outside of a time window... you feel like you're in summons, and not a guest. Then, there are the surprises: you're offered soup as part of a dinner, but they won't tell you they'll charge $6 for each soup bowl, until you get surprised at the end...The ambiance and decor is lovely in the outside (the big pool looks like something out of Town and Country magazine), short of spectacular (they're in the middle of a wildlife preserve, truly blessed when it comes to location), but the rooms leave much to be desired. I found a cockroach in the bathroom, the floor tiles were a bit gritty, and the bed's linens deserved a throught cleaning. Yuck.The prices do not reflect the value offered. One could forgive the small rooms if they were better kept and more hygienic; the food tastes great but if you take the package, you're limited to the same six options all through your stay. The setting is great, but decor and location do not a hotel make... I'm being generous with the rating since everybody there appears to be friendly and receptive to criticism, but it charges 4-star prices for 2-star service.

<Content>Two Flew Into the Cuckoo's Nest Bahia Salinas is rather unique by virtue of the scenery and location, but we knew we were in trouble when we spotted employees dressed like orderlies, ostensibly to tend to those of us that were bonkers enough to pay the grotesquely high rates. Our room was well-appointed but only a munchkin with a two-by-four for back support would appreciate the saggy bed and miniscule dimensions. Our poolside waiter was a trainee and took the better part of an hour to produce a Coke minus the rum. The desk clerk promised a kayak but the the kayak person didn't show up. I have my own kayak but to use it is strictly verboten. The pool cleaner started cleaning at 7 a.m. on our last day and was still cleaning when we finally abandoned all hope of a cool dip by 11 a.m. and checked out. (photo attached). Bring along some nuclear mosquito repellent or you will be devoured before you finish the appetizer of your sunset dinner. $9 will get you a bottle from the gift shop. Our waiter mercifully let us borrow the house DDT, otherwise we would have succumbed to malaria before counting out the tip. In spite of it all, the charm and beauty of the place manages to transcend it's idiosychrasies, that is as long as you enjoy the smell of sulphur in the morning as you gaze down from the balcony upon a decrepit outdoor collection of tanks and machinery. It also helps if you are up to a long hike to the Cabo Rojo lighthouse in the blazing sun. I have to admit that the food was great and we drank enough wine (that my son ordered by phone from Miami) to forget the aggravation and enjoy our 31st anniversary. As you can tell we loved and hated it all at once. That is the Puerto Rico experience.

<Content>Not For Everyone Situated in a Nature Preserve on the SW tip of PR, Bahia Salinas is uniquely special for its isolation and location. We spent four nights here in the middle of July. The pool is beautiful. Our room on the second floor was small though pretty. We had no problems with the hot water and the bed was extremely comfortable. We found the staff to be friendly and accomodating.The reasons I write that it's not for everyone are as follows: 1) The resort is on a really narrow strip of property. Since there wasn't much property to care for, I felt that what was there could have been better maintained. 2) The pool, which is beautiful, closes at 7:00 - why? There is nothing else to do here. 3) Since the hotel is in a nature preserve, they are not allowed to spray for mosquitoes, gnats, ect. We ate at the beach side restaurant on our first night and were driven inside by swarms of gnats who ended up swimming in our wine. We were glad we did not opt for the meal plan since we never ate there again. 4) I was sure that breakfast was included in our room rate but was told upon arrival that breakfast was not included. We ate at Mary's bakery every day right down the street. Which brings me to 5) The Rate. We paid about $170 a night - no breakfast incuded. In my opinion - way overpriced.The overall experience of this hotel and surrounding sites was good. There is some good birding to be done on the salt flats. I'm glad we went, but would probably not return to Bahia Salinas Resort.

<Content>Weekend in HELL The place and service was a terrible since we got there. IT IS NOT HOT WATER. The tiles of the rooms they were black from the dirt. One of the moms in the group makes a reservation for 2 rooms and they never book it. The hotel where expecting that the pregnant lady sleep with her husband and 2 kids in one bed because was too late to resolved the issue. The service at the restaurant was terrible. Hold on what service?????????? It is no service .We wait for over one hour just for some of the drinks. It is no real beach in that resort. It is a mangrove. I will never recommend this hotel to anyone I know. NEVER. The worse part it is that we talk to the owner about the issue and he just tells us that was our opinion. With a management like that I can't speck anything better from the people that work there.

<Content>Don't Judge a Book by its Cover This place was terrible from the inside out! We paid way too much money for what we got. Our room was horrible, beds uncomfortable, we didn't get hot water and even had a lizard in our bathroom and it was not much for a romantic getaway when they put your room in front of the kiddie pool- so at 8am we were woken up to kids screaming. We had brought snorkle gear since they said there would be a place to snorkle, but there was no place to go and the place recommended by the front desk staff was horrible. We couldn't even go in front of the hotel because it was pure muck. They did give us a new room after we found the lizard in our bathroom, but it wasn't much of a difference except we had hot water and no more lizards. We were going to rent a kayak, but there was never anyone there to help us get the boats- you have to call a number off site to gain access to them. It was a good thing my husband and I didn't bring our two small children because there was a mass of bees by the kiddie pool and over 30 dead bees floating in the kiddie pool. We CAN NOT believe the same pictures on the website were actually taken at this hotel. The breakfast wasn't bad, but for 200+ dollars a night it should have been better- everything should have been better. If all you want to do is sit by a pool and read a book and occaisionally look out over the ocean and pay $200/ night- this is the place for you. I feel bad being so critical- but the place was truley terrible and we hope you don't make the same mistake we did by going there- we would not have wriiten this review if they charged $60/night and were honest with their website and what they had to offer. The staff was nice for the most part, but we will NOT be returning or encouraging anyone to go there.

<Content>Misleading!!!! This hotel's website was completely misleading!!! First of all...the hotel is far from everything!!!! It is located near a salt marsh and a mangrove (which by the way was in fact beautiful). We paid $179 a night. We were given the very last room in the resort (all the way in the back). The website photos lead you to believe the hotel is on the beach...which it is. However, you cannot use this beach because it is a mangrove. If you want the closest beach it is about 10 minutes away on a number of unmarked roads and very secluded. There is no one on that beach except for youngsters who go there to party. The quality of the room was extremely poor. Not worth the money at all. No telephones, old comforters on the bed, smelled funny, cheap tv, not enough channels, no iron, NOTHING!!!! When I called (from my cell) to request an iron, I was told I would have to walk all the way to the lobby to pick up an iron and table. Ridiculous! I would not return to this hotel. I stayed at Rosa del Mar in Hatillo and for $120 it was 10x better than this hotel.

<Content>ZERO hot water, stinks This hotel is right across the street from the salt flats and stinks like decaying fish. Depending on what room you are in, you can smell the stench in your room! Also, there was no hot water ever!When I asked the front desk they told me to let the water run for a few minutes and it would get hot. We let it run 30 minutes and it never got hot. So the next morning I thought surely we would have hot water but unfortunately it was the same situation. When you eat breakfast at the hotel be prepared to have at least 1 or 2 of the half starved stray dogs stare are you with longing for scraps.The only good things at this hotel was the comfortable bed and the pools and grounds were very pretty. The setting is nice except for the stink of the salt flats.

<Content>The office staff 'misplaced' [stole] my daughter's phone! DO NOT STAY HERE FRIEND...READ ON,Where do I start with this overpriced dump?First, my daughter left her bookbag in the office upon checkout. When we called, nobody knew about the bag. We called again. Oh, the bag was found. Was the cell phone with the bag? Yes. Could you please mail it to us and bill our room? Certainly. Waited a week, called. Woman said she could not mail without charge card number. I politely told her to use the one her business used to charge our room. Waited a week more, nothing. Called, she claimed Federal Express had not come by. Frustrated, I drove for two hours across the island to pick up the bag myself. When I got there, the phone was missing, though two of the female employees had seen the phone, safe behind the office desk. Nobody could say where the phone was since anything was possible! The manager/owner was, naturally, on a trip to San Juan. We left. I have been calling for over two weeks now. In the U.S. I would have called the police. What a nasty experience. This hotel owner has no moral, no standards, no class. I wish I could report him to...someone. Truth is: In Puerto Rico, Americans get ripped off on the regular-even by so-called nice places like this moth-bug infested hellhole.Second, you can't go in the water because it is...toxic. Really, you cannot go in the bug-infested water in front the the spa because it contains dangerous microbes, too near the mangrove and salt flats. The water stinks and is murky.We paid way too much for our nasty room. I woke up with hotel throat, though the place is supposed to be some sort of spa. For the same price, in Mexico, you can stay in a truly wonderful hotel. Not this dump.Guess what: we should have known better. We checked in on a weekday, thought at the height of the tourist season-not another guest the whole time. The manager glared at my well-behaved children splashing in the deserted pool. It was clear the place was structured for the singles set, or honeymooners. I cannot imagine spending a honeymoon in this dump.The truth is this: If you took this place and set it down in an area not infested with bugs and crawling, slimy things, it might be kind of nice. But then you would still have the surly workers, and dishonest management/owner.When we checked in, the woman acted as if we were disturbing some great moment. But this is typical of the Puerto Rican hotel workers; they obviously hate their jobs and could give a rat's butt about customers.The salt flats are very interesting, if a bit deserted and not safe for families. The local beaches are really quite wonderful, but I would perhaps stay in Rincon next time-which I usually do.This place has bad vibes, and I am guessing it starts with the owner. By the way, for the prices you pay, the restaurant kind of sucks, too, and the service is lame.Again, you would be better off heading to Rincon.I call every day, but the manager/owner refuses to return my calls. Maybe the workers are not giving him the message?Welcome to Puerto Rico!

<Content>Caribbean Paradise It is truly a hidden treasure. The setting in which this hotel is located is extracted direct from a travel magazine, I had the opportunity of seeing the most beautiful sunset from the hotel's infinity pool. The hotel's restuarant, which has a huge deck overlooking the ocean, is above par and has a nice selection of fresh seafood. Anythiong you order you must order a la Salina's, the restaurants special suace, you will not be dissapointed.

<Content>Beautiful scenery! Lousy Hotel! We just finished our stay at Bahia Salinas, and would really not consider staying again unless certain changes are made to the hotel and the staff. Bahia Salinas' location, on the southwest tip of Puerto Rico, is beautiful. It's a serene environment, with mangroves, and a nearby lighthouse and beach, as well as a nature preserve. Sunsets across the ocean are goregus, and the dark night skies are great for watching the stars (just bring lots of mosquito repellant or be prepared to be eaten alive). The hotel, billed as an upscale boutique hotel, leaves much to be desired. The rooms are small and rather spartan (bed, AC/TV, and not much else), some with small or nonexistent windows. What really got to me was the fact that in the morning we had no hot water. Argh! I'm paying $170 per night to have NO HOT WATER??? When we complained at the front desk, we were told that the hotel's water heater was solar powered. Oh.... so on cloudy days... no hot water? To top it off, the front desk's attitude was unapologetic, take it or leave it, as if to say, there's lot's of other people who want to stay here besides you, we're doing YOU a favor by letting you stay here. To be fair, the hotel pool is great and the landscaping tasteful. The restaurant food was overpriced, but good. So overall, the stay was wonderful, so long as we stayed OUTSIDE our room. The rooms and staffing attitude have to be brought up to par with the price! Next time we travel down to southwestern Puerto Rico we'll go enjoy the scenery, perhaps have dinner while enjoying the sunset, but head elsewhere to lodge. There are several places to stay along the coast. In la Parguera (Lajas) there are several cheap hotels. There's a parador hotel called Villa Parguera which is excellent (and half the price). A little further east in Guanica you can also find Copamarina Resort. It's more expensive than VIlla Parguera, but more peaceful and secluded.

<Content>Guests' comfort is a very low priority, much better deals elsewhere in area My wife and I are not nit-picky travelers incapable of rolling with the punches; we are used to adapting to things being different than anticipated when we travel. However, our recent experience at the Bahia Salinas Beach Resort and Spa (BSBRS) in December 2007 tested our endurance dearly, and since we paid $174 for the pleasure (the cost of one night鈥檚 stay, though we checked out three hours after check-in without even spending the night), we feel entitled, and dare I say it -- obligated -- to share with you why you must avoid this place at all costs.Unlike what its website suggests, BSBRS, an apparent one-time motor motel converted unconvincingly into a purportedly upscale retreat on a very narrow and skanky spit of land, is far from an oasis of peace and relaxation. Here is what we encountered upon check-in at 4 pm on a Saturday in December 2007:1) an outdoor wedding reception, replete with track after track of heavy-bass dance music, in the hotel鈥檚 very narrow courtyard, on which virtually all rooms and the 鈥渞elaxation鈥?spa at the hotel face directly and in very close proximity. Having nothing else to bounce off of other than the very thin walls and windows of the guests鈥?rooms, the soundwaves easily penetrated into our second-floor hotel room, causing us deafening reverberations while we entertained our very first thoughts of checking out and fleeing. When we complained about this politely and immediately at the front desk, we were told a) just to endure it, it would be over by 11 pm at the latest, or b) to come see the only other room available (which we did, and it was closer to the loud music, without a single window, and dark and depressing). When I then asked about reducing our stay from the scheduled three nights to just one or possibly even zero nights, they said they could not refund our money, even though nights #2 and #3 had been paid for only 10 minutes prior, at check-in. I am sure they could have refunded it to us had they wanted to, both because the credit card authorizations for the day could not have yet been finalized, and because you would think they would feel ashamed of the loud noise to which guests were being going to be subjected for some 7 hours straight. Furthermore, when I raised the matter of how unconscionable it was for them to book a wedding right in the courtyard, the front desk staff person was totally unapologetic about it. As someone who himself runs a public facility back in Texas, I can tell you that this hotel should not even be in the business of hosting wedding receptions, because there is nowhere to hold them on this hotel鈥檚 property (other than the restaurant across the parking lot) that will not interfere with the quiet and relaxation of the hotel鈥檚 other guests. The hotel management is being financially greedy and self-centered to book weddings here, in blatant disregard of the other guests鈥?comfort.2) our hotel room had a piercingly toxic, plasticky smell that would not go away no matter how much we aired it out3) due to technical problems, the hotel could not process American Express cards at time of check-in, and though the staff had known of this issue for days and I had used an AmEx card for my hotel deposit several weeks earlier, no one thought to call us and tell us ahead of time to forewarn that we must bring another form of payment. On top of that financial inconvenience, I was also out a 3% rebate that my AmEx card provides me when I use it to pay for hotel stays, and the hotel staff didn鈥檛 care about that point either.4) the hotel has a plethora of rules and policies designed for the convenience of hotel staff over that of its guests: all swim towels must be returned to the front desk by 9:00 pm every day (rather than at end of stay, as is normal at other hotels), the pool closes at an ungodly early 7:00 pm, etc.So, having checked in at 4:00 pm, by about 7:00 pm we had verified with Visa that they would reverse the charge for nights #2 and #3, had loaded all our luggage back into our car, and had turned in our room key to the new front desk person, telling them 鈥渢his is what your hotel gets for booking an obnoxiously loud wedding in the courtyard 鈥?now you鈥檙e out our two nights鈥?room charges plus whatever else we would have spent here on drinks and meals鈥? Already nighttime, we drove eastward toward Guanica, where we had a delightful three-day stay (at a lower rack rate than BSBRS!) at the Copamarina Beach Resort, where guests鈥?comfort and convenience are paramount, the rooms are large, peaceful, and delightful, and nothing obnoxiously loud is tolerated.

<Content>A mistake that cost too much I traveled from Charlotte NC to meet a wonderful lovely woman. The resort Bahia Salinas was very expensive for what they offer. The highest they should charge is $110 not over $200 per night. The room was very small no amenities. Bathroom was small , with a small sink. The pool was nice, but they close pool at 7pm. The restaurant was nice friendly people and good food. The mayor problem at the restaurant was too many ants running all over the tables and they have nothing to control that. Bring your mosquito spray they will eat you before you finish your food. There is nothing to do beside staying in your room or in the pool. What made this trip a good experience was the the beautiful girl I went to meet. I would not go back or recommend this resort to anyone. They need to improve..too bad they don't read the reviews to improve.

<Content>mixed review the decor and landscaping is lovely and the staff is friendly, BUT be aware that1. you cannot swim here! it is a shallow mangrove swamp. there are swimming places nearby, but not at the resort itself2. not all rooms are spacious with balconies as described. we got stuck in a cramped room with windows opening onto a wall!3. the food is good, but the service is slllllooowwwww, like 40 minutes to an hour to get a hamburger.the prices are on the high end for paradores. we have stayed in much nicer ones for less. all in all, I would recommend the place, but with serious reservation.

<Content>Fantastic if you know what to expect I spent 4 nights mid-week in June with my family in two rooms (next to each other in front of the kids' pool). I say mid-week and it is important because (this was my first stay in PR) I now understand that resorts and resort towns are completely dead during the week and get busy at the week end. So we had the resort for ourselves and it was great. The resort is between the salt flats (in exploitation) and the sea. The beach is swampy but the view is to die for. There are nice beaches on both sides (accessible by car or walking), bring your bug spray. The view from the cliffs and the lighthouse are great. There is not much to do in the hotel (this is not really a resort, kayaks and ping pong tables would not hurt), it is remote and relaxing. Service is friendly. Staff finds it difficult to get out of the routine, but the routine is good enough. Food in the evening is good if the chef is in good mood and does not want to close the kitchen too early (again, mid-week). Go to Joyuda Beach or La Parguera for more choice. The peninsula on which the hotel sits is just incredible for jogging, cycling or walking in a nature preserve. The rooms are big (ours had no phone). Next year they plan to add 38 villas, it could get more crowded. All in all, this is a Parador, inexpensive for what you get, in the middle of the most incredible nature settings in PR.

<Content>Tourist trap We figure this innocent looking hotel was the right place to have our wedding. It turn out to be a disaster. After signing a contract 4 months ahead and numerous inconclusive phone calls , they changed all the terms without taking any consideration on our part or the 125 guest. The tried to CRASH our wedding.Being small cheap in the middle of no ware, we though a situation like this wouldn鈥檛 happen there. We pick this little hotel because of sentimental value, not for real value. We as residents of PR really know our turf . As love birds we use to spend a lot of time in the Cabo Rojo restaurant  beaches areas.We pick this hotel even though it doesn鈥檛 have a beach in the resort. They promote 鈥渂each weddings鈥?but in reality are 鈥渟wamp weddings鈥?There is a immense mangroo swamp lagoon on the back side of the hotel and a abandoned salt processing plant to the front. The nearest beach is about 35 min hike on a secluded pathway.( Check the area in satellite Google maps). Caution be a wear of stray dogs, mosquitoes and bad people in the area. Cheap things turn to be the most expensive ones. Thankfully there are plenty of options here. Now we are very exited to have our wedding in Rincon in four star resort. Please save you and your love ones a disaster like this keep away from this TOURIST TRAP.Xiomara  Angel Luis

<Content>Horrible people! I did not even stay in this hotel. I called to make a reservation and i was treated HORRIBLE ! I called to see if they had availability for me and my boyfriend to stay there. When the repceptionist answered the phone i asked to be put thru to reservations. She did so. When the lady in reservations answered she just said. The rate available is $200 something a night (CLICK) and Hung up! I did not even understand what she said!!!! What horrible service! She did not even say her name, or good morning ANYTHING ! The hotel looks very beautifull but obviously lacks hospitality and service.

<Content>Check your I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. The time you wait for your food is mind boggling. It takes hours just to get your order on the table. The place stink like hell..........coming from the shallow beach front...do they have one really?.........The employees have the premium parking space. I park once inside and they chase me away....as if I was some local who happen to sightsee. The pool is nice...but nothing like the Frenchman Reef Hotel in St. Thomas. It was an ordinary pool nothing to be proud off. The spa? nothing fantastic and awesome....I will not trade it for The Golden Door Spa in Hotel Conquistador. I was treated like a real paying custumer there. The spa offer is basic and redundant. I can go to any beauty saloon and they offer a much better bargain for it. The beach front? Cant swim! Can use the water it is infested with mosquitos and jelly fish. Food is good and tasty but nothing superb like the Rincon By the Seas. This Resort I highly Recommended due to their professionalism and promt service when ordering your meals. They are very good and attentive to your needs. And the food is excellent.Bahia Salina is good for people who are looking for a resort who want to sacrifice convinient. From the dark and damp rooms, to a restaurant in which a meal takes a lifetime to be serve and the smelly water from its beach front (specially in the Morning and Late afternoon...EWWWW). Mosquitos? They are plentiful...I ask them if they can lit up a citronella candle and the response was....that I have to live with them since they are part of the package. I almost blew my top....helllllloooooo!....horses! Mosquitos!?......This place isnot for people who are pinicky and have been to hotels and have their needs taken care off without asking for it. I do have one good experience with one nice gorgeous lady there at bahia Salinas.......and she is not human.....she is the Parrot they called Chalina. LOL

<Content>Great hotel...wrong staff. This parador is just beautiful. It does not have a great beach (nature preserve), but awesome beaches are nearby and the parador has two nice pools to make up for it. The sunset is to die for. The food is superb and the spa staff is very friendly. The only problem is that the general staff is a bit [--] or aloof. For example, we dared feed a dog that walked into the property and you would think we had killed someone. The same thing happened when we accidentally parked in the employee parking area鈥攎ore convenient than the guest parking. Our joke all along was: Is this allowed? Will we be yelled at? Being Spanish-speaking, I overheard comments made by staff about non-Spanish speaking guests鈥oo sad. This could be a four-star location just by adjusting the attitude a bit.

<Content>Special place! Bahia Salinas Resort and Spa is gorgeous and perfectly maintained. It is built facing a calm mangrove bay with swimming in a limited section.. Constructed only in 1998 with 27 rooms, two pools, one an infinity pool, a bar, contintental restaurant, (an Italian restaurant is due to open shortly we were told) and spa, it is romantic, , with lush gardens and an attentive staff. They are constantly cleaning and tending to the gardens, cleaning the pools, etc.The hotel is a three hour car ride from San Juan airport. Located in the southwest tip of P.R., it is a perfect get a way for a few days.After sailing a charter boat in the B. V. I's for 10 days, we arrived for R and R at the resort on Jan 16, Tuesday to Saturday a.m., which turned out to be low season. They said they had five rooms rented. We saw a few Norte Americans over the next 4 days, but had the pool to ourselves for the most part for the few hours we spent there.Breakfast is buffet style. Made to order eggs. Bacon, ham, home fries. Fruit, cereal, pastry, etc.Check to make sure they are serving lunch the days you are there. We slept through breakfast the first day, arrived for lunch at 12 and discovered no lunch service, but the chef or cook who was there made us good sliced chicken sandwiches and fries. If lunch is not on the off season schedule, stop in a local mercado (supermarket) and pick up cheese, vacuum packed salami, etc and crackers or whatever works for you. We used ice buckets to keep the perishables cool. Soda/drinks help too. The local nectars are delicious and cheap.What we ended up paying for the four nights turned out to be less than what was quoted on the web site, about $30 less per dayI Best to call the resort for a quote first. It's a US call on the cell phone, no extra charge. 878 254 1212. They speak English.See the photos on the forum page.If you want to pull yourself away from the pool, walk down the beach to a white sand beach which has snorkeling (bring your gear). Or drive a mile further south to the restored Cabo Rojo Lighthouse. It is not open for admission yet and the road is a challenge to get there, but doable if you drive slowly. Park below the lighthouse, walk up the stone path and walk around the lighthouse for spectacular views. Then see the perfect beach cove near where you parked. If you have brought towels or a fishing rod, enjoy the serenity. Unless it is a weekend--I understand the Puerto Rican people pull up in their boats and unload their jet skis to spoil the ambiance.La Parguera is a 40 minute car ride. That is where you go for the ride to the Bioluminescent Bay. To get there, use the map the hotel has. The boats go out an hour or so after sunset. Wear a bathing suit and go out on the smaller boat (22 passengers)that goes into the mangroves. You will be closer to the water even if you choose to not swim. Get a bite or drink before at Yolanda's, up the street from the boat marina. Yolanda's is owned and managed by Antonia DiLillo from Toms River NJ area. Great burgers and fries, nice guy.Boqeron is a beautiful beach about 20 minutes north (admission with car $3, nothing to walk in) bordered by a ramshackle looking town. Some restaurants overlooking the waterlooked decent though.Joyuda Beach was 40 minutes north of the resort. We went there to watch the sunset and get dinner at Bahia Vista Restaurant. It's claim to fame, besides the sunsets, is the 50 or so tarpon that swim around the deck pounching on pitched over the railing tidbits from the diners above. Oh for a fishing rod!Do not even think of stopping in Mayaguez, one hour north of the resort . What a disappointment. The old town and port is worse than a slum and the two hotel casinos a bit north of the city are a disappointment. They do have pools on the grounds and the Mayaguez Resort is building a water slide and assorted other water goodies to attract families with kids. Could not find a town center with any decent shopping or anything that would make me want to get out of the car. Shopping is wonderful in old town San Juan and San Juan is worth repeated stays for a few days of R and R and an easy escape from the northern winters.Getting to the resort: Use the directions they will send you and get a map from the car rental place. We drove south from the airport, through Ponce in the south, then west. We returned to San Juan using Route 2 going north, then connected with 22, the super highway, which has no lights, and allowed us to make it to the car rental place 2 1/2 hours before our flight. We allowed 5 hours for the ride back because we meandered off the road to explore sites of future stays. Nothing appealed. We would go back to Bahia Salinas Resort and Spa, maybe in February and over a weekend, when things are busier.

<Content>Wonderful!!! This is a wonderful small hotel. If you like tranquility and being away from civilization this is the hotel for you. The grounds are very well maintained and the staff is very friendly. The restaurant was superb. Although you can not swim in the beach in front of the hotel, the hotel's infity pool is wonderful and the small hidden beach at the end of the dirt road (next to the lighthouse) is like no other on the island. My husband and I spent 10 days going from beach to beach and this was one of the prettiest we enjoyed.

<Content>Bahia Salinas Resort: great place, great location, but lacking in service Since I find these reviews to be rather useful, particularly the detailed ones, below is a rather wordy summary of my recent stay at the Bahia Salinas. The first paragraph is the 鈥渃ut to the chase鈥?version鈥?br/>I would recommend this Resort, with several caveats. Pros: Hotel grounds are well maintained and aesthetically pleasing; infinity pool was very nice; staff is friendly; I would rate the restaurant very good to excellent in terns of the dinner food. Cons: Can鈥檛 swim in the beach in front of the hotel; service was slow, and on a few occasions terrible; after 6pm have your Deep Woods Off handy to repel the mosquitoes. I鈥檒l leave the evaluation of the rooms in the details below, as that is subject to personal taste. Now for the 鈥渨ordy鈥?version鈥?br/>First Impression:We were 2 families. The adults are in their [early] forties, and the children (all boys), are 13, 13, and 17. Our stay was for a Sat-Sat. Both opted for the meal plan. As soon as we checked in, we were impressed with the grounds. As we walked to our rooms, we passed the infinity pool and couldn鈥檛 wait to jump in. Rooms:The rooms were clean, and IMO simply, but tastefully furnished. There are no phones or clock radios in the rooms. And the TV has limited cable (ie. no ESPN). Some might find that a con, and some might like it. Since there is nothing to do in the evening, a little Sportscenter before bed would have been nice. You could hang meat in the rooms with the air conditioning, but you can adjust it (from cold to not as cold鈥鈥檇 rather have that extreme than an inadequate system). Both families initially opted for the divided queen rooms. There is one bedroom when you enter, and the bathroom is between that and the 2nd bedroom for privacy. The trade off is space. Both BRs are small, and there is little closet space. My friends had the same layout, but since their room was in between other rooms, the back bedroom had no windows, making it very claustrophobic (ours was at then end, so both BRs had windows). They changed to a 鈥榮uite鈥?which was basically a single room, with 2 queen beds (no divider), and room for a desk and chair. Hammocks and rocking chairs in front of the rooms was a nice touch. The bathroom toiletries were a pleasant surprise.Amenities:As I mentioned, the infinity pool is very nice, and was never crowded during our stay. I suspect that with only 22 rooms, if you factor in guests coming in and out, and some hanging out by the kiddie pool, or at the bar, the pool can never get crowded. The spa and beauty salon were open during our stay, but we did not get a chance to take advantage of them. Poolside towels were easily available at the front desk (must be returned before the end of the day). The public poolside bathrooms were immaculate. And although there is no swimmable beach in front of the hotel, you will find one of the most picturesque beaches in all of PR a short (and bumpy) drive from the hotel. It is nestled between 2 cliffs, one of which has the famous lighthouse. You can walk it from the hotel (its about 1 mile), just take enough liquids for the walk to and fro.Food Service:Here is where it goes downhill. Breakfast was fine: simple buffet, though I would prefer some other options for drinks other than water, orange juice or coffee. Service varied, but not enough to give breakfast a negative review. Lunch, on the other hand, was not worth it. The service was horrendous. We waited at least 90 minutes for things as simple as hot dogs and grilled chicken sandwiches. One person ordered the grilled chicken over greens (in lieu of sandwich), and had to wait extra, only to be served sliced chicken breast cold cuts over lettuce. Upon complaining, it took 10 minutes to get what she initially ordered. Might have been OK had we gotten some drink service, but upon serving half the table with Pina Coladas, the other half was left drinkless. And all they ordered were cokes! In all fairness, they only have one person who serves as the waiter, bartender and busboy. But there is no excuse for the delay in the food鈥houldn鈥檛 take 90 minutes to cook a hotdog. And it wasn鈥檛 like there was a large crowd either. Dinner was very good, but again the service was a bit slow. There is a difference between 鈥渟low鈥?service and bad service, and they were walking that fine line during dinner. The food, however, was very good and offset the 鈥渓eisurely鈥?pace.Last word:If you want something quiet, comfortable, relaxing, and off the beaten path, Bahia Salinas is for you. If you stay here, you are probably the adventurous type and/or are quite familiar with the area. As such, I would not recommend the meal plan. Have breakfast at the hotel, but for lunch venture out and try some of the local fare (we discovered 鈥淎ntojitos Evel鈥?in El Combate to be a favorite amongst the locals, and rightfully so). Certainly have at least one dinner at the restaurant, but there are other options in the general surroundings. The service notwithstanding, I personally would not opt for the meal plan since I hate being on a schedule. I prefer the flexibility of eating when and where the mood strikes. The place has a 3-star rating, which I think is fair since in some areas it exceeded the rating, and in some it did not meet it. If they would improve their food/bar service, this would be a great place to stay (rather than just 鈥渞ecommended鈥?. That, and ESPN ;-)

<Content>Nice but never a 4 star resort Nice small hotel for those who want to be away from civilization but at the same time want to be 20 minutes from going back to it. Do not dare to come here looking for action or night life, and never without a car. The restaurant was excellent, far beyond my expectations but the service was not that good. It was not that they were rude. It was evident that they lacked training. If you do not bring a car, be sure to bring good company and/or plenty of books to read because there is nothing else to do.The closest airports are Ponce and Aguadilla, both one hour away. San Juan is three hours away from this palce which is right at the Southwest poin of the Island.

<Content>Stayed an extra night We really enjoyed this hotel and even stayed an extra night. We were travelling with our two and a half year old and our room had two separate bedrooms. (A great option for kids)While the hotel is still under some construction, it is beautiful and we did not find the construction disturbing. (We are very early risers.) The shallow pool for kids was a great hit with our daughter, as was the caged birds near the restaurant and the hammock outside our door. We ate at the restaurant for two nights and two breakfasts on the meal plan as well as an additional lunch off the appetizer menu. We found one dinner to be much better than the other and the breakfast buffets to be very good. I would love to come back and see this hotel when it is completed. It is a lovely place to relax. Prices were between 80-$150 a night including the meal plan and there were only a few other guests. We felt this was a great deal. Please note that some of the information on the website is misleading since they are completely renovating the hotel and it was difficult to know what is new information and what was previously there. There is no playground for children as of May '06 and the spa and poolside restaurant were under construction.

<Content>I have not stayed but I don't recommend their restaurant. I had gone to Bah铆a Salinas Restaurant a few years ago with my wife and daughter. The food wasn't good enough for the price. In summer 2005 my wife and me and some of my wife's relatives had a short vacation in Combate, Cabo Rojo.We called the restaurant and made a reservation. When we arrived, a person, (I don't know if he was the manager or owner) told us that he had no reservation for us and that he already had a large group waiting for the next available table. The wait would be more than hour and a half.We decided to go to another place, which ended being a very good one. Think twice if you plan to go to Bah铆a Salinas.Rinc贸n Beach Resort or Rinc贸n of The Seas are beter choices.
