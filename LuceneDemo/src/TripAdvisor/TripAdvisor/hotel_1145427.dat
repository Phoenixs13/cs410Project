<Content>Nice place but there are better This is our third year in a row to Punta Cana and all though this was a nice place it wasn't as nice as the other two. The Princess Bavaro was the best and the Caribe club was next. They all have their pros and cons but for two couples in their late 40's we missed a few things at the IFA. There were no balconies for the rooms or a place to play cards or just sit and talk. The beach was farther away than the others. Only one room key made it difficult at times. The pool chairs were bolted down and although there was plenty of sun, there weren't enough chairs in the sun as you couldn't move them.  The staff was nice, some went out of their way for you and others didn't. There was enough english speaking to get by. The food was similar to other places. The rooms were nice and clean. We enjoyed ourselves at the IFA but I would go to one of the others in the future.

<Content>Yearly Vacationer My husband and I take a week long vacation every year to celebrate our marriage and enjoy each other's company. We love to travel and we usually treat ourselves to nice accomodations. After reading all the reviews we were a little leary of this resort, but our daughter and her fiancee were already booked here so we gave it a try.Keeping in mind we usually stay at 5star luxury resorts....we did find this resort nice. We have always believed you get what you pay for....and for any couples on budgets or people wanting to save a little money...this resort is very nice. It was VERY clean. People cleaning all the time! Food was adequate....not a huge selection, but it was good. I didn't see anyone go hungry. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The staff was very friendly and helpful.The sand on the beach was so white and fine.....it was wonderful.Many ladies going topless at the resort and beach so it may not be the place for children or young families.Advice: take a washcloth. (None provided....just towels and handcloths) We took our own shampoo but theirs was fine.PACK LOTS OF SUNSCREEN and drink plenty of bottled water. Don't overpack...you'll most likely just wear bathing suits all week except for the nights you visit a restaurant with a dress code.
