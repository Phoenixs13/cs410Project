<Content>Dingy As another reviewer said before me, the rooms are dingy and clearly not worth the money. The 80s furnishing is boring and - what is worse - the website of the hotel proudly displays photos of really nice rooms, but none of the other tourists at the hotel (the tourists that I had a chance to speak to) had even caught a glimpse of those mythical (by now) rooms that looked so chic on the hotel website! That was very confusing, to say the least... The room I stayed in was fairly clean. Some members of the staff were nice, friendly, helpful and efficient, but others just couldn't figure out how to deal with some issues that demanded their attention. That was pretty sad as well as annoying. Nonetheless, breakfast was really good.

<Content>Beautiful Rooms, Excellent Location My parents stayed here for three nights in October. This was the best room of their two week stay in Germany. They had room #27 all three nights of their stay. It was a very large room that overlooked a very quiet street in the West End. The room was decorated in a tradition Laura Ashley style and was extremely clean. The bathroom was huge including a big tub. Breakfast in the morning was also very good. This hotel is a good option if you don't want to stay in a major chain hotel (there are plenty in Frankfurt). Highly recommended!!!!!
