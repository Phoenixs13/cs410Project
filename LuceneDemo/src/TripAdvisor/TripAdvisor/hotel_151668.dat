<Content>Very disappointed I had gone on this web site to check out this property as I learned straight away that it was not a Paradore any more.Their web page did not work and my email to them bounced back. I then had to call them to book. Decided to go anyway after reading reviews.Very disappointed. First, it is now owned by the city of Jayuya and is no longer private. We asked for room 4 as Foders or Frommers suggested that room 4 and 5 were the best (last years book) We knew it would be rustic but little things were not right like my husband had to crawl under the bed to plug in the lamp (he isn't getting any younger!) There were 3 light bulbs out in the ceiling and one on the deck. The ceiling fan did not work. Ironically, the beds were OK (reading reviews said otherwise) Then in the morning, there was water all over the floor in the bathroom (toilet or? who knows) There had been a rain storm the night before. Also the bathroom was the smallest we had ever ever been in. Very basic all together but sort of expected that.The food was terrible......we both ordered a meat with beans and rice and got dried meat (chicken and pork) Very basic menu. The breakfast was no better.I have to say the staff was very pleasant especially the man at the front desk. The pool was too cold. The bar was closed as apparently they were having problems with their liquor licence.It is such a shame as the surrounding area was lovely and the main dining area and seating areas were charming. It just needs better management.

<Content>If you love nature and dont expect luxury this place is great. I really have mixed feelings about this Parador, the location is very nice, you are surounded by nature and peace. However the hotel could improve certain aspects such as the beds and the room conditions.We arrived early, around 10 am, and were checked in at once, we stood in room #9, which was really modest, a simple bathroom, a few drawers, and a TV with cable,however it was spacious, the rooms dont have windows but wooden shutters without screens which we loved because you could open them and enjoy the view of the mountains and feel the mountain breeze. No need to turn on the A/C. We had problems the first night, the bed!!!! It was in really bad shape!!! You could feel the holes and the springs because it was really worn out. No matter how many sheets or blankets it was still horrible. In the middle of the night my husband went up to the desk to inquire about changing rooms, it was then when we realized that after 10pm all the employees leave, they lock up the office,the little lobby and leave the guests on their own, in the office the post a number to call in case of emergency, but thats about it.Next morning we asked to be changed. we were moved at once to room #5 and given a discount for the night. The room was perfect, it was right next to the beautifull antique lobby, it had an antique decor with stone floors and furniture, the room even had a great spacious wooden balcony looking over the pool and the mountains, the balcony has a table, 2 chairs and a little hammock, there was even a bird nest of this native bird that sang every morning. The food in Gripinas is good, nothing gourmet, very local, we had the chicken asopao which is a hearthy soup,delicious!! We also tried the rice and beans served with skirt steak, very good. The breakfast are wonderful, they make a great coffee and the a delicious farina. You must try the eggs with local ham, great!!! All the food is well proportioned, and the staff is really accomodating.Our experience with the hoseback ride was not so good, we went to the desk asking for info about hoseback rides, the girl told us he would sent someone to the room with the info, 10 minutes later a man called To帽ito showed up offering us the tour. My husband talked to him for a while and was quite puzzeld when he was asked how much each of us weighed. In short ,offered us a 2 hour tour for 50 dollars, which we considered ok. He picked us up at the front of the hotel in a shabby jeep which felt it would fall appart any minute, we drove for maybe 10 minutes and arrived at a wooden shack wich he claimed was his home. From there we would start the ride into a coffee plantation. What we saw next was shameful, 2 rather small horses in bad shape were being prep for the ride. They looked kind of skinny and tired, no wonder they asked our weight, these horses would not been able to carry a common overweight person.It was also strange that this man who was our tour gide had two 14 year olds tending the horses and made them come on the tour with us by foot. At first I was skeptical but they all insisted that it was ok and that they did this tour everyday. We started the ride going up a really steep hill, the horses breathing became so heavy that for a moment I thought they would colapse, the two boys went up by foot, while all the time the guide To帽ito followed us in his jeep. We were led into this beautifu plantation, here we were explained about the the history of jayuya, the local traditions and the process of puertorican coffee harvest we were also taken to a lovely stream where we rested for a while and headed for an anciet indian burial ground. The place was lovely but I kept being distracted beause my horse was famished and kept on going off course to eat the grass. One of the boys (Miguel) was really sweet and asked me a lot of questions, I asked if he gets payed for what he does, he said no, he just did it for fun. On the way down the horses were so tired I decided to give it a break so I decended on foot, I even got a taste of some bananas right off the tree, and some water directly from the stream, it was totally safe. Once we got back to the hotel I commented to the desk about the condition of the tour, their response was just quick reply oh well, we really dont own the tour, we just recomend them. So much for safety and quality concern.Besides that our stay was ok, I would return for a weekend, maybe just for a night but not more than 2. If you have kids, skip this place, there is no activities at all execpt for the pool which is small and the water is always cold because it comes directly from the mountains, no nightlife whatsoever, and town is really boring.You need a car to go to all the fun places like the Indian ceremonial park which was great. If you are looking for peace and quiet, love nature and are not looking for any luxuries this place might be good for you.

<Content>Mixed Feelings I delayed writing this review to see how I felt upon reflecting on our experience. Let me first say that my comments about the room all relate to room number 10, the room we stayed in. I am convinced that there are better rooms at this property.The location: This hotel is truly in the middle of nowhere. We had no cell phone service at all, and the craziness of the cities of P.R. is nowhere to be found. For those of you reading this, I think the best way to get to Jayuya and Hacienda Gripinas is through Ponce, even if you are in San Juan. It was recommended to us by several Puerto Rican friends not to drive along the northern coast and then into the mountains, but to cut across the island on the tollway to Ponce and then drive up. We did that, and based on what others have said, I think we spent less time on the winding narrow mountain roads. Let me echo other reviews: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIND THIS PROPERTY AT NIGHT. The people: For the most part, the people who work at H.G. are some of the friendliest and most helpful we have encountered on our travels anywhere. And we have traveled many places. They helped us with bags, took us to our room, etc. I wish they had provided us with more information about coffee plantations in the area. See below for our one unpleasant people-related experience.The food: The food is included here, and it is decent. It was certainly not the best food we had in P.R., but also not the worst. The service at dinner and breakfast was very friendly. Breakfast was very good. I recommend the omelettes.The pools: Just so that it's clear, the pools are fed by water running off the mountain. It is rainwater and cold. For those who are paranoid about swimming in mountain streams, these pools might not be for you. I don't think they are chlorinated. But we loved them, even though we had blue lips by the time we got out of the water.The room: Our room was not so nice. There were several problems. The water in the bathroom dripped constantly, and the bathroom smelled terribly of mildew and mold. The ventilation from the bathroom went into the open air hallway through a small window. The small window had no screen, and with the moisture in the bathroom, our room was a party for the mosquitos. So, upon our arrival, I killed every mosquito I could find, and I shut the bathroom door so that no more mosquitos could find their way into our sleeping quarters. To me, the lack of screens at this place is a real health hazard with the mosquitos. The window in our room looked onto the back of the kitchen stairs. The window was a long row of wooden shutters, again without screens, but they closed effectively to keep the mosquitos out. We just couldn't open them without risking flying visitors. Above the shutters was colored glass block. There were no curtains over the glass block, and there were about 6 120-watt bulbs in the hallway. All night long it was bright enough to read in our room because of the lack of curtains. We did not get much sleep due to the light. Because we did not sleep we decided to cancel our second night's stay and leave. That is where our problems began.Checkout: Early in the morning, we told them we did not want to stay a second night, and asked if we could have the second night refunded. We were told we'd have to wait for a manager. So we waited for an hour or so, enjoyed our breakfast, and then talked to a manager. The manager was polite and concerned about why we were leaving early. We told her about the light issue in the room, and she apologized. We asked her if she could refund us one night's charge, and she agreed to do it. However, she did not do it, and despite our emails, we have not received a refund for the second night, as of today. We are now disputing the charge with our credit card company, and we'll see if that will help.Conclusion: I would book this property for one night only. They will likely have a room available if you want to stay a second night. Ponce and its major hotels are not far if you can't stay a second night. Don't stay in room 10. If you have room in your suitcase, pack a roll of duct tape to cover the glass block and block out the light if you get stuck in room 10. Bring a swimsuit and enjoy yourself. If you love coffee like we do, spend a little time before your trip planning a route to visit different growers. I do wish the hotel had more information about different coffee plantations in the area. They only told us about one, but there are so many.

<Content>A Treat of a Mountain Retreat After the bustle of San Juan and its over-priced lodging options, my husband and I rented a car to see the heart of Puerto Rico. Nestled amid the highest mountains on the island and at the end of several twisting, narrow, cliff-hanging roads, we came to rest at Hacienda Gripinas outside the village of Jayuya. The hacienda was originally a prosperous coffee plantation and has retained the flavor and atmosphere of another era. We had a choice of two rooms and opted for one on the main floor, just off the dining area, a reading lounge, and main balcony. Our room opened onto its own balcony that overlooked a swimming pool with views of the mountains. Had the hacienda been busy, the location of this room next to public areas would have been less than ideal, but at most, there were two other couples that weekday night. Lulled by the wind and the sounds of coqui, we could easily pretend that we had this beautiful, quiet place all to ourselves. Our stay included both dinner and breakfast with many tasty menu options and ample portions. Miguel, our receptionist, host and waiter, was courteous and attentive - including finding an extra blanket for the cool mountain night. My only complaint was the erratic water temperature when I wanted a hot shower. It took a long long time running the water before it became hot and a short short time before it went cold again. At the mid-week price of $109 for room, dinner, and breakfast, Hacienda Gripinas is a budget traveler's dream. As a unique hotel with the character and charm of old Puerto Rico, it is everyone's dream. If we could have stayed longer, we would have, and if we have a chance to return, we will.

<Content>Hacienda Gripinas was a great experience Hacienda Gripinas is not a luxury hotel nor a resort, which is why it is so wonderful. One feels as if one were in the past (except for the ariconditioners) including the smaller rooms and simple furnishings of that time along with the multiple sitting rooms and public verandas.. And it is in the countryside (duh!) which includes bugs and a bit of mildew along with the incredible blossoming trees at your terrace, the charming coqui frog chirps, and the vistas. It is true that it is almost two hours from the caverns, but a look at a map will tell you that it is a winding mountain road that takes you there. Again, driving those roads were wonderful, with the towering clumps of wild giant bamboo along the way. If you are not interested in another culture and a different terrain, don't leave New York or wherever. And...the plaintain soup was the best soup I have ever had, with the Spanish omlette the next day excellent as well'; the rest of the food was Ok. $125 for two people to sleep and have dinner and breakfast seems totally fair to me.

<Content>Off the Beaten Track Simply driving through the mountains to get to Hacienda Grapinas is an adventure and is well worth it. The mountains in PR offer another world. The Parador is an old coffee plantation. The setting was lovely and the porches had extended views and were very comfortable. the place was very tastefully decorated. I had one complaint about the rooms. I had read that you did not need air conditioning because there were fans and you could keep the windows open and get the cool mountain air. In fact the fans did not work and you were compelled to use the air conditioning. The restaurant is very good. There are excellant short hikes along the roads outside past hills where coffee is grown. Within a short distance there is true excellant mountain hiking at Toro Negro State Forest, which offers very much the same experieince one would get at El Yunque.

<Content>Worth the time and effort Hacienda Gripinas was worth the travel time and effort. I promised to show my wife traditional mainland Puerto Rico. After staying in Old San Juan for 3 days, we were ready for a more relaxed atmosphere. The drive to Jayuja from San Juan takes about 2 hours. Our reception at the Hacienda was warm and friendly. Our room,# 5, was modestly furnished, clean and very acceptable. It had a private balcony which overlooked the main pool area.Breakfast and Dinner were part of our package. These meals were served in a clean and spacious dining room.The food was adequate, delicious and well presented.My wife and I don,t need a lot of entertainment. We took walks, read, and explored the Toro Negro. Without a doubt, We would return to Hacienda Gripinas...It was a highlight of our vacation.

<Content>shoddy treatment - not worthy of the "Paradore" distinction We made reservations here in November for a total of 4 nights in January. We arrived on the appointed check-in date at 4:30 in the afternoon, the place was apparently hosting a local mayors' convention, and had no interest in a couple of strangers. The young woman at the reception desk was very short with us -what do YOU want? When we said we had reservations, without even checking, she flatly responded, not for tonight you don't.We asked her to check and reluctantly she did so and declared that we could check in two days later but there was no reservation for the first two nights - and made it clear that she could care less about the fact that we were, with darkness rapidly approaching, miles from any place where we could get lodging.This was particularly striking when compared to our experience in half a dozen stays at other paradores around Puerto Rico. Typically the people are sensational, and whether it's rustic or resort level, the paradores are generally great. That made the shoddy behavior here even more striking in contrast.

<Content>Really remote I generally love historic lodges in rustic settings, but this property is simply not worth the trouble to get to. I reserved it after being told by the Frommers guidebook that it was close to the Rio Camuy Caves (a worthwhile stop). It wasn't. After an almost 2 hour grueling journey through amazingly twisty roads, we arrived. The lodge building itself is atmospheric, but the rooms are spartan (and you'll likely be sharing it with a mosquito or two). The kitchen tries -- but generally fails -- to deliver high quality food. There are apparently some walks available from the hotel, but they were inaccessible the night of my stay due to a gate being padlocked. One of the two pools was also closed for repair (the other pool was really too icy to be attractive). At least the drive south to Ponce from the inn only took about an hour.The bottomline is that this property isn't nice enough to make it worth the journey. If you want to see what a historic coffee plantation is like, sign up the the Conservation Trust's tour of Hacienda Buena Vista, just a couple miles from Ponce.

<Content>Nasty Placeeeeee!!!!! This place is in the jungle. It is full of nasty roaches, it stinks as hell, and it is very expensive for nothing. The rooms are nasty looking, the beds are falling apart, the service is terrible. There is a waiter named Miguel Batista (father) who was drunk while working, the food is ok, but they really need to work very hard inorder to bring up this place. I don't recommend it at all.

<Content>The worst room ever and very poor food! I have never been to a crappier and dirtier hotel. And it cost me over $130 for the night. Awful rooms, very difficult to reach, bad quality food. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. Stay away from it!!!

<Content>Lovely setting and GREAT FOOD! We got to the Hacienda Gripinas for the night just after sunset. This was a great place to stay, a restored old coffee plantation that now has a lovely hotel in the mountains that includes a wonderful 3 course dinner (the onion soup rivaled that of a French bistro, my snapper was ok and the fried chicken spices were superb) and hot breakfast ($130 total for two: ---). The rooms were nothing too special, but there was cable and a lovely mountain view into a valley! They have horseback riding tours through the mountains but it was raining so we couldn't go as it was deemed unsafe until it got dryer.

<Content>A Walk in the Clouds For a getaway from the increasing urban development that's become characteristic of the Puerto Rican metropolitan area, this guesthouse is perfect. My girlfriend and I stayed overnight in room #5 and we loved the guesthouse, its setting, the openness of the guesthouse and the grounds. Our room was off of the main living room and had a semi-private balcony that overlooked the pool. Our bed and pillows were lousy, but the serenity of the mountains and singing Coqui frog more than made up for this. The ride to the town of Jayuya from the east (Cayey) is itself a breathtaking ride through winding roads with awesome vistas. The staff is friendly, courteous and attentive. There was no hot water, which was disappointing after our 4+ hour trek and given how cold it can get up in the mountains (relative to the lowlands, of course). If your getting in at night, bear in mind that getting to Gripi帽as is tricky and signage is non-existent. We had to stop to ask for directions several times once we got into the town of Jayuya. Dinner and breakfast were included with our stay as was a courtesy Pi帽a Colada (sans alcohol -- no liquor sold in Gripi帽as). The Creole Snapper left a lot to be desired and I've had better rice and beans all my life. Breakfast on the other hand, a Spanish Omelette, was much better. For all the rave reviews about the coffee, I found it mediocre. All in all, Hacienda Gripi帽a was a wonderful retreat from the metropolitan scene.

<Content>Honeymoon Paradise If you want to get away from all the loud and fast pace hotels. I definitely recommend Hacienda Gipinas. It was a little difficult in getting there but the travel was well worth it. It you love the Mountains and living with Nature you will Love Hacienda Gripinas. It was my first time in seven years that I got a chance to escape with my wife and we loved the atmosphere. As soon as you get there mountains will surround you and you actually notice the rich smell of nature in the air. The Hacienda has a cozy restaurant and the food is very good. Nearby you will have some tours that you can take and see some Indian carvings on rocks that are over 500 years old. You can visit coffee plantations and buy Puerto Rico grown coffee. Nearby you can go to the highest point in Puerto Rico, which has a Spectacular view.The people are very hospitable and they are always there to tend to your needs. The rates are great and they have Honeymoon packages as well. I recommend this Hacienda to everyone. Have fun in Puerto Rico.

<Content>Bonus for atmosphere Very nice experience. Inn is converted old coffee plantation house. Very basic, small, clean rooms. Fixtures are worn and beds sag. Best rooms are those off main sitting room overlooking pool (? numbers 45 ?)-- those have private balconies. There are 4-5 more rooms on lower level that share a veranda looking into a garden -- in these rooms expect to hear everything your neighbor says  does. Nice atmosphere, great outdoors sounds (loud tree-frogs, birds, roosters). This is a sit and chil location -- bring a book and read it in the hammock. It's a long-ish twisty drive getting from Ponce (use the new highway 10, not the old one). Stays include food (since there's *nothing* close). Food is served with care and quite good. Go for the atmosphere, not the amenities.

<Content>Pleasant country hotel A pleasant old-style handsome hotel, rambling 2-storey structure with lots of balconies, set in nice greenery. A relaxing atmosphere - you could spend all day on the balconies and in the small gardens and pool. Rooms may be a little worn, but okay. Not personal, as it is rather large. It is on smallish grounds in a village. Around it all you can do is take nice walks up the small roads. For rambling by car, the whole area is beautiful hills with waterfalls etc.. We did not greatly like the dinner which is included, but they do try and it is well served in a dining room.
