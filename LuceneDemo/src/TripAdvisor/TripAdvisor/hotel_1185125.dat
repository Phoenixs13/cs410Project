<Content>Amazing Boutique Hotel near Train Station This hotel is within easy walking distance from the train station yet offers much nicer accomodations than the other low priced hotels like the National, etc. Breakfast was great and the rooms were immaculate. The hotel is brand new and features double paned windows and very comfortable bedding and modern bathrooms. The front desk staff was extremely kind and helpful. Quite near to a grocery store (1 block) and an Italian restaurant (3 blocks). The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the train station if you get your directions correct. (Don't head towards city center) Only complaint is the ceiling fan (no a/c) can be noisy. One room was crazy loud, another was fine. My wife stayed in a room and the fan was unusable. During the summer hot, hot months, this would not be a place to stay.
