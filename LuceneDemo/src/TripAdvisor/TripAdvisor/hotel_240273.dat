<Content>Clean, modern, but trains are loud.... Clean, modern, staff reasonably friendly. Located just a block away from a bus stop that will get you in from the airport for just 7 euro. I had read other reviews warning about the trains, so asked when I made the reservation if the room faced the rail lines. Was assured that it faced the street, so there would be no problem. Well, the windows faced the street, but the exterior wall was on the rail line and it was loud. Seems to be a commuter line, so only a few cars at a time and not all night, but did start up pretty early. Enjoyed dinner in the restaurant that's in the building (you need to exit the hotel and walk a door or two down) our first night there

<Content>Think carefully before you book I first tried to book two rooms at this hotel last November via the hotel website. Unbeknown to me, our booking was not activated and so when I called to confirm a week before we were due to travel I was told we could only have two single rooms without bathrooms. As we needed to be near the train station and as we had so little time left to find an alternative, I agreed.The rooms were not ready when we arrived so we left our bags and returned at 4pm. We had to carry our cases up three flights of stairs and down a long, narrow corridor to the rooms. What we found could best be described as 'spartan'. The rooms were very clean but very small, furnished with metal-framed, slatted beds with very thin mattresses. The rooms had no washbasins, no bedside lights and cheap blinds but no curtains. The bathrooms were at the other end of the corridor. My 6' 4 brother, who had travelled all the way from Australia was not impressed. In fact, he was very tired and very angry. We refused the rooms and left at 4.30pm. The staff were apologetic but not overly concerned. I had booked this hotel for its proximity to the station, not because of the room rates. We found an acceptable hotel nearby at twice the price which we were happy to pay for the extra comfort.This hotel polarises opinion. For middle-aged and/or weary travellers I would say 'think carefully before you book'. It may be trendy, but it isn't comfotable.

<Content>This is really a great place I had such a good time at this hotel in the summer of 2007 and feel that some of the negative reviews are not doing justice to the institution. My husband and I stayed for 3 nights, two at a newly renovated building and one at the old one. Unfortunately, the latter is not equipped with air conditioning and double glazing. Maybe that's why some gave out such harsh reviews. But the rooms in the new building are just amazing. Our room decorated as a bird's nest overlooked the parliament building, which was fantastic at night. And the room was right next to the train track but we could not hear a thing with the window closed. I remember my husband marveling at the German technology! The room becomes cold as soon as you turn the air conditioner on. The lobby is very arty, the backyard picturesque, and the location great. This hotel deserves much more than 3.5. Do not let negative reviews discourage you.

<Content>Wonderful We stayed at this hotel in June and liked it very much. It's so stylish. The experience was marvelous. It's location is central, it's easy to get anywhere you want. Still we had a problem which was that our first room Loop was near railroad station so it was very loud there. But we easily changed our room which has it windows facing inner garden so the problem was solved. Both rooms were great nevertheless. So I just recomend to specify if your windows will face railroad or no.

<Content>Cute and quirky but don't expect to get any sleep! My brother and I decided to use this as our base to explore Berlin, from the website it looked very cool and we stayed in a funky room all spray-painted gold with bananas all over the walls and hot-pink velvet bedding and curtains. But the fun stopped there. When we arrived we found packets of earplugs on the bedside table, NOT a good start. Then when we opened the curtains we found the railway RIGHT BY THE WINDOW. Bit scary. Very loud. My advice would be to drink as much of the local beer as possible before retiring for the night, otherwise you won't sleep. Also, when we were checking out the woman behind the counter was EXTREMELY rude and obnoxious and kept pulling faces at my brother. He's not used to crazy Europeans so was a bit offended :)But otherwise, easy to get to, central and surrounded by great bars, restaurants and places to see.

<Content>Amazing hotel! We stayed here in July 2007. Our room was in the budget section of the building over looking the gorgeous, quiet courtyard. The room had gorgeous high ceilings, the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in, and was completely spotless. Our washroom was down the hall, but seemed to only be used by us. It was very comfortable and sparkling clean.We found the hotel staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The location is very convenient to the train station and major sights. This is a very unique urban hotel--almost worthy by itself of a trip to Berlin!

<Content>Great location, but you better love trains My partner and I just stayed at the Arte Luise Kunsthotel in Berlin. It sells itself as one of Berlin's cool, artist-designed hotels, and we were looking forward to staying in a unique room with an individual design, near to the thriving centre of Berlin. The hotel certainly has a fantastic location, 5 minutes taxi ride from the Hauptbahnhof, and 5 minutes walk from the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate. However, the room was a disappointment - large, but with somewhat damaged art on the walls, and the noise from passing trains was pretty overwhelming at first (the hotel is virtually on the line between the Hauptbahnhof and Friedrichstrasse). You know it must be noisy when the hotel supplies earplugs in the room... In its defence, you do get used to sleeping with the earplugs, the surrounding neighbourhood has some great cafes, and it's only about 90 euros a night (which is cheap for a hotel in the Mitte district). I also suspect if we had paid for a more expensive room, we would have been more sheltered from the street/train noise. Takeaway lesson: if you want to appreciate the art and the location, trade up for a swankier room and ask about noise when booking.

<Content>A great place to stay We stayed at the Art Luise for six nights at the end of June. There are really two separate hotels--the new wing in which we stayed and the older section. They are completely different places. The rooms in the new wing are very modern with excellent sound proofing and a very good central a/c system. There is a elevator. Even though the rooms are next to the train tracks, we had no problem with the noise. The hotel spent quite a bit of money on the sound proofing and it works. The odd thing is that automatic blinds were installed outside the windows. They do not do a very good job of keeping out the light--that was a far bigger problem than the noise. Also the rooms do not have clocks. Bring your travel alarm or have a cell phone that works in Germany because we did not get our wake up call to either room for our early flight home. The location is great--a 5 or 10 minute walk to Friedrichstrasse station with lots of good local restaurants along the way. We would definitely stay (in the new wing) again.

<Content>Loved This Hotel Our group occupied 3 rooms at this hotel in June, 2007 and had a wonderful experience. We stayed in the new section right on top of the rail line and had no disturbance at all from the train that ran there well into the night. Due to the double - double paned windows, there was virtually very little sound. This is a great area of town to be located in, staff was friendly and rooms very clean. We had an excellent breakfast daily located next door in the restaurant. I highly recommend staying in the new section of this hotel.

<Content>Not for everyone This is a clean, friendly hotel but it is not for everyone. There is no elevator in the 'old' section of the hotel so if you are on the top floor--expect to carry your luggage up three flights of stairs (there isn't a door man or bell hop to assist you). I am not quite sure if they have an elevator in the new section of the hotel so check before you register if this is an issue for you.As one individual mentioned, the train tracks are located near the hotel so if you are a light sleeper - bring earplugs.Also, there were some rooms that were single rooms with one bed (you would need to share a bathroom). Our room had a small clean bathroom adjacent to our room.On the plus side, the staff was very friendly and helpful-probably one of the best during our two week stay in Germany. The location is great - easy walking distance to some of the main attractions, obviously near the train station, and a short walk to the bus terminal. The breakfast was served in a restaurant next door which served cereal, fruit, cheese, meats, and great German bread. The hotel is suited for older children but may be difficult for someone with small children. I believe it is a hotel suited for couples on vacation and business travelers.The art throughout the hotel would be classified as 'very modern'. We had a 'minimalist' room which was a fairly accurate description. My husband would stay here again but it would not be my first choice. It's a nice hotel but definetly not for everyone.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I鈥檝e stayed at this hotel for about 10 times until this date, each time for a business trip. and it is an absolutely fantastic hotel. I would recommend it to everybody who visits Berlin.The kunstlerheim is an art hotel almost in the center of the city. Each room has been designed by another artist than the previous room. It all adds up to a nice, relaxed and somewhat mystical sphere.The rooms are always clean, the beds are good and the sheets are always clean and will be cleaned each day during your stay. The bathrooms are of a fine quality, even the public ones on the floor (and there clean too).Breakfast (costs about 8 euros) is served at the restaurant next-door and is a typical, but excellent European breakfast. The personnel is very adequate, friendly, speak English well and they鈥檙e very fast with they鈥檙e e-mail and fax replies.Three minor negative points (if you care about them) are that there is no elevator in the old part of the hotel. Another is that the rooms do not have a TV. And the final point I heard others complain about, but personally I have not been bothered by it, is that a sub-way/train passes right next-door to the hotel.Basically a very special artistic hotel and great value for the price you pay for it.

<Content>This is a great hotel! We stayed at the Kunstlerheim Luise for our first 2 nights in Berlin--what a great way to start! Our 2 rooms had very different art installations in them (our daughters chose the one outfitted like a giant seagull's nest, complete with hovering beak and huge eggs). We also asked for rooms with air-conditioning, for which we were very grateful during the recent heat wave. Our rooms were on the S-bahn side 2 floors up; other reviews have noted that this side can be noisy from the trains, but we could barely hear them. Breakfast in the adjoining restaurant is wonderful (and enjoys the occasional shake from the trains going by at this level). The hotel is near the Friedrichstrasse bahnhof and convenient for travel, shopping and restaurants. Staff was very pleasant, beds were beautiful and comfortable, and bathrooms were pristine. Can't wait to go back.

<Content>Bring Your Earplugs My wife and I stayed for three nights in Jul 2006.Listen to me carefully: this place is LOUD. Like, unbelievably loud. It is right beside a train station. In the first room we saw, it was so loud we couldn't hear each other. No human being can sleep with such a din. However - when we asked to move to a quieter room, the staff was VERY helpful and found us a room in a quiet(er) corner. So we had a happy ending.The best thing about this place - you can get breakfast next door for 8 euros, and it is completely worth it - it was probably the best breakfast we had in all of Germany. One more thing - no elevator, so I hope you like climbing stairs.

<Content>This could be the answer for your trip to Berlin Have just spent four days in one of the small single rooms on the top floor with en suite facilities which are offered to budget travellers or `visiting artists'. On the plus side, the rooms were immaculately clean with an exceptionally comfortable bed. Mine was a `themed' room too which surprised me as I thought that these artistic flourishes only extended to the pricier accommodation. The reception staff were pleasant and helpful with the exception of one member of staff who struggled with English and did not know the price of breakfast. (Sounds petty? Thank goodness I wasn't a hotel inspector) The hotel itself enjoys a first-rate location just minutes away from Unter den Linden, the Reichstag and the Brandenburg Gate. And it's beautiful to look at. On the minus side... There is no way round this. The hotel is next to a high speed railway line. Some of the rooms are just metres away. Mine wasn't - but the noise was thunderous at times - as if the train was heading straight for the room! Anyone who has stayed here will know I am not exaggerating! This is scarcely the hotel's fault but I would advise anyone who's sensitive to noise to steer well clear.The budget quarter where I stayed is VERY spartan - those who value home comforts can forget it. It's hostel standard and if that's what you want, great. Otherwise, look elsewhere!There are no facilities like a bar in the hotel itself -just a drinks machine. In fairness there is a restaurant next door - Weinguy- which seems to have struck a deal with the hotel and serves breakfast to guests. It's NOT included in the price of the room and will cost you eight euros. Having said that it was worth the money and the surroundings were lovely. I got some very good feedback about their business lunch and evening meals.Because I wasn't staying in the customised rooms designed by artists, I don't know if I am that great a spokesperson for this hotel. I would however be interested to hear what you tripadvisor members have to say about this pricier part of the tariff

<Content>Stay here! This past December we stayed twice at the Hotel Kunstler Luise in Berlin, having stayed there once before four years ago. They offer a variety of accomodations, from singles to suites, and every room is decorated differently by local artists. We spent five days there, through New Years Eve, before going to Dresden, and stayed there again on our return. All of the front desk staff speaks english, and are extremely cordial. They allowed me to use the internet system located at the front desk for checking email, flight information, etc. As long as you're not greedy with time, there's no charge. The location provides easy access to the subway system, as well as a good selection of nearby restaurants. Each room has a unique artistic flavor, and the beds are quite comfortable. In fact, you can see images of the rooms on their website and request specific artists. A good buffet breakfast, consisting of breads, eggs, bacon, fruit, yogurt, etc., can be had in the restaurant next door (8 euros). I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone as it's both charming and affordable.

<Content>Unique  Stayed at the Kuenstlerheim Luise for 5 days (in a single and then double room, both without WC) and found the both the hotel  staff great! The rooms, designed by various artists were a hoot. The hall bathrooms were spotless and the breakfast at the restaurant next door was convenient and filling.Also this is a perfect base to explore Mitte  the eastern neighborhoods of Berlin. From my room I could see the dome of the Reichstag and it was a short walk into the neighborhoods surrounding Mitte.Perhaps not a hotel for business travellers expecting high end amentites but perfect for those seeking something affordable and fun...definitely not a sterile chain hotel! Oh-make sure your room isn't too close to the S-bahn side of the building. It's rumbling by may bother you.

<Content>Very unusual We loved this hotel on two different stays in 2003, but it is not for everyone. Each room has been designed and decorated by a different local artist. Very unique. Clean. Spacious lobby. The location is excellent, right near the Reichstag and Unter den Linden. We would definitely stay here again. A word of warning: the hotel is located right next to the train tracks. I found the sounds of trains rather comforting, but people who are light sleepers are going to have a real problem. (The rooms do provide ear plugs.) Breakfast at the next-door Weinguy was excellent, simple but varied enough.

<Content>Excellent hotel My son picked this hotel out of the Lonely Planet book on Berlin. It had arrived that morning from Amazon. We were pleased to find that we were able to book two rooms on the 3rd floor without difficulty, although to get the configuration we required we could not get either with ensuite WC or shower. This didn't matter nearly as much as we anticipated as we seemed to be the only guests on the floor, certainly the only ones using the large shared bathroom.The place was warm, very well fitted out, almost completely free of smoke (possibly these were explicitly non-smoking rooms) and very interesting. Apart from a couple of bulbs that had blown the room was free of all defects. The stairs are a bit of a climb but this was probably a good thing considering the number of gut-busting meals we ate in Berlin over the tree days.Breakfast at WeinGuy next door was excellent with extremely friendly and efficient service. The croissants were the best I've tasted anywhere in Europe and certainly better than anything available in the UK.We paid about eur 420 for three nights for two rooms.
