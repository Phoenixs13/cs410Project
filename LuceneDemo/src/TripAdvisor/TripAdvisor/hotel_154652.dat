<Content>Excellent taste of the 80's We stayed at Casa Blanca for a total of 5 nights during our trip to Mexico. First for two nights on arrival in Mexico (booked in advance) and the 3 nights at the end of the trip (booked after the first two nights due to high satisfaction).Casa Blanca hotel is very clean and has good sized rooms in 80's colour and style (mint green, purple and pink). The beds are fairly comfortable and the rooms come with cable TV, nice bathroom and safe. We got a room on the 11th floor during our 1st stay with great views of the western part of the city and the Plaza de la Republica. On the second stay we had a room on the 8th floor with an equally good view. Views are also excellent from the rooftop terrace with swimming pool (heated) and bar.Most of the staff is extremely friendly at Casa Blanca. Especially the breakfast waiters who adds to the already splendid breakfast buffet. Also the porters, receptionists and cleaners are very friendly. Only the bar staff could put on more of a smile, even though they are cordial and friendly enough.We recommend this hotel which provides excellent value for money (we paid USD 93,00 per night including taxes and breakfast).

<Content>Very comfortable base Stayed five nights here and thought it was great. Comfortable room in a quiet part of town and a superb breakfast each day - all you can eat etc. Hotel fairly well-positioned for Zocalo and Zona Rosa wandering if you like a 15 minute walk. Rooftop bar and pool really nice. Few complaints - TV picture was blurry and Internet access expensive. Would stay again and look forward to it.

<Content>Uninspiring I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights before starting my tour of Mexico. I found this hotel completely uninspiring. It's a very old-fashioned hotel, certainly in need of refurbishment. Especially corridors and rooms are pretty ugly and feature a smelly, old carpet. Rooms are small and painted of a ridicolous pink colours. Most of them have a view on a even more ugly inside courtyard. On the good side, I found breakfast to be pretty good in terms of quality and varierty of products served. I used their internet service and I found it very quick, efficient and not expensive at all. Another good point is the hotel location: right in the centre of the city, at walking distance from zocalo and zona rosa. Nontheless I would not stay at this hotel again. There was just no atmosphere. I'm sure Mexico City has got plenty of more modern and more inspiring places to stay.

<Content>Excellent place to stay We enjoyed every minute of our 5 day stay at the Casa Blanca. The employees were friendly and most spoke English. The food was excellent, the room was clean and inviting, the bar and pool area on the roof were clean and friendly.

<Content>Look elsewhere......... There are way too many options in Mexico City to waste an evening at the Casa Blanca. After reading the other reviews, we were optimistic about this hotel. However, upon our arrival we were quickly disappointed. The front desk was consistently unhelpful and frequently appeared annoyed when we asked questions. We booked this hotel through Expedia and when we arrived, they did not have our reservations and we were placed in a smaller room than what we had reserved. The room we were given faced the traffic and we were (un)fortunate enough to audibly experience the all night festival that was happening near the hotel. Further, the air conditioning was non-existent and we awoke to a very warm and bright room (as the room was directly in the path of the morning sun). We asked if it was possible to be moved to a different room as we were supposed to stay for two nights, but were told that the hotel (~200+ rooms) was entirely booked. Upon hearing that, we were quite suprised when the hotel bar never openend for the day as we expected they'd want to cash in on the big crowd that was staying with them. We did head up to the rooftop pool but had to share it with a local family who were quite friendly with the hotel staff (and receiving a good deal of attention from the staff) and obviously not guests of the hotel. Finally, though the hotel appeared clean, we had another surprise in store when we turned down the bed and discovered that the sheets were not clean. I'll spare you the full details, but the evidence was much more unpleasant than a stray piece of hair and involved stains. We also had difficulty using our calling cards as the hotel is not well versed in dialing 800 numbers. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The staff could care less, the bed was unclean, the room was uncomfortable, and the price can be beat. It wasn't until we decided to leave the hotel that someone finally offered to move us to a new room - apparently the hotel was no longer full.

<Content>Good Mid-Priced Hotel Option We stayed for 3 nights in late December and found Hotel Casa Blanca to be a great hotel for us. We had a junior suite for about $100/night - the extra room was nice with two kids - 11 and 14. There were two pull-out beds in the living room, and we also had a sauna (not that we used it much). The location is great, walking distance to 2 subway stations as well as the zocalo (about 20 minute walk to the zocalo). Our room was extremely quiet, although the fact that the hotel was relatively empty when we stayed probably helped in that regard. Hotel staff were very nice, and there always seemed to be someone at the desk that spoke English. We ate at the cheaper of the two restaurants on-site (the other didn't seem to be open) and had a good meal - nothing spectacular, but good and nice service.

<Content>Good Vlue, nice Hotel Stayed at Casa Blanca Dec. 9-11. Convenient to Hidalgo metro station, but little more. Not a great place at night for wandering about, not close enought to Zona Rosa to walk; take a cab. Even so, very good value, excellent staff, and clean, affordable room. Prefer location closer to Zona Rosa (where there is much happening at night, so it's safer to walk around), but I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Loved this Hotel! This was our first trip to Mexico City (my fiance, myself and 2 teenagers - a son and a daughter) and I didn't have a clue as to where we should stay. I did some research on the Internet and decided that the Casa Blanca Hotel had the location and amenities that we were looking for. I would have to say that the property exceeded my expectations, so much so, that we decided to extend our stay from 3 nights to 7 nights (we were spoiled!)We stayed in a 2-room suite with 1 1/2 baths and 2 televisions (which was great for the kids). The rooms and bathrooms were extremely spacious and nicely appointed. The bathrooms were all marble and the full bath had a tub/shower, bidette and double sink. There were 2 queen beds, a twin size sleep sofa and a huge dining table. The room had a safe, 2 closets and plenty of dressers and storage space. The highest nightly rate that we paid for this elegant suite was $115 (USD) and some nights were less.We ate quite a few of our meals in the room, since the room service menu had a good selection and was reasonably priced. The food was great, as was the food in the dining room. (They also have a more formal Mexican Restaurant, but we didn't try it.) There is a roof top pool which has a spectacular view of the City. Off the pool area is a Lounge and full bar that you can hang around in while you swim. One end of the pool is shallow enough to sit in (the water is clean and as warm as bathwater!)and the other end is maybe about 4' deep. The Hotel has a gift shop where we could pick up any of the incidentals that we forgot to pack (there is also a Sanborn's store across the street) and they have computers with Internet access. There is also a cocktail lounge with entertainment on the first floor.The staff was extremely hospitable and friendly. There was always someone on the Front Desk who spoke English. They had 24-hour money exchange and were very helpful in assisting us in arranging tours and transportation. The housekeeping staff was excellent - the rooms and common areas were very clean. I felt very safe staying here as there is always a doorman on duty and plenty of staff roaming around. Although I have read other's comments that their taxis were somewhat expensive, they generally arrange for you to have registered tour guides, rather than regular taxi drivers. The only time that we were dissappointed was when they arranged one of our trips with a regular taxi driver. He drove very fast and aggressive and did not speak English. (He had a license plate that started with L and our AAA Guidebook warns against using taxis that have plates that begin with L.) Also, some of the taxi drivers are open to dealing on their rate (the price of the tours, however, seem to be non-negotiable).Our favorite tour guide/taxi driver was named George. He was very personable and spoke great English. His car wasn't the greatest, but he was very informative and drove safely. I was sick on the tour, so he extended it by an hour and didn't charge us any additional money. The tour (to the Pyramids, the Shrine of Guadeloupe and the Plaza of the 3 Cultures) cost about $85 (USD). It was supposed to be 6 hours long, so that only works out to about $14 per hour, which is not bad, considering that you have a personal tour guide. Ask for George if you go there...you will not be disappointed.If I did this vacation again, the only thing that I would have done differently, would be to take the Turibus tour (double-decker bus) on the first day. This is an excellent way to get acclimated to the area and to figure out which sites you would like to visit. The rates for this 2 1/2 hour tour are about $10 (USD) and about $13.50 on Sundays. There is a bus stop about a block away, in front of the Fiesta Americana Hotel. We also took the regular bus transportation for shorter trips and found them very convenient.Overall, we were extremely pleased with the Casa Blanca Hotel and would return there if we ever visit Mexico City again.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Casa Blanca Our 1st visit to Mexico City and our travel agency booked us into the Casa Blanca after some problems at another hotel and we were delighted. The food at the resturants were good. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The service was good and lots of things to see within walking distance if you like to walk. I would recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>My first choice for Mexico City I was twice in the Casa Blanca and had a great time there. The Staff speaks good english and the resataurants in the hotel are great. Rooms are very spacious and clean. The Zocalo is about 5 minutes by taxi. Do not take a taxi in front of the hotel. Stop a green beetle and insist on using the taxameter.

<Content>Nince Hotel I have stayed at this hotel 3 times so far. If you are used to the comfort of US business hotels, but is more budget minded, this will do just fine. Good restaurants, nicely appointed rooms, good service. So far I haven't had any bad experience with this hotel. If you are in Mexico City for sightseeing, this hotel is within a walking distance to a lot of attractions. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the taxi guys that are usually in front of the hotel tend to over charge you 10-20% more. They are courteous and secure, and certainly very convenient, however. A half block away is a Samborn restaurant, a nice business breakfast/lunch place. In front of the restaurant is a bus stop for the combis that go up and down the Reforma from Hidalgo Metro Station to Chapultepec Park.
