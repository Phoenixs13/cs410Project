<Content>Cheap  After reading some of the reviews for this hotel i had to come back and leave one of my own. we arrived in Amsterdam at 10am it took us 10 minutes to find the hotel and we were allowed to check in early great.Yes the rooms are a bit dated and there is that smell of cannabis in the air but hey your in the dam. overall the rooms were clean, warm and with a 24 hour reception its everything you need for a great base to explore this fantastic city, you are literally with in 5 minute walking distance to everything.The Grasshopper is four doors away.The staff were really helpful they even wake you up an hour and a half before check out time also as we had a late flight home they allowed us to leave our bags in the office until later in the day. The only downside for us were the stairs very steep and windy but again this is just one of the quirky things about all places in AmsterdamI would absolutely recommend this hotel it does what is says cheap and central great for happy days in Amsterdam

<Content>You get what you pay for - clean but not cheerful! The location of the Beursstraat is fabulous it is situated one street behind the start of the RLD, within seconds of leaving the hotel you are in the heart of the RLD. But it really is a budget hotel, and not a hotel to have any expectations of! If you are not bothered where you stay or what you stay in and just want to get your head down for the night then the beursstraat will just about be okay!  despite some of the earlier reviews I did not see any vermin, or get bitten. I have listed what I consider to be the good and bad points of the hotel and hope these will help anyone decide whether or not the Beursstaat is for them!Good points !!1) Clean sheets, pillow case, shower and toilet.2) Can leave luggage after check out, until departure time.3) 24 hour reception4) Location5) Cost - 拢44 for one night - 2 people 6) Pleasant  helpful reception staff.Not so good points!!!1) Hotel possibly on par with a hostel.2) Rooms shabby  run down3) Only enough hot water for one person to shower, soon runs cold4) No heating in rooms, I was so cold I had to sleep in jeans and jumper!5) Rooms and landing areas stink of dope and tobacco.6) Blankets/Bed throws - I doubt have been washed for years.7) Towels provided - 2 face towels, clean but well worn and tatty.8) Some nice person coughing and clearing their throat excessively early in the morning and spitting out of their bedroom window!!!!! (doubt you'd get that at the ritz!)I certainly wouldnt want to pay a lot of money for a one night stay, after all it is only a bed for the night, but you do get what you pay for and personally I wish I'd paid that little bit more, I am sure had I done so the whole experience would have been much nicer. I wouldnt stay at the beurstraat again, I'd much sooner pay an extra 拢30/拢40 and stay somewhere a bit nicer. My sister stayed at the Hoksbergen hotel, just off dam square (about a 5 min walk), she paid just over 拢70 for the one night and in comparison although still very basic it was nicer, perhaps not worth 拢70 but having toured her hotel and room, it was considered a much more comfortable environment! Breakfast provided was apparently basic but okay. Like the Beurstraat though, the shower in her hotel soon ran cold and only sufficient for one person to shower, leaving her all soaped up and having to rinse off in cold water! But if I had to choose out of the two hotels I would much prefer to stay at the Hoksbergen.

<Content>Once again A1! Hotel Beursstraat, as you can see from my last review is fantastic!My partner and I stayed here once again for our short break stay in the city, we love this hotel for a number of reasons first being the location, as it is right smack bang in the centre of all the action, when i say right in the centre of all the action, it is at the back of the Red light district, and 4 buildings away from the famous Grasshopper, safety wise its good as you are only 2 doors away from the local police station! (not that you would need it!!)The 2nd reason that we love this hotel is the price, it is really cheap and a good standard for the price, i know there are a lot of reviews saying that the hotel is dirty and uncomfortable. This hotel is not one to take your nan, mother or anyone that would be fussy in which they stay, i mean the best way to explain it, if you are used to staying at the Hilton hotels ot the marriot PLEASE DONT BOOK HERE! This really is a budget hotel with literally one bed (or 2 if you have a twin of course) and a toilet with shower and of course a toilet!) The hotel itself, hosts a staircase in which is much better in design than most others in the city, if you have stayed at some of the other budget hotels in the area, you will know that by design, the stairs are usually quite steep and quite difficult to master, but the updated stairs here are not too difficult, but are steeper than most british homes stairs.The rooms are clean tidy and comfortable, the only thing that would and could possibly annoy you at this hotel is the bells that seem to chime up until 12 midnight and start again at what i believe to be 6am, once you get used to them its not really an issue and if you have sampled a lot of the local delicatessans you will find that this wouldnt really affect you!The hotel staff are friendly, and will help you in any way they can, and will always give you a friendly greeting when entering or leaving the hotel, they even gave us a knock to make sure we was up on the day of us leaving to cath our plane ( i think this was to make sure we was out of our room at the check out time of 10.30 mind you!!)The hotel itself is very secure and has a buzzer door so that the hotel reception staff let you in at each time you enter the hotel so security wise it is very good.There is a deposit you have to give upon entering the hotel for the first time, which is 10 euro's which is a refundable deposit for you key, which once you check out you get back which is quite usefull as i always use this if i have spent out to get the train home!If you were tinking of staying at this hotel i would ask you the following questions:1: Do you want basic but comfortable accomodation?2: Do you want to be close to the centre of the city?If you have answered yes to the above questions then you will be well suited to this hotel, go for it, dont expect glitz and glamour, you need to expect basic and comfotable!Go the the Dam, go and see the sights and enjoy your stay, dont complain that its not as good as when you last stayed at the Hilton!Enjoy....Dan

<Content>It did the job Me and my boyfriend stayed in Hotel Beursstraat for a total of three nights, and found it did exactly what it said on the tin. We asked for a cheap hotel, and that's what we got, so can't really complain. The room wasn't very big, it consisted of a double bed, and about a foot's space around the bed, and a small room with a bathroom. It was a bit dingy, but we wern't expecting much. The people on recepotion were very helpful, and let us leave our bags in holding on the last day as our flight wasn't until a few hours after check-out. The hotel has a very good location, about one street away from the main strip of the Red-Light district, so central but not too central. Also a short walk from the station.

<Content>Perfect! I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews on here, but after a wonderful stay I had to come back and write a real review!The postiive things: First of all, we had booked a quad room, for a couple and two single people for two nights. We got there an hour before we could check in, but the hotel guys were more than happy to let us leave our luggage there while we went for breakfast (or was it lunch?? *lol*) We got back after 11am, and were told that we could have 2 twin rooms instead of a quad, which was ideal! The rooms were small, yes, but the beds were clean, and we had an ensuite with a lovely hot shower - we were quite prepared to have to share a bathroom but we had our own which was ideal!The peopel there were very helpful - I managed to lock my key in the room ( yes,i know!) and they were happy to come up and let me in with a spare key.It is *perfectly* placed for everything, 5 mins from the station, 5 seconds from the bars and shops and near 2 tram stops (at Centraal and Dam).The negative things:I do admit the stairs are a little steep, but even me with a dodgy knee was able to manage it up 2 flights to the room.Having no food facilities was a bit annoying, as eating out for very meal gets very expensive! Buy/bring cereal and bread and eat it in your room!I would have no qualms whatsoever in staying at this hotel again

<Content>Perfect for our needs I can麓t understand the lousy reviews. What to expect for a one-star-hotel?It麓s perfectly located, it麓s cheap and it麓s clean. The towels are indeed to small, but we did bring our own. Who cares if the rooms are ugly?If you go to Amsterdam to stay in a hotelroom - choose another town!I can highly rekommend to stay on Beursstraat for anyone who likes to travel for the experience.

<Content>More than I expected.... I stayed in the Hotel Beursstraat for three nights with my three friends and it was actually quite good. I read really bad reviews of the place and I was upset before getting there but, when I arrived, it was actually not has bad as I thought it would be鈥?I mean, you only shouldn鈥檛 expect more of what you pay for and it wasn鈥檛 bad at all鈥?The receptionists were nice and helpful. The hotel is very basic but clean and handy鈥?Better than a hostel, at least you don鈥檛 have to share with Tom, Dick and Harry鈥ocation was perfect and, of course it smelled of 鈥榥atural drugs鈥?but God! It鈥檚 Amsterdam!!!鈥?br/>I would definitely recommend it but only to not very fuzzy people.

<Content>Good location, cheap and cheerful Stayed March 07 booked via Internet. The rooms are basic and pillows are a tad lumpy not to mention the stairs are similar to the summit of everest (no lift), but hey its cheap, has plenty of charachter and most importantly is well located. Its a lively area with all the coffee shops, bars, red light district, central station within a few steps from the hotel. Worth getting a day pass from central station to jump on/off metro which is cheap and stops at all the main sights and v cheap. If you want luxury look eleswhere but if you need a place to stay for a couple of days and are on a budget its an ideal base, hot showers and rooms clean although v small. Had a great short break here and the sun was shining...Enjoy !!!! Nikki + Neil G - Manchester

<Content>Central location but very, Very basic! This hotel is in a good central location backing on to the red light district and a stones throw from centraal station and the rest of the sights and sounds of Amsterdam.Its a very basic hotel no frills, facilities or extras, the rooms are tiny and the ensuite even more so. You are provided with 2 tiny towels and thats about it. There is no storage or hanging space for anything!!You have to navigate some very narrow and steep stairs to get to your rooms.You do leave a key deposit of 10 euros but this is given back upon checking out which is by 10.30a.m. They will happily store your luggage for you in a room if you have a later flight, train etc at no extra cost.Amsterdam itself is an excellent city break, easy to get around, public transport second to none and plenty to see and do, the red light district is certainly an eye opener and worth a walk through both day and night.Drinks can vary in price depending on bar a vodka and coke cost from 5 euros to 9.5 euros so worth checking out the prices.Summing up, the hotel is clean in an excellent location but lacks any extras best suited to those on a strict budget or who just wanna bed for the night. Defo not for anyone who likes their creature comforts

<Content>Dreadful stay at Hotel Beursstraat!!!!!! At first glance from the outside, you'd think that this hotel could be a decent one....NOT! Let me itemize the awful experience my hubby and our friends had experienced during our stay here:1. No lift/elevator. The stairs shoot straight up, one missed step and you'll tumble down the stairs. Their idea of a lower floor is 3 flights of steps up. Seriously!2. The front desk will ask you for a E10 deposit for your key (as if you'd run away with anything worth taking from their hotel - wahahah!).3. The rooms are carpeted, but instead of vacuuming, they hose their carpeted floors down with water leaving your floor wet and muddy and nasty, hence the sick smell of mildew.4. The bathroom has plenty of hot water, but be careful to check if they even wiped the toilet bowl clean before letting you in. Our friends bathroom still had the scent of rotting pee in the bowl.5. The towels they left in our room were still WET!!! twice they did this!! i had to ask for a dry, cleaner and bigger towels from the front desk. 6. Their pillows...blechh!!! i had never seen a pillow turned brown from drool stain. Make sure you ask for a fresh pillow case to at least have some protection from nastiness. 7. Their walls are paper thin and you can practically hear people farting or belching from the next door. 8. Although their sign says drugs are not allowed inside the hotel, you'll see smoke and smell dope the moment you step into the front lobby..ironic.9. Make sure you lock your windows before you leave your room. Their windows are huge and are easily accessible from the other guest rooms. So, watch out.10. There's a heater inside the room that somehow turns on by itself, it's scary if you ask me, a heater that's turned on and a wet carpet is not a good combo.

<Content>Refused to stay! With expectations of a simple hotel with a bed and bathroom just to basically sleep in, after 10 minutes we had organised alternative accomodation. As two young Australian girls just touring around Europe we didn't expect much on our budget. we were greeted by the desk staff who found the cartoon on the tv a much higher priority then us arriving to book in. We were treated as though we were more of an inconvenience especially considering we had booked online, and were then ordered (not asked) to pay a deposit for the key. As we walked up the stairs we still remained optimistic that this hotel would be quaint but safe. However, once opening the door to our room we immediately felt unsafe. There was a stale smell coming from the bathroom and the smell of dope was overpowering. (which is expected in Amsterdam but a simple open window could have prevented this) UNTIL we opened the window. we realised that our window opened on to what we think is the roof of the reception below, as did the room across from us. Which we in fact could have walked straight into, hence we felt even more unsafe. We proceeded to actually open the bathroom door to try and air the room. Only to realise that part of the smell was caused by the fact that the toilet had not been flushed. Without sounding like a princess, the smell was so bad that we felt immediately ill. Moving on to the beds, we had a twin room, which meant two tiny beds. They looked dirty, uncomfortable and one of them actually leant against the heater. At the end overall I would never recommend this hotel and have actually made this comment to try and stop other people being put in the same predicament as we were. All I can say is be careful when booking online.

<Content>it is what it says on the packet! We were a party of five just looking for a 'base'. We came across this hotel and the bloke that manned the reception said its just clean and simple and did not offer overpriced extras i.e television, breakfast etc. Very clean and manned 24hrs. Would not hesitate to stay again.

<Content>Travel Light We stayed at this hotel recently and found it ok if you are only staying for a couple of nights. The staff were friendly enough and the location is very central ( 5 minute walk from central station ). There is no lift in the hotel so be prepared for a hike up the staircases which we likened to a climb up the North face of the Eiger only difference is the north face of the eiger was easier to climb.

<Content>READ BEFORE YOU BOOK this hotel is not suitable to anyone who is not stonned. the rooms are cramped and you need to learn to sleep standing up as the beds are a torture device!!advisable not to bring any clothes as there is nowhere to hang or store clothing. dont worry about an alarm call as the nearby church clock will wake you every hour on the hour. if you even think about a shower you need to be under 3 tall as the towel provided will struggle with anything more.
