<Content>Horrible Hotel I stayed here for one night while driving across country the beginning of December, 2008. There were two drunk women next door to me that fought, screamed and yelled, and stood outside my door smoking cigarettes ALL night. I called security 3 times during the night and they were useless. This is the worst Marriott I've ever stayed in (I'm a platinum member with 81 Marriott stays this year). Go elsewhere.

<Content>Bed Bugs! I would definately not recommend this hotel because they have bed bugs! I stayed there 2 weeks ago on October 4th and the morning after I had lots of bites on my fingers and in various other places. And when I returned home I continued to get more bites only to discover that the bugs had gotten into my luggage and are now in my home. I would suggest being VERY cautious before you stay there but the best thing to do would be to find a new hotel.

<Content>Good Standard Hotel I stayed here for business. This is directly across the road from Hilton Anatole and is sort of tucked away behind the highway. 5 min drive will get you to a lot of good restaurants. Perfect nice quiet place to stay for work travel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel with Really Helpful Staff We found this hotel by calling the 1-800 number for Marriott when our other hotel turned out to be less than expected.This Marriot hotel is very well located. It is right off the highway to get to downtown Dallas, and a short drive away from House of Blues (which was a great place to snag a late night dinner!).The rooms, although not big, were clean and comfortable.But, the reason I will definitely come back is the incredibly great staff at the front desk. They were all friendly and welcoming from the start, and were happy to help us with any questions we had. The hotel has detailed, printed directions for all the major attractions in Dallas, and the staff is happy to help you print off mapquest or googlemap directions to anywhere else you need to go.The business center at the hotel was very handy and helpful -- with two computers and a printer. Every room is hooked up with WiFi as well. We were very satisfied with our stay and will definitely be back!

<Content>It's fine Stayed at the Courtyard because the Renaissance was completely booked. Not particularly impressed but not disappointed, since it was business travel. The restaurant was rather nice and so was the lobby bar.

<Content>Bad hotel. Bad hotel. Bad, bad, bad hotel. This ranks as one of the worst Courtyards I've ever checked into. And, as a Platinum Rewards member, I stay in many Courtyards.When I pulled into the parking lot, the thing that struck me was the number of signs warning parkers not to leave anything in the car. Now, that is good advice. But the number or signs screamed that there is a security issue at this hotel.The lobby has a full restaurant and bar, with activity that made it seem more like a frat house than a business hotel. The check-in process would have gone much faster if the person behind the desk had skipped the heavy sales pitch for the hotel's restaurant. The elevator carpet was filthy and there were messages scratched into the doors. The room was average Courtyard, but not quite as clean. My bedding request - written into the reservation, subject of a couple phone calls, and confirmed at check-in - was not done. Even a trip from housekeeping didn't get it done. And my wake-up call the next morning was given three times, until I called the front desk and demanded the calls stop. There are other hotels in the area. The Sheraton shares a parking lot. Do yourself a favor and try one of the other places.

<Content>Great little marriott Spent one night at this property recently and I have nothing but compliments. It's a Courtyard with the standard amenitites, including a workout room, outdoor pool and a little market in the lobby so that you can buy snacks. In addition to the breakfast buffet in the mornings, the lobby restaurant also serves some dinner items. (I did not eat there.) There is a Denny's 2 buildings over. The staff were very pleasant and I enjoyed being able to use the free internet. My room was standard marriott set up, very clean and everything in working order. If you are looking for a less expensive alternative, the courtyard is almost connected to the Fairfield Marriott, which I also stayed in for a few dollars less for a few night. According to the front desk staff, the properties are co-owned, so guests are welcome to use any of the amenities in either. If you stay here, you should go across the street to view the Hilton Anatole - it is a huge (HUGE) hotel with a interesting art collection. The concierge will supply you with a brochure and map of same. The Anatole also has a lounge with an amazing view, have an expensive drink or just a cheap look at the skyline! (Also has several restaurants.)

<Content>A good 3-star hotel - but that's it Recent gushing reviews over this Courtyard near the Dallas city center seem to focus primarily on cleanliness (extra clean, immaculate) and perhaps value. While this is an average representative for Courtyards in general, I don't think it's the #4 hotel in the Dallas metro area.This Courtyard has been refurbed in the current Courtyard room scheme, although they retained the old mirrored sliding doors on the closets and the original (c. 1990) tile and surround in the bathroom. More significantly, the HVAC is quite loud; corridors and hallways have carpet that isn't being cleaned regularly; exterior entrances are worn, with painting and other maintenance needed; the elevators are slow, clunky, and have significant scratches and near-grafitti on the inside doors; and there are disconcerting Watch Your Car signs posted by the Dallas Police at several spots in the parking lot.All of this is easily forgiveable at a price point of oh, say, $120 a night; but at $169 a night, the value proposition is below average, especially when a comparable Courtyard (Central Expressway) is $149 and the nearby Renaissance and Marriott Suites full-service properties are $229. Unless you have reservations at Medieval Times (which is adjacent), there are better Marriott options nearby and less expensive Courtyard options about the same distance from the city center.

<Content>Great hotel have stayed there twice! I love this hotel. The place is extra clean and was 2 years ago when I first stayed there. The staff is great and will do anything to help you. I travel alot and spend about 50-60 nights a year in hotels. This place is what a nice affordable hotel should be like.

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful! Everything is absolutely wonderful! This hotel was recently remodeled including a starbucks  big screen television  bar area in the lobby. The rooms are top-notch  have wonderful views from all rooms (I've stayed here several times). I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a hotel with everything for a price that's great! Also has free high-speed internet (usually costs 9.95/24 hour usage period).
