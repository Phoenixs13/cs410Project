<Content>Don't Even Consider This Hotel Would NOT recommend this hotel. Booked a family room for 140 SGD (Can't believe they would price their rooms as such). Luckily we had not paid as when we got to the room it was without functioning air conditioning (90F), it was dark despite lighting, it had no windows, exposed electrical wiring/cords were noted taped to the walls and it had a very dirty looking bathroom. The front desk staff were very unhelpful and appeared surprised that we may point out these deficits. We were able to walk around the corner to the Parklane hotel which for 40 more SGD were able to find us a room on a Saturday night. Little India itself is a fantastic place.....Post Ambassador hotel all was well.

<Content>Cockroach infested hovel ! Hotel is not how i would describe this disgraceful property. It is absolutely filthy, and in need of URGENT refurbishment. The staff are unhelpful , disinterested and appear to regard guests as an intrusion. Our ROOM if that is the correct term was tiny, perhaps 5 meters X 3 meters with the bed crammed into a corner to allow access to one side. No table,chair or room to put a suitcase - i refused to hang clothes in the free standing wardrobe. The bathroom was like a galley, my knees were up against the wall while seated on the toilet, had to sit to one side. No ventilation / window in the shower cubicle, which was dirty and smelly. The hot water lasted all of 60 seconds, and there was precious little room to dry yourself with a towel that had holes in it. On returning to the room in the evening we were greeted by scurrying cockroaches over an inch long. on close inspection we found other dead ones presumeably dispatched by previous guests. After our first night the TV had no reception, i reported this to staff who advised it was a network problem. A quick visit to the nearby Mustafer center confirmed many different channels working including one of the two provided in our room. A second complaint failed to produce the promised maintenance man and we retired early, bored with little else to do. I rarely if ever use in room mini bars and did not do so here. However on checkout the reception claimed we had used one bottle of water and demanded payment . i refused ! Our stay was during the Singapore Grand Prix and we had little or no choice of hotel. All acceptable establishments either booked out or beyond a resonable budget. Had i not already paid i would have gone back to the airport and spent the night at the AMBASSADOR TRANSIT HOTEL, - a very different proposition.Travellers beware this Doss house is DISGUSTING ! !

<Content>Unreliable My friend had pre-reserved this hotel from Japan, we turned up at night 3 girls and they turned us away saying the hotel was full but that we could go to their sister hotel - the Aspinal's hotel.On arrival the place looked like a flea pit! so bad that i requested to see the room before payment.I wouldn't let an animal stay in that hotel ( I will review the Aspinal and attach picture), surfice to say we left and luckily found a clear new hotel (also in little India) called Hotel 81 - basic but clean and good service.Pearl, Yoshiko  Yumiko
