<Content>Convenient hotel for further travelling by bus After a long flight from Europe, this hotel is convenient as it is not far from the airport (by taxi). And as we planned to travel by bus to Quer茅taro by bus, Brasilia is a good choice because it is only 7 minutes by foot from Terminale Norte. However, I wouldn't stay here to visit Mexico City but advise to rather stay in a hotel in the historical center as the environment of this hotel is not so spectacular. Besides, rooms can be noisy and I would recommand to ask for a room that not faces the street. We paid 380 mexican pesos for a double room.

<Content>Hard bed, noisy room, handy to the bus terminal A friend, who's generally pretty knowledgeable about Mexico, recommended that I stay here because of its proximity to the North Terminal. While he was right about the convenience of the location, he didn't mention that the Brasilia may have the hardest mattresses and pillows in the hemisphere. In addition, there was no remote for the TV and the lighting next to the beds was nsufficient for reading. To top it all off, I was in a third floor room right above the street and the traffic noise was maddening. As a consequence of the noise and the uncomfortable bedding, it took me forever to fall asleep, despite having been travelling for more than 12 hours. The only good news was that the restaurant was OK, it was a very easy walk to the bus station (even with luggage) and the room only cost about $45.

<Content>Super value great location. This hotel is located just a few steps from the northern bus station (Terminal del Norte) and the metro is there as well, putting all attractions in easy reach. Buses for Teotihuacan leave from Terminal Norte. Hotel is clean and comfortable, in another location this hotel would cost $100.00 per night. As it is the rate for a single is only about $18.00. There is a full service restaurant, and a Bar which often has live music.
