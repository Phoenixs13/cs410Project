<Content>nice  Just got back from 6 beautiful August days in Berlin. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Berlin, whether for the first time or for a return visit. The location is great, with the metro just outside and only about 15 minutes walk to Kurfurstendam. Nice and quiet neighborhood with a lot of restaurants around the hotel.From Schoenefeld airport you need around 45 min. with S9 to Zoologische Garten and then you should change to U9 for 2 more station but it worth; the location and the hotel are great!The room was clean and comfortable, not very large but enough taking account we didn鈥檛 spend a lot of time in the room; the breakfast was very substantial and the staff were very nice and helpful.I liked it very much and I'd definitely go back again.

<Content>Efficeint  Purchased deal of E-Bay, quite a result 2 nights plus free pass for 2 people including breakfast. Situated 2 stops from ZOOGARDEN and U Barn train 3 minutes walk from hotel. Good hotel clean tidy welcoming apeared to be used by older German travellers for a weekend break, good breakfast, cant fault the hotel or its efficient staff, would happley return and stay a week or even more. Do get your Berlin Card its worth the purchase price and then travell on either the 100 or 200 bus which cover the main sight seeing places in Berlin. Great city my secound visit and will come back again. Although the pound to euro rate is poor Berlin is still good value for a capital city and with so much history.

<Content>It's OK - Nothing to rave about This was one of the hotels I stayed in with the group I was hosting and for the price, it's satisfactory. PROS - it's located about five minutes walk from the U-Bahn and only two stops from the KuDamm. The bed is comfortable and there鈥檚 a normal working TV.CONS - no Internet (free or otherwise), no bathroom amenities (except 2 shower caps), and no Internet caf茅s nearby. There are restaurants when you exit the building to the right but I wouldn't exactly call it a lively neighborhood.

<Content>This just In... Just back from a pleasant stay in Berlin and a very pleasant stay at The Quuens Hotel. Check in was painless and polite (room was on the fourth floor). Room was very clean and well presented also the bathroom/shower was spotless. Beds were comfy apart from rather flacid pillows so if anybody that has any clout at Best Western is reading this...Did not avail ourselves of the 12 Euro breakfast as we thought it a little expensive so just used the cafe across the street metioned by another reviewer for coffee and croissants.Although the hotel is not in the centre (Mitte) of Berlin it is VERY easy to get around town as there is a U-Bahn (metro/tube) 100 yards or so from the front door of the hotel which if you have a Welcomecard (a tourist vistor all zone all forms of transport pass) will connect you quickly and without fuss to anywhere you need to get to.Just whatever you do do not forget to get any type of travel ticket validated by punch machine (obvious what you need to do and they are located both inside and outside all stations and some bus stops).We did and got slapped with an 80 Euro fine...doh! So get a ticket and get it stamped! It's no good otherwise.Anyway back to the hotel. Staff were without fail pleasant and helpful.Good Stuff.

<Content>Average Hotel I have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Best Western Queens Hotel, 7 - 10 July 2006, whilst visiting Berlin for the World Cup.The hotel is situated in a nice quiet locale but with in walking distance of U9 Underground.Breakfast is buffet style and plentiful but of pretty basic fare.My biggest gripe is that there is no air conditioning in the bedrooms and in fine sunny weather the bedrooms, paricularly on the front of the hotel, become unbearably hot.I called on a couple of occasions to reception who stated that they only had a small number of fans which were in other rooms.The general demeanour of the reception staff was quite dismissive  disinterested.I will give this one a miss in future.

<Content>nice but out of the way Just back from 4 nights in Berlin. Queens Hotel is very nice, we had a large triple room, very comfortable. Great buffet breakfast. Helpful staff. Only problem is that it is not located near anything except an Ubahn station and a great organic food market. Because Berlin's train system is so excellent it was easy to get around but I would have preferred being closer to any of the main tourist areas. Berlin is a fabulous city and very easy to navigate. Queens Hotel is great if you don't mind always taking the train.

<Content>New Best Western My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Queens Hotel for 5 nites and I would recommend it to anyone. It has just joined the BW chain in Sept. and it is rated as a 4 star hotel.Although not right in the center of the tourist scene, it is only a short U-bahn ride to the Ku'damm (U9 - from the Ku'damm, the hotel is two stops south at Guntzelstr.) The hotel is just around the corner from the station - about a one minute walk.We liked that it was a smaller hotel. The staff was multi-lingual and very accomodating. The rooms were modest in size but had a very nice modern bathroom (we had shower only.) The area around the hotel was primarily residential but there were a number of local restaurants nearby. We didn't choose to have breakfast at the hotel (an additional 12 euros per person) so instead ate at a small bakery/cafe across the street. The nature of the neighborhood also was a benefit since we were there before the heating season and needed to have the windows open. Being a residential area, it was generally pretty quiet at night making it easier to sleep. (Hotel is on a corner. One side of hotel is on a moderately busy street = Guntzelstr. Other street side is much less busy.) We booked through the BW website - price: 75 Euros/night (not including breakfast)

<Content>A real find Splendid little hotel in the pleasant Wilmersdorf/Charlottenberg district. Kathe Kolwitz Musuem very close. Quite a way from the city centre but not a problem given Berlin's excellent public transport (U-Bahn just around the corner). Not all rooms have baths if you need a soak after the end of a busy day.

<Content>Terrific Place! This is a great place to stay in Berlin. The rooms are clean, staff helpful and multilingual, and the location good on a quiet street one block from an underground station. The breakfast is fantastic, and everyone found something they loved. It's a bit of a walk to the zoo and shopping, but public transport is a breeze. We would definitely stay here again.
