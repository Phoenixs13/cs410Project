<Content>Nice hotel, bad staff This hotel is lovely and situated in perfect distance of AlexanderPlatz and there is a very handy U-Bahn just outside the front door. The rooms are lovely, comfortable and clean not huge but big enough, not all rooms have a bath so if you want one you should ask but the bathroom itself is spacious and well lit with lots of mirrors.The staff however are terribly rude and unhelpful. When we checked in we weren't told simple things such as check out time, breakfast timings (especcially as we went over a bank holiday as breakfast time is different to normal). We weren't told about being able to use the bar at the sister hotel over the road and we weren't told to bring our guest passes with us otherwise they grumble at you when you ask for your key back after being out.When checking out we were told that the luggage store was full and they had no where to store our bags, although when we pressed the point they told us we could use the luggage store over the road, why were we not automatically given that option? Also we asked reception to book us a cab to the airport although when we got back to our hotel after being out for the morning we were told someone else had taken our car and she had failed to book us another one!!! We were there at the time we had requested the car for after all...Also the restaurant at the hotel, whilst supplying very yummy indian food (no onion bhajis though!) the service is terrible. We waited about an hour for our dinner, thankfully we weren't in a rush. After dinner we stayed in the restaurant for another couple of hours (as there is no bar in the hotel that is ever used) and we weren't asked once if we wanteed another drink. Everytime we beckoned the waiter over to ask for a drink he acted as if we were causing him great difficulty!and these are just some of the problems we encountered with the staff........!!To round it off I entirely recommend the location and the hotel rooms etc but not the service they provide, maybe try the hotel over the road??!!P.S if planning on going over new year be careful of everyone throwing fireworks in the street. Even out of their apartment windows! Scary!

<Content>Good quite spot This is a lovely hotel to explore Berlin from but being far enough off the beaten track to be as quite as a church mouse at night. The hotel claims to have a bar but saw no eveidence of it though its sister hotel across the roads does so if you have young kids and you want to sit and have a night cap before going to bed this may not be for you.Rooms are fine not large but certainly big enough, again very quiet and spotless clean.

<Content>So convenient If you are looking for a hotel 20m from an U-Bahn station but in a quiet part of former East Berlin then this is the place for you. The public transport in Berlin is second to none and this hotel is ideal to benefit from that. Rooms are comfortable and breakfast is plentiful setting you up for a day's sightseeing. When we were there between Christmas and New Year the bar was closed although it looked as if it had been closed for a while. You can use the bar facilites across the road in the sister hotel so not really an inconvenience. There was an Indian restaurant attached to the hotel which is fine if you can't be bothered to go out in the evening and we used it on arrival day for that reason. Good selection of restaurants in the Nicholai quarter which is a short walk away. But the location and the ease of use of the U-Bahn were the highlights for me.

<Content>Will certainly go back to the Henriette! We booked the Hotel Henriette through the Berlin tourism office's site and were a bit dubious as to what kind of hotel we'd get for 67 euros. But it was only for one night, the other reviews on Trip Advisor were good, so we'd go for it. During the week, it seems to be much more expensive, so we came to the conclusion that it's primarily a business hotel that offers great weekend deals.What a lovely surprise! As others have pointed out, it's very well located, with a U-bahn station right outside, and easy walking distance to all the main sights of East Berlin. Our welcome was very friendly and professional. Our room was a decent size, not huge, spotlessly clean and well-equipped (hairdryer, fan, kettle, minibar etc). Because of its location, it was nice and quiet. The hotel itself was tastefully and elegantly decorated. When we were leaving, the receptionist was extremely helpful, even printing out timetables from the web to make sure we caught the right train to the airport. All in all, I'd highly recommend this hotel. I filled out their in-room questionnaire and was delighted to receive a follow-up message in the mail a few days later, inviting us to come and stay again. We certainly will.

<Content>Excellent location An excellent choice for a city break over Easter. Easy to get to from Shoenefeld airport as Ubahn station outside the hotel (change at Alexanderplatz) - open all hours, so late arrival not a problem. Upgraded to a room with 'tea-station' (although kettle only worked in our room), view of canal and interesting skyline. Good space and decor. Very good buffet breakfast - incredible range of teas!Location - superb. We chose to walk everywhere (partly to keep warm as it was cold with snow showers) but also because it is the best way to see the city. However, the transport system is cheap and effective. All main tourist locations within relatively easy walking distance.... and it is flat! Near to hotel- reasonable range of tourist restaurants nearby if you basically want to eat basic good German fayre, otherwise you may need to travel further afield (we didn't try the Indian restaurant attached to the hotel, but it was always busy and had reasonable menu).On our last day, cases kept in locked cupboard all day as we had late night plane to catch.Lovely, friendly staff.

<Content>A central Hotel although in the East Going to a new destination and knowing little about it makes booking an hotel difficult and can be worrying. As our son is living in Berlin he recommended the Dreag Henriette as it was the closest hotel to his apartment. He had not been inside but was told that the hotel was little known being in the East and off the beaten tourist map, but value for money.It is certainly value for money and compares well with UK hotel prices. The Hotel is not the Ritz but is comfortable, extremely clean, excellent breakfast, good and attentive service and staff speak enough English to understand and be understood. The only adverse comment I can make is that the coffee and tea supplies in the room were not replenished without asking and unfortunately there was not enough information about the room facilities and how to use them.Staff were frindly but not pushy, a good point.Bearing in mind the closeness to the U-bahn, twenty yards would be too far, the hotel suddenly becomes very accessible and convenient to all central points. Two stops to Alexanderplatz and Berlin becomes a smaller city.If we return to Berlin, the Henriette wold be first choice, but I think that it is becoming known and seems to enjoy good occupancy, which would mean early booking.Highly recommended!

<Content>Good value and well located but poor decoration The Derag Henriette is well located in East Berlin, near the main museums in a quiet (maybe too much?) area. However, it is just at a subway station which makes it a good point to discover the rest of the city (Berlin has one of the best public transport system I ever experienced). The staff is quite nice, but they did not anticipate our needs. Arriving late in the evening, our room was very hot due to an external temperature of 30C all day long and we realised that there was no fixed A/C unit available. However, the next day they came to fit in a mobile A/C unit which changed a lot the comfort. Otherwise, I found both the room and the bathroom a bit small for this category of hotel, but everything was new, very clean, soundproof and operational. Breakfast was good. The decoration is very much on the conservative side with a lot of very ugly and cheap looking paintings. But it still was a good value at 93 鈧?per night for 2 with breakfast

<Content>Comfortable hotel, good location The hotel is of modest size, spotlessly clean, with courteous and efficient reception staff. My room was more than adequate, with a mini-bar, small kitchen area (microwave, sink, one or two stovetop burners, cookware), a well-appointed bathroom, and even a tiny balcony. And it was quiet.When I wanted to make a drink in my room I was unable to find ice, and was surprised that the front desk could not provide any. Since the Henriette does not have a regular bar it was suggested that I go to the bar at the related Derag Grosser Kurfuerst directly across the street. This minor inconvenience I simply note, since it did not detract from my comfortable stay at the Henriette.When I arrived in Berlin I took the S-Bahn from Schonfeld train station (the Hauptbahnhof having been temporarily knocked out by the big storm) to Alexanderplatz then, not really knowing exactly where I was, I took a short taxi ride to the my hotel. It turns out that the Derag Henriette is located just a few yards from an U-Bahn stop, and only a few blocks from Unter Den Linden.It was a pleasant walk to the Berliner Dom, and thence to the Brandenburg Gate, and I suppose it would have been not a bad walk back to Alexanderplatz, had I wanted to do that.

<Content>Ideal Situation I have stayed in Berlin many times but on this occasion needed an hotel which was Central...We use Easyjet to fly so this hotel came up on their website and after reading the description of the facilities, I decided to take the family for the Christmas Markets weekend..Our main disappointment was that the hotel did not help us with a smoking room with bath as requested via the Easyjet site and reception categorically told us that Easyjet had not passed on our requests...Yet the hotel were able to supply us with a third request from the same e-mail which was for adjoining rooms for my family.Otherwise it is an ideal jumping off point for all of Berlin since it is next to a U-Bahn which took us everywhere we wanted.The rooms were nice an warm and we slept well before going down for a great selection off the breakfast barAcross the road is the brother hotel (The Kurfurster) which had quality restaurant , fitness center and a bar which makes a change from the Henriette..........In summary, I can recommend the Henriette as a suitable hotel for a sightseeing visit to Berlin

<Content>Great hotel so near the U Bahn Booked this hotel on hotels.com and it was fab. I knew very little about it only from what I have seem in the reviews. Very convienent for the U-Bahn and 2 stops from the S Bahn in Alexanderplatz. We checked in late 10:30 pm and the hotel restaurant was still open and they did room service. Repeption was friendly and efficient. We did not have breakfast included so we did not have it . Lots of facilities in the room. Just watch no Air conditioning I forgot to look for it when I was booking. We had to keep the windows open so I would look for it in future for travelling in the summer.

<Content>A Nice Find I had wanted to find a nice, somewhat affordable hotel in Berlin for a recent trip, and wasn't at all sure where to go. All I knew was that I wanted to stay in East Berlin. I stumbled on the Hotel Henriette in a guide book, and it ended up being a very good choice. It's not as drop dead spectacular as some of the new modern chain hotels in Postdamerplatz, but it was certainly more intimate, and the staff took good care of me. Although the surrounding area may feel a bit out of the way, the hotel is actually in a very central location, on the Spee River virtually across from the Museum Island with its many museums and the Berliner Dom. The hotel itself is relatively small and modern (and as yet undiscovered by Americans), but it fits with the look and feel of the eastern half of the city. My room had built-in furniture (a bit like a ship) and was on the somewhat small side, like most European hotel rooms, but it was very comfortable and had tons of drawer space and all modern amenities. It also faced the river; a nice bonus (I suggest requesting a river view). The hotel has a nice restaurant and bar, and offers an excellent free breakfast. The staff were courteous and helpful.I would recommend the Hotel Henriette to anyone looking for a bit of (affordable) calm in the midst of this sprawling, ever-changing city.
