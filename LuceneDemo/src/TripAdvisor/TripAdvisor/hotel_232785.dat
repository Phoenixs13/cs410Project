<Content>Good location, but not much else My wife and I stayed at Hotel L'Alguer for two nights in December 2007. We booked the hotel through Priceline.com, and paid about $60 per night.The hotel is in a good location, only a few minutes walk from the Collblanc station on the L5 metro line. The metro is cheap and easy to use, and getting into the city centre (Ramblas, etc) requires one change and takes around 15 minutes.The area around the hotel is quite lively too, with many shops and places to eat (including McDonalds, though this was closed on Saturday).The front-desk staff were helpful, providing information and maps. There's also an internet-connected computer in the lobby, which is free to use for guests.Location aside though, the hotel was disappointing. The entire hotel only has three rooms with double beds, which are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, so there's a relatively high chance you'll be stuck with two single beds.The rooms are small, and feel quite dark and gloomy with the lighting. There are windows and blinds, but we kept these closed as it was cold outside.The bathroom is small, and the shower was awkward to use. The water temperature had to be adjusted using the hot and cold taps, and a turn too much of either tap would result in scalding hot or freezing cold water. It gets easier after a day or two of use. The TV was small, only had one channel, and that was in spanish. The remote control didn't work either, though with a one-channel line-up, it wasn't really needed anyway.Although I probably wouldn't stay here again, it's not bad for a budget conscious traveller in town for a few days who isn't planning to spend much time in the hotel.

<Content>Basic but clean My husband and I stayed at Hotel L'Alguer in Barcelona for 3 nights in September 2006. Although it was adequate, I would describe it as a hostel rather than hotel. The room was very small but had all of the essentials and the bed was comfortable and everything was clean.It is located quite far away from the main city centre but has a metro station around the corner which has a direct line to the centre (takes about 10 mins).I would recommend this hotel for those on a tight budget or students.Also, we had booked it as bed and breakfast but when we arrived they said it was on a bed only basis and therefore had to buy breakfast each day.
