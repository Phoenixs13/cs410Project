<Content>Neat and Clean Hotel, Down In "THE District" This is a neat and clean hotel down in the Geylang district of Singapore. I stayed here one night in May 2007, for a lay over of flights on my way up to Vietnam. I believe the room cost me $ 35 U.S.D. per night. It's a nice little hotel. Like all of the Fragrance hotel chain's hotels in the Geylang district, they are built for speed(rented by the hour) not comfort. If your not familiar with Singapore, the Geylang district, is the red light district. Usually, which is also the case at the Sunflower. there are no top sheets on the beds, only bottom sheets, and only one pillow. The rooms are small but adequate, the queen size bed takes up most of the room. The bathroom has a toilet and a shower, no tub. One night stand. No dressers. No closets. You can get a top sheet and blanket at the front desk, if you ask nicely. The room is air conditioned, and has a small 19 color T.V. mounted on the wall. There is no security safe in the room. There may be a lot of hallway activity, with guests coming back to their rooms with their newly aquired girlfriends. But, if your dog tired, and just want to sleep, while catching up with your jet lag, between flights, than nothing I described up above matters. The price is right, and, so is the location(to the airport-15 minutes). Nobody bothers you, as long as you don't bother nobody. Enjoy the experience. It's neat, clean, and friendly. I give it 2 and a half stars.
