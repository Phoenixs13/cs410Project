<Content>A great Hotel I have stayed at this hotel a total of 8 times in the last 2 years. I keep going back as the Facilites are good (I only require a basic, clean base), the staff could not be more helpful, and the hotel is in a great position.If you need a genuine sensible review of this hotel then please get in touch.

<Content>Nice but noisy I spent 2 nights in the hotel during the week staying in a single room. The room was clean and tidy and all the furniture was in good condition. The bathroom was clean and in fully working order. A little pack next to the sink contained toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. The breakfast area was small but clean and served the usual standard euro selection of cereal, cheese and cold meat. The only downside to the hotel was how little soundproofing my room had. I could hear people going up and down stairs and shutting doors etc although some of this has to do with fellow guests lack of consideration.The hotel location is futher from the train station (Sants) then the website suggests. They say 500m but I'd say it's closer to 1000m! It's a 15/20 min walk to the top of La Rambla.All in all it was a pleasent stay and I would recommend it for a 1 or 2 night stay.

<Content>over-rated As this Hotel is a 4 star, i was expecting just a little bit better than average. The reception staff were polite and friendly enough, but the rooms were in need of a refurbish. Breakfast was in a tiny room not big enough for all the guest that were staying, and the staff did'nt seem to know what they were doing. Everything was a little bit tired, shower head kept falling off the wall and spinning all around the bathroom, soaking everything in sight, towells were almost see through, no soap or other accessories. I have found better in 2 star hotels. The location is not in the least bit handy. It says 10mins from the main shopping area, but 1 hour later we finally hit the main shops (Zara). Overall not good value for money, but as a 2.5 or at most 3 star it would be fine.

<Content>Really Good Stayed at Century Park Hotel for 4 days and really enjoyed our stay. When we first arrived, we asked for a double room, but wasn't too happy with the layout since two single beds were placed together. But they were more than happy to change to room. Rooms were kept clean, mini bar available, bathroom very clean. Staff was really nice and helpful and the breakfast was satisfying

<Content>A Little Gem Stayed at Century Park 5th to 8th April 2005 with my wife and 12 year old son. Had Free child and Free breakfast deal - excellent, no hidden problems. Lovely clean hotel, just refurbished, a bit basic but very comfortable and friendly. On a busy road so expect some noise at the front, but not too bad at night. Rooms are on the small side but well equipped with aircon, TV, mini bar, safe, hairdryer, and good marble bathroom. You have to walk 3 or 4 blocks (10 Minutes max) to Metro but the area seems safe - we had no problems even at night. Bus stops very close to hotel, the 41 takes you to Las Ramblas, Port Olympic, the zoo etc so very convenient. Breakfast is great, cold buffet but lots of choice of cereals, meats, cheese, pastries and cakes, and it's free. Well worth considering this hotel if you are on a budget. The staff are really helpful and speak good english. Try the Hotelclub website Last Minute Deals for the best price. We did and no complaints. Enjoy your trip and make sure you ride the cable cars across the harbour - great fun.

<Content>Safe, quiet, clean Don't let the forst reviewer put you off!Small hotel in a residential area. View is of three small apartment buildings, one Art Deco, one Art Nouveau, one modern, across the street - charming and you can peek in the windows. Hotel is currently being renovated so there is some noise but not enough to interfere with a pleasant stay. Small but well arragnged room. Again, another great Spanish marble bathroom with big towels and good water pressure.There was a growing wet spot in the carpeting, under the window desk counter that gave the room a slightly mouldy smell. We credited it to the renovation work and constant rain of the last week because the room was immacuately clean otherwise. We reported it to the front desk and they seemed surprised and concerned. When we returned that evening, while it was still there, it was apparant they had been working on correcting.Small breakfast rooms ( temporary I think during renovation) but very nice/ample seelction of breads, pastries, juice, fresh fruit, coffees/tea, yoghurt, cheese, meats and wonderful sesame seed whole wheat rolls.Metro stops 3/4 blocks in any direction.Barcelona is a beautiful city!

<Content>u gotta go!! I had booked Century Park hotel before i saw this website and when i read the previous review i was a bit scared. However, I m here writing this so that no one goes there with the same impression that i did/ Its a lovely hotel - nice ppl, they speak great english - they have great food and i have never been in a cleaner hotel room. Just wanted to let you know and set things straight! My holiday was great and the hotel was one of the leading factors. Thank you Century Park!
