<Content>Loved this Hotel Stayed here in May 08, and had a fantastic time. We arrived very late and were given a very small room (which for a night or two, would be ok), we came straight back down and were moved the following day...no problems.The staff were fantastic, the guys on recepton could'nt do enough for us - very friendly. The hotel is a little further back, from the very centre of Barcelona, but is no more than a pleasant 20 min stroll, or just round the corner was a tube stop.This is only a small hotel so has quiet a nice feel to it, there is a bar but was not always open.FAB hotel for people that will be out exploring Barcelona. When we went this hotel was much better value than other similar standard hotels.

<Content>Fine for long weekend Ok hotel. Room comfortable but on small side but just our bad luck as friends in party had much larger rooms. OK location but not right in the middle of the action. Bar at end of road excellent for breakfast.

<Content>Lovely hotel - shame about the beds Stayed 4 nights at NH Master in Barcelona. Was very new looking and reception were very pleasant and helpful. Some staff had limited english. The room was very modern - had a window that opened onto a central light area with no views at all. Did not worry us. Airconditioning was hard to work out, so spent a few nights quite hot. The worse was the bed situation - as they were singles pushed together. With no clasp to keep the beds together it was not very romantic! I will email and complain to the NH group (as there are many hotels) but will want to double check this next time. Towels and linen were all clean and new - would recommend highly but watch for the bed situation. Location was ok...although next time I would pick a hotel near the metro Jaume - as we walked down that way for all the better restaurants.

<Content>Nice Stay, Shame About The Map! In our experience the NH chaim is one that you can trust.The hotels are always clean and effecient and the complimentary toiletries are a nice touch too.That said the hotel didn't really get off to a good start with us.First of all the map on the hotel's e-mailed confirmation to us gave the impression that it was a mere 500 metres from the main railway station - that was not the case and caused a degree of anxiety for my wife and I. We ended up getting a 5 minute taxi ride.In the light of day the hotel proved to be a five minute walk from the metro or around the corner from a bus stop.By the time we arrived (9:30 pm), both the hotel bar and resturant had closed, so we had to resort to room service for something to eat as we were both exhausted by then.From then on however, the hotel performed ok. The room was spacious and the bathroom was lovely, although judging by our experience it must be siad that the walls are paper thin!We also used their laundry service, and although expensive, they did a very good job and presented the clothes beautifully.

<Content>I just don't get it.... We stayed here for one night in Oct....were supposed to stay for more, but upon checking in, they could not give us a non-smoking room eventhough we had requested it months before. We found the front desk staff to be very un-friendly and the room not very comforatable. The walls were very thin and we could hear the people in the room next to us clearly - it was as though they were in the room with us. While the hallways and the room seemed as though they had been renovated, the bathroom was in need of some attention. Fixtures were old and not very clean. Also, we had a drainage pipe in our room beside the bed and you could constantly hear water going through it. As for the location, we found that it was a bit off the beaten path for us. The day we checked in, we walked down to Las Ramblas and it was about a 20 minute walk. Needless, to say, we checked out the next day and moved to a different hotel. I should also mention that although the hotel says on its site that they have WiFi, it is not free and the interent in the lobby is also not free.

<Content>Comfortable and modern A very comfortable and modern hotel. Was quite close to local attractions - we walked everywhere - to Las Ramblas, Sagrada Familia Cathedral and Gruell Park.Staff was very helpful and the rooms were very clean. Bathrooms even had disposable toothbrushes and sponges which you could use! It was nice to return to the nicely decorated room and have a pleasant shower in a well maintained bathroom after a long day of walking!Breakfast was excellent - loads of food to choose from.I totally recommend this

<Content>Great value in Barcelona We stayed at tehe NH Master for a weekend in December. It was not my first time in Barcelona and I have stayed at other hotels. I really liked the NH Master because it is central but not in the middle of the very touristic areas, so it is a bit quieter. It is a nice walk through the residential area towards the Plaza Catalunya or the Passeig de Gracia. The rooms are simple and modern and the bathroom is large and clean, I always enjoy the little shampoos and toiletries they have for free. The price is great compared to more expenisive hotels I stayed at before and were not as nice.

<Content>Very convenient hotel close to the city centre I really enjoyed our stay at NH Master. The rooms are quite large, immaculate, with wooden flooring and modern furnishing. The bathroom was big and extremely clean. This is a fairly large hotel which may seem a little bit anonymous, but staff was generally friendly and helpful. The hotel is about 7 minutes walk from the nearest underground station, otherwise it is possible to walk to the Ramblas in about 20/30 minutes. All in all, a very clean hotel close to the city centre.
