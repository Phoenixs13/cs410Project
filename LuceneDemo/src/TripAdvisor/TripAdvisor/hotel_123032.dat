<Content>Best In imediate area! We stayed in one of 2 suites first. Was clean, and nice with frig, micro, and couch for $75 plus tax a night. The next time we came they were black topping the parking lot so we stayed at a couple other places in the immediate area. There are some really SCARY, cheaper places on Hwy 99. We were delighted when we could get in the parking lot again!!! This time we got a regular room at a weekly rate of $350 plus tax. It was just as clean, one bed. table w/ chairs, frig, micro, wifi, HBO. The difference from the other cheap motels is only a few dollars but they treat you like a guest, not afraid to leave your clothes etc. in room, nothing is missing from rooms such as garbage cans, toilet paper holders, door or window knobs/locks, and the towels are thicker than rags. This is the place we'll come when working in Seattle from now on.

<Content>Great stopover value motel minutes from downtown Seattle Stayed there July 18th, a Friday night. The rooms were clean. The decor was spare, as you'd expect for a stopover motel. Had no problems with any noise from any neighbors. Traffic noise was muffled as soon as the doors and windows were closed. The resident hotel manager was particularly helpful. We really liked him. The parking is easy. The buses into downtown and the Space Needle run right by the motel. You have to walk over a bridge and down about 4 blocks, but they're every 15 minutes. The only thing we actually noticed not up to snuff was that the towels were a little threadbare. All and all, this is great stopover value for a motel that is so close to downtown. You can leave your car there all day and take the bus instead of paying 20/day parking downtown.

<Content>refund and left We stopped in, secured a room, went to the room then re-evaluated and decided to leave. It wasn't very impressive. Signs warning people against using drugs on property and no parties after 11pm. It just didn't seem safe or clean to us at all. The rooms were marred and worn out. They refunded the credit card easily so I appreciated that.

<Content>had to wear my flip flops in the shower I read the other reviews, cheap and clean, everyone said they were clean... Our room stank like a cheap hotel, the sheets looked clean but there were someone else's pubic hairs in the shower. I bought some incense to cover up the smell and never took my shoes off while in the room or shower. It was close to where we were going but I would never stay there again. They were friendly but our room also only had one towel in it, they did get us another when we asked. Not sure when the last time someone really cleaned the place, sure it had been a while. I'm not too picky when traveling on a budget just like to have a clean room.

<Content>Great Value Great Value for the Price! Staff was four star service and very accomodating. Cleans were simple, but clean and cheap.It is also very close to downtown, without having the pay the downtown premium. I would reocmmend this to anyone who is looking for a great deal.

<Content>old but clean and cheap It is an older property that shows wear but is clean.We got a room with 2 queen beds and mini-refrigerator for the price of a Motel 6. It is very convenient, about 10 minutes, to the center city - museum, monorail, space needle. It's just south of Green park which is a great place for outdoor activities and families. Further north on Aurora is the bad area, but this owner is very strict. It was as quiet as could be expected since it is on a main road. Would stay there again.

<Content>Good value It is not a five star hotel, but is a good choice for budget minded travelers. Staff were friendly and rooms were clean. Bathrooms were clean but their towels need replacing; they are fresh, clean, and white, but not very soft. Walking distance to Woodland Park Zoo and a 10 minute drive to downtown attractions.Again a good value for 50 - 60 dollars/night. Will stay there again.
