<Content>Best kept secret in Berlin This hotel is quiet, clean, friendly, reasonably priced, and in a great location. The staff are very friendly; I was really hungry in the middle of the afternoon, and the restaurant was closed, but they made me a small salad and some tea, which was great.Wireless internet access is free, but available only in the lobby.

<Content>Little Hotel Pleases Great experience at this economical little hotel with excellent location near major sites and stations. Clean, efficient, and unfailingly friendly. I needed some special help and the staff went out of its way to provide it. I would have felt like I was imposing at a bigger hotel, but at Dietrich-Bonhoeffer the staff shared my joy in resolving the problem (hint: passport). The bathrooms have soap but you need to bring shampoo. Comfy chairs in the lobby to sit while you cruise the free internet. Breakfast typically good, and they served me early so that I could eat before heading out for an early flight.

<Content>Best deal in Berlin Wedged between clasy Friedrichstrasse and bustling Orianenburgstrasse, right in the heart of East Berlin, this is probably your best deal in Berlin. Big, clean, confortable rooms, great breakfast and excellent location are the musts of this ideal hotel in Berlin. A close walk from 2 metro station, very close to the Friedrichstrasse Banhof, and to the river. I was not sure about this hotel when I first booked, but now there is no way I would come back to Berlin without staying there. This is not a luxurious hotel but it really is worth the price you pay.
