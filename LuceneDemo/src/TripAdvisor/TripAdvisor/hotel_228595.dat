<Content>comfie beds, bad location well i will start off saying that i was returning to barcelona on the tail end of a two week trip of spain. We had stayed at bed and breakfasts, 4 and 5 star hotels in our journey. St. Gervasi offered the most comfortable bed of our trip! I am not saying it is overly plush or anything, but we had been sleeping on what felt like boards so this was a welcome relief. the location is out of the way and the area does not have too much going on. it may seem like it is close on the metro line, but the line 7 is NOT a metro-it is a different style of train so you have to purchase an extra ticket.i say if you are visiting barcelona and you want to also stay in gracia, I recommend this hotel. if you want to stay in Barcelona, check out the bed and breakfast we loved-Casa de billy barcelona (i could not find it on trip advisor though).

<Content>Good cheap hotel Stayed in this hotel for a weekend break to watch fc barcelona. Ended up getting a taxi from the airport as didn't have a clue where i was going, cost 23euros so not too bad. Staff were welcoming and friendly. Room was of average size and very clean! Especially liked the little things they gave you i.e toothbrush, comb, tissues etc. Only downfall is no tea or coffee facilities in the room and for 2 coffees was 6euro. But there are a few little cafes close by.Only 2 min walk from the metro and 8 mins into the centre, very good location! Nice neighbourhood also.Booked through rooms.net and paid 拢150 for 3 nights.Would recommend.

<Content>Wonderful Stay This was a great hotel. I booked because of the great reviews on tripadvisor. There were barely any negative reviews and they were right. It was great. The front desk spoke perfect English. They overbooked for our class of room so we got bumped to a Junior Suite. It had a great view and a jacuzzi tub. The shower is tiny and so is the elevator. So if you are a large person or claustrophobic this may not be the hotel for you. But other than that, this was a great hotel. Also this hotel is far walking distance from a lot of tourist destinations. We rode the Metro and we liked staying in less tourousty part of town. There is a Silken on Las Rambla but I haven't stayed at that one.

<Content>Great Little Hotel We just returned from three days in Barcelona where we stayed at the St.Gervasi Hotel. The hotel is located on a small side street, more like an alley, but is just steps away from from some major shopping areas. The hotel exceeded our expectations in every way. The staff was especially helpful. The room was spotless as well as the public areas. The only problem was that it took us a little time to find good resturants outside of the hotel. We felt the hotel food service was a little overpriced. If we return to Barcelona we would stay here again.

<Content>Excellent value for the money! With this being my first trip to Spain I was filled with trepidation at the expectation of what the hotel was going to be like.I had heard that people had booked hotels online and didn't get what they paid for in Spain.However I was very pleased with this hotel.Firstly it is easily reachable from Ex Puxet Metro just two rights and you are there. Only a five minute walk literally. Ok so its on the north side of Barcelona, and up a quiet side street, but only a short walk to a fabulous quiet park with immense city views (highly recommended)The reception is open and inviting with staff that can speak French and English as well as their Mother tongue on call 24 hours a day!Fantastically polite, and very willing to please, I was made to feel right at home.The room was cosy with a clean bathroom, fresh towels and a fantasitic array of bath freebies.. a picasso box in an array of colours.. truly fab!The bed was comfortable, TV and a mini fridge containing an assortment of refreshments and snacks. I found these to be a bit on the expensive side, but across the road from the hotel is a local Spar grocer store that sells pretty much everything and very cheap. There is a cafe/bar for coffee and more along with a restaurant.Admittedly I did not eat here as I was too busy exploring the city to spend time at the hotel!Overall the hotel was comfortable and friendly. Not to mention helpful with advice when I needed it.There is internet access and to date was 鈧?.25 for a 45 minute card that you could reuse until your allotted time ran out. This was a god send for me as I don't own a laptop.I found the hotel to be excellent value for money, clean and comfortable. Thats what you want during your stay isn't it?

<Content>Lovely hotel, book with care Lovely hotel, however on arrival was informed our double room was unavailable that night, so we were offered a single that night and a suite the next 2 days- I booked pretty late before visiting so got the impression the hotel took our booking knowing there was no double room available but wanted as many rooms as possible full. Read a number of other reviews also saying this happened to other people.Nice hotel- but be wary if this would be inconvenient to you!

<Content>Better deal with easy access to city Just returned from 5 night stay. Booked at last minute based on reviews  price.Location  Directions:Although this is out of city centre, the advantage is it's quieter, better value  the train station is 2mins away. The maps on the site  Google aren't that accurate, so follow these directions:From airport get the blue aerobus to the terminus at Placa Catalunya (it only costs 7 Euros return  takes about half an hour). At Pl Catalunya, cross to the opposite side of the square (like a big roundabout)  on the corner of the next street look for the sign for FGC station. If you're here for a few days, select the T10 ticket option - this allows 10 journeys on any Metro/FCG Train/Bus in Zone 1 (otherwise just get a single for 1.30 Euros). Take the brown Line 7 to El Putxet Station (5 stops to Pl Catalunya) - takes less than 10mins.When leaving El Putxet, as you come up the steps, bear right  use the exit signposted 'C. Joaquim Folgeura'. At street level, turn right  look for 'Mercat de Sant Gervasi' (an indoor meat/fruit  veg market). Walk down the side of this  across a pedestrianised square to the road that runs parallel to the one you left. The road you are then on is Carrera de St Gervasi de Cassoles (which is the actual address for the hotel). Head left down this road  about 200 yards on the left is the hotel (opposite the SPAR supermarket). There's several cafe's, tapas bars  restaurants nearby (the hotel breakfast was ok for the money, but the evening meal we had was overpriced  they even charged us for the bread rolls!). As it's a residential area, take your phrasebook with you as, unlike in the city, the local restaurants don't have the menus in English. Alternatively, get the train back into the City for lots of choice.Staff on reception speak good English  were very helpful.Room: We had room 5 to the left of reception on the ground floor. Was a little concerned about noise, but it wasn't that bad, apart from the noisy guests above us who thankfully left after 2 nights. This room had the advantage of a small balcony, but only actually got sun for about half an hour. Room 6 next door was better positioned, but as the rooms face into an internal 'courtyard', the surrounding walls tend to block much of the sun. The room was a good size with a decent sized bed, wardrobes  safe deposit box . Decor is contemporary  functional, although TV picture quality was poor. There's a small mini bar with enough room to store some water/soft drinks from the SPAR across the road. No tea/coffee facilities in room (seems to be a common theme in Barcelona!). Bathroom was good size with shower/bath  hairdryer. Good range of complimentary toiletries i.e. tissues/toothbrush  paste/disposable razor  cream/small bottles of shampoo  bath gel/bath sponge/comb, but only a 2inch square piece of soap! Aircon works, but heating didn't (we had mixed weather, so had to turn off air con to keep room warmer).Out  about: To get back to city take FCG train to Placa Catalunya - you're then at the top end of Las Rambla  can use Metro to most places from there. Alternatively, if you want to visit Park Guell, just turn left out of hotel  when you reach main road, cross over to other side  walk up to the right about 200 yards to get the no: 74 bus - tell the driver where you want to go  they'll happily tell you when you're at the right stop (think it's near Larrard). At the drop off, cross over the dual carriage way  walk down to the left then take the 2nd right up the hill - it's signposted up to Park Guell. To get to the city from there look for the park exit nearest to Valcarca Metro station (near Glories?) - it's about 400 yards downhill to the station  turn right at the main road (again it's signposted all the way).

<Content>Disappointment Beautiful and clean hotel with friendly staff but for the price, we were quite disappointed. When we checked in, the TV didn't work. Who goes to Barcelona to watch TV, you'll say ? True, but for the price, we wanted to sample some Spanish shows. The staff was really nice and offered to change our room, but they put us in a smoking room that stunk (room 107) and it was situated right beside the cleaning ladies' closet so at 6 in the morning, we started hearing doors opening and closing and rampaging around. Plus, that particular room gave onto some kind of alley where for some reason, people (or maybe workers) threw rocks in some kind of metal bin. We didn't sleep for the whole 3 nights we were there. If our reservation hadn't been prepaid, we would have changed hotels. Furthermore, if this had happen right in downtown Barcelona, I could have understood it, but since that hotel is a bit out of the way, the inconveniences were not worth it at all. True, it is really simple to go to Plaza Cataluyana with the metro, but it doesn't change the fact that the hotel is located a bit far out. For us, it wasn't worth it. Gracia is a very nice neighborhood to visit though.

<Content>Above and Beyond My husband and I booked a package for Thanksgiving weekend through an airline vacation site for Barcelona ,Spain including 4 nights at the Silken St. Gervasi. We selected this hotel after reading positive comments on this site, especially regarding proximity of metro station. Upon arrival at 8 am, the hotel found no record of our reservation, nor could I produce our voucher. We enjoyed a lovely buffet breakfast at the hotel, while Marie and Laura at the front desk worked to resolve the problem. Laura kept saying, Don't worry, we'll take care of it. We'll make sure that you have a room.  They were finally able to contact the booking agency. Since the Silken was fully booked for one of the night, the booking agency sent us to a very nice hotel in a different location, where we could stay the full 4 nights.We could have been stranded with no hotel,no voucher, and no contact, but Marie and Laura spent a lot of time setting things right , even though the problem was not of their doing. They made our wait as pleasant and worry-free as possible, even calling a taxi for us and insisting we not pay for breakfast. We could not thank them enough and hope to return in the future to stay at this hotel, where we know we will be well taken care of.

<Content>Two thumbs up! Stayed only one night, booking it on the day itself (at Venere) after we decided to extend our stay in Barcelona. Overall, a fantastic experience!Though the map shows that this hotel is situated quite a distance from the main area (Ramblas, Placa Catalunya), a short 8-minute FGC train ride (no transfers required!) will take you to straight to Placa Catalunya metro station. Even better, the hotel is just round the corner (barely 200m) from the FGC Station (El Puxtet - Line 7).Although rated as a 3-star hotel, the rooms could easily pass off as one belonging to that of a 4-star equivalent. Lobby area is very new, while staff are polite and fluent in English. There's also a convenience store (SPAR Express) right across the road from the hotel entrance.Do note that it's in a quiet area (the hotel seems to cater more for businesss travellers), so don't expect a wealth of FB outlets (or entertainment for that matter) within the immediate vicinity after business hours.

<Content>Excellent I took my Boyfriend to Barcelona for his 21st for 3 days and we had a fantastic time!I was quite worried about booking the hotel online incase it didnt meet my expectations but I can honestly say that I have no complaints about the hotel/holiday!The hotel is exactly as you see it in the pictures...the rooms are spacious and clean with a lovely bathroom. We had a MASSIVE bed, safe (no extra cost), mini-bar, TV with satelitte, air conditioning...so there was everything you would possible need!The staff were very friendly, always willing to help and spoke very good english!The hotel is situated in north Barcelona but we didnt find this a problem at all because the metro station is literally a 2 minute walk and only 4 stops away from the centre (aprox 10mins). If you would rather take a taxi then it is aprox 12鈧?from the hotel to the centre!!There is so much to do in Barcelona and I would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone...me and my boyfriend are already trying to book up to go back again and if we do we would go back to the Silken St Gervasi with no hesitation!

<Content>Very comfortable and affordable This hotel was an excellent value for the price you pay. Great location, right next to the subway station. Very large and clean hotel room. You will not find a better value in Barcelona, if you are looking to stay on a budget. Will definitely stay here again!

<Content>Reasonable 3 star hotel Stayed here for 3 nights. A good safe location. Found the room rather small but clean. Room safe did not work. Walls very thin - could here other guests. Room/hotel info in the room was grubby and had been there a long time. Good bathroom with plenty of nicely presented toileteries.One the whole the staff were good but found the breakfast waiter couldn't be bothered to come and serve us and we were the only two people in the breakfast room! Decent breakfast though. Paid 拢66 per night per room - this included breakfast.

<Content>Not bad at all Stayed in this hotel in late Nov 2006, and we enjoyed it. The reception staff were friendly and smiley, and the hotel room clean and tidy. It was still warm by the time when we visited, but the air-con just did the job. I don't think there's a safety issue. As we observed, the area is very nice and we felt safe walking around. Location is all right, as it is very close to the metro station as well as some local cafes and restaurants. A market hall is just around the corner, perfect if you want to stock up some local produce. The down side is the thin wall. We could hear next door quite clearly on the last night we stayed, though we heard nothing on the previous nights. Tips: The hotel is not far from the Park Guell. If you don't want to take the metro and to tackle the uphill walk, just get a taxi from the hotel. It costs about 4 euros one way.

<Content>Brilliant hotel, lovely staff!!! My Husband and I stayed in this hotel last week, and we were so impressed we had to write a review as soon as we got back!!When we booked the hotel through Expedia we requested a quiet room as it was our wedding anniversary that day, and paid 拢52 for a standard room. When we arrived the staff upgraded us to a suite as it was our anniversary and they weren't fully booked. The suite was amazing, very modern with dark wood furnishings and neutral colours with a separate sitting area and a HUGE bed. It had the usual minibar, safe and TV with Satellite (only BBC World in English but never mind), but the best part was the Bathroom. It had marble walls and floors with a separate shower, bidet and a big corner bath with a jacuzzi!! That came in very handy!So the Hotel itself was fabulous, but if you decide to park your hire car in their car park like we did BE WARNED!! It is situated under the hotel and is the most horrendous space to manouvre a car around EVER. We had a Seat Leon, not the biggest car in the world, and because the car park is so steep and narrow my poor husband spent half an hour just trying to get down the ramp!!The hotel is quite easy to get to if you come by Taxi or Train (El Putxet metro is literally just around the corner). We had Sat Nav in the car, and still got lost in all the narrow little streets.However I have to say that i would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in this beautiful city. You simply cannot stay in a better hotel for this price.

<Content>The best Hoteldeal in barcelona One double or two twin beds. Contemporary gold-and-brown color scheme, dark-wood furnishings. Air-conditioned and soundproofed. In-room safe. Piped-in music channel; satellite TV. Minibar. Marble bathroom with shower/tub combination.The Hotel is situated in a quiet residential area of Barcelona, although itis only a few minutes away by Metro for Palza Catalunya.We were welcomed and expected when we arrived, by a very friendly englishspeaking staff. even the babycot we had ordered, were in place.When we first time opened the door to uour room, we were welcomed by a text on the TV screen.  The hotel wishes to welcome Mr. and Mrs......The beds were superb, the room was tasteful decorated, the airconditioning was great and quiet, and the bathroom was very, very nice. We have never seen so many armenties on a hotel room. there were practically everything.All in all , a very positive experience to stay on this hotel - especially when the price for a double room was as low as about $ 80. The hotel was classified as a 3 star but looked like 4 star. We will absolut come back to this hotel, next time we are in barcelona.

<Content>Very nice hotel We enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The hotel is pleasant and very clean. Room and bathroom are large enough. Staff is friendly and helpful. They provide us with map. The hotel is near El Putxet metro station. It takes about 20 minutes to get to the city center (metro Catalunya). Depending on time trains go every 5-10 minutes. Alternatively, you can get to the city center by bus. It takes about the same time and gives a fine view of the city.

<Content>Really good value I stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend in September 2004 and it proved to be ideal.The hotel is comparatively cheap and one of the reasons for this is the fact that it is quite a bit out of the main tourist areas of the city. Don't let this put you off however, as there is an underground stop literally one minute away from the hotel and you'll be at Placa de Catalunya within ten minutes. It is actually quite nice being in one of the quieter areas of the city and I would say it is one of the hotel's advantages.The room is quite small but comfortable with a clean bathroom, a huge bed and cable TV. We didn't have a chance to try the restaurant downstairs but it looked quite nice although rather pricey.The staff were helpful but to be honest we only encountered them while checking in and checking out because we had no problems at all.The only disadvantage is that if you want to stay out late in the main areas of the city then you will almost certainly have to get a taxi back and doing this every night adds up and can end up being quite expensive.But other than that, it's the ideal hotel for people who are looking to explore the city and just need a cheap but very comfortable base.

<Content>Extremely good hotel! I stayed at Silken St Gervasi in late February 2005 with my boyfriend. We stayed for 3 nights for 拢75 each on a good deal booked with Expedia. I was very impressed with the service. The staff were very welcoming and could be relied on for recommendations to local bars and restaurants. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable, they change your towels every day (without fail) and sheets if need be - which you don't always get in some hotels. The hotel is situated near the red tourist bus route (Barcelona has 4 tourist bus routes blue, green, yellow and red). There are cash machines nearby and 2 small bars which are less than 3 mins walk from the hotel. You are 2 mins from the El Padua metro station which is 10 mins from Placa de Catalunya, which makes you very central to Barcelona. While staying there we went to see Barcelona FC play Marbella at Nou Camp we paid 22 euros each on the night - which was a bargain. Although we did visit Port Vell (seafood is fantastic), the Gothic Quarter and Las Ramblas...the best place to eat was the area near Picasso's museum it is known in Barcelona as the cheapest place to eat (for those of you on budgets). We did not have a bad bottle of wine during our stay! For breakfast there is a cafe/bakery on the near the Metro station...they do very good pastries.

<Content>Excellent we arrived late on a Saturday night to be told that the hotel was over-booked and they had booked a room for us in a nearby hotel. We were quite happy to go along with this, the room they had booked was more than adequate and only a couple of hundred yards away from the first hotel. For the second and third nights of our stay we returned to the Silken St Gervasi hotel and were upgraded to a suite (with jacuzzi, king-size bed etc) at no extra cost, to make up for the inconvenience. The staff were very helpful and the room was just perfect. The hotel is near a metro stop (El Putxet), and very easy to find, it is also a nice distance away from the city centre to allow an escape from the madness. Overall a very happy stay, will return again if we are in Barcelona

<Content>A Great 3-starts Hotel We stayed at this lovely 3 starts hotel in July 2004. Although it's far from the center, we were happy with our choice since the hotel was new (European hotels tend to be in rather old buildings, and have old, too soft beds etc.), very clean, and served a fresh breakfast with great coffee.The staff was nice and efficient, and helped us immediately with every question or problem.So the pleasant atmosphere in the hotel totally made up for the relatively large distance from the center.

<Content>Pleasant hotel We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in the beginning of August 2004, because we got a good internet rate.I would describe the room as being a standard hotel room - it was nice, had all the facilities/inclusions that you would expect at a 4 star hotel, was of a good size, and was very clean and comfortable - but it was nothing special.The metro stop is just around the corner and only a few stops away from attractions and action. It's very easy to get around.There was a complete lack of places to eat around the hotel, or anything open, for that matter - so be prepared to go further afield for your meals.

<Content>Competent hotel We stayed at the Sant Gervasi in the spring '01. It's located in the northern part of Barcelona, not really within walking distance of any lively, must-see areas. But there are all sorts of stores and restaurants in the area. There's a great bakery called Pastisserie Serra around the corner of the hotel (they're a chain with a few locations throughout the city). The fruit tart creations were heavenly and I long for the day when I can eat them again. The hotel itself is modern and pleasant -- the standard twin room had comfortable twin beds and fairly spacious bathroom. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful in arranging our departing taxi.
