<Content>Great hotel, great location. back again We have stayed at this great hotel before, and if in berlin we will always come here. It has a great location, just a 5 min walk to check point charlie, 5 min walk to underground, a good base for exploring Berlin. The hotel itself is quite small but that suits us, rooms clean and fair size. Nice breakfast room, serving usual continental breakfasts, all very tasty. our breakfast was included in the price of the room, I think it is better to deal direct with the hotel. Joined to the hotel is a lowenbrau beerkeller, they have a good menu at reasonable prices, please note however there is more choice on the german menu, than the english this is due to menu changes, the staff are friendly and very helpful. And are happy to go through the menu with you. Would I come back to this hotel again - you bet. I recomend a visti to the Ka Da We department store, especially the 6th floor a must for foodies, plenty of food options. If in Alexanderplatz have a drink by the river on the outside terrace of the radison, go inside and see the giant fish tank in reception, look up it is not at eye level. Take a boat trip from here at only 7 euros it was very good value, please note the guide may only speak german, this didn't bother us, had a nice relaxing boat ride. weather was fantastic, take sun cream.

<Content>Room was fine but probably won't stay again I booked this hotel through Venere based on location and price (and the reviews there  on Tripadvisor sounding OK, of course !). The price was 鈧?8 pn for a standard double 鈥?not quite such a bargain when I discovered it didn't include breakfast (which was 鈧?0 pppd extra), but still reasonable value I think. It bills itself as 4* but I'd say it is 3* and resembles a mid-priced chain hotel. The room  bathroom were both quite adequate and clean. The location was very good 鈥?walking distance to most of the Mitte sights, restaurants, etc; but also very close to the Stadtmitte underground station which has 2 lines serving lots of other places. We probably wouldn't stay there again, though, due to the unhelpfulness of the staff we encountered. The one time we tried the breakfast the woman on duty seemed positively hostile, and propped open the door on to the street 15 minutes before the official end-time for breakfast (in March !!) to try to get rid of us. And when I came to pay the bill the receptionist said there was a problem with my debit card (which I'd been using elsewhere throughout our stay), I phoned my bank and found an authorisation request hadn't even been received, the receptionist continued to insist it was my problem until I gave in  went out to get cash from an ATM to pay the bill (as we had a flight to catch). I had suggested paying by international transfer when I got home (which I've done once before when a hotel's POS equipment wasn't working), but got the impression that she wasn't going to let us leave the hotel without paying.

<Content>Basic but modern! My husband and I spent a week here on our first visit to Berlin. We chose this hotel because it is located right in the middle of the city (East) and within easy walking distance of attractions, U-Bahn and posh shops! There is no sprawling reception area, just a desk as soon as you enter and the lift is right there. The outside of the hotel looks like an office block and it faces a very busy main highway - we got a room facing a side street which was fairly quiet. The airconditioning was just a vent blowing air and made little difference to the room temperature. It was hot so we slept with open windows and threw the wonderful fluffy winter duvets on the floor!The room was very spacious, welcoming and furnishings were brand new, understated, tasteful and comfortable. The double bed was huge and as is common in Germany, with two mattresses - lovely if your partner bounces around a lot like mine does! The bathroom was of adequate size, all new and sparkling with chrome fittings, black and white everything ... all very colour coordinated. There was ample hallway space for luggage and a good size wardrobe with large dressing mirror. There was a TV (no English channels at that time), desk and a nice seating area.The breakfast was served in a small room which did not have quite the feel of a restaurant and the food was reasonable. We ate dinner a couple of times in the Bavarian restaurant downstairs and a little Italian restaurant up the road ... both very good.This hotel has no extra frills but value for money it is and ideal for business people. Not much emphasis is placed on service but it is not that kind of hotel. You are left much to your own devices but we were quite happy to just get on with it.Hotel site is (---)
