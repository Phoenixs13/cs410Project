<Content>Avoid to stay in this chain We are a family and we arrive very late expecting our room us we had confirmed twice. At 2 in the morning they send us to a hotel miles away. We were told this place was close but it was all not true. Next day we spoke to a woman, who claimed to be the director, never seen in my life such an inpolite person After comming back in my country and sharing this with same people, they have the same experience with an other Catalonia hotel.

<Content>good and worth I stay in the hotel for 4 nights and found it very comfortable and charmy.I am limited in movement and it was close to public transportation. The breakfast meal was beyond expectations. The crew were helpful. The room has been arranged twice a day.The bathroom was very modern with a bide, hot water all the time. The hotel was quite in this season in spite it is on the main road. I recommend on it in worm heart.

<Content>We do not recomend the Roma We loved Barcelona but can't think of any positive things to say about this hotel. It is not close to any of the city's tourist attractions, certainly not La Rambla. It's rated 3 stars, but is worthy of 2 at best. It has no charm or curb appeal -- if you aren't paying attention you will walk/drive right past it since it is no wider than 10 meters across the front and wedged between two other nondescript gray buildings. If you are driving a car beware, the garage is in a separate building, getting in and out is difficult due to tight corners and ramps, and all the hotel information (website, brochures, etc.) conveniently leave out the fact that parking will cost you 15 euro / day. Rooms face either a depressing concrete shaft in the middle of the building or a very noisy street on the front side. Even after long days of walking this beautiful city the unbearable street noise made it difficult to sleep. When it comes to hotel choices in Barcelona, you can do much better for the same cost. Even if proximity to the Estacio Sants station is a priority, there are better options in the area.

<Content>A great hotel I stayed at the roma for four nights this year in august. Our room was lovely, tastefully decorated and clean. The staff were all very attentive and helpful makin us feel welcome although at 18 we were probably the youngest people there. The hotel is very well situated, around 5mins from metro, tourist bus and taxi points all of which are very easy to find, but it still remains peaceful at night. All in all it made my first time in barcelona very enjoyable and I'd recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Really Nice Hotel, Very Helpful Staff..! Stayed here 10th-14th June 2004 and can highly recommend it. Ideally place for the the metro  station  a short walk from some very nice restaurants, a lovely bakery, nice bar next door - very nice sangria..! We had a tastefully furnished room on the 6th floor (lovely  quiet), bathroom was fine, clean etc - everything you'd expect. Your every whim catered for - well stocked mini-bar, fresh towels everyday, the usual toiletries - even a comb  a shoe-polisher! There's a mini-safe too (small charge, 3 euros per day), on the whole a great place to stay. We were there for the Catalunya Moto GP, we'll be there next year too..!

<Content>Nice Hotel We were impressed with this hotel. It is near the train station and the metro is nearby. Montjuic is only a 10 minute walk away. The room was clean and tastefully decorated. The breakfast was excellent, with plenty of choice and great apple cake! I would use this hotel again.

<Content>Excelent Customer Service I did not stay at the Roma. I was due to stay at the Roma but on arriving was informed that their was a fault with the Hotel (I understand something to do with heating) - accomadation had been aranged, with an upgrade in another of the chains Hotels in the City and the taxi (at their cost) would be at the door to pick us up in two minutes.The customer service and way they handled a problem was first rate and I was extreamly pleased with my treatment. The Hotel we went to was good, clean and plesent and on this basis I would recomend this Hotel Chain.

<Content>Avoid it like the plague This hotel takes the biscuit. Although it's a fair old distance to La Rambla, the public transport is excellent and will have you there in under 10 minutes. The hotel is a different matter. Read on if you dare...Our check in time was supposed to be 11.50am but our room was not available until almost 1.00pm. As you can appreciate, having been up since 4.30am, we were eager to rest. Not the worst start you say, well here goes. Our room, 1006, was located on floor E (between the lobby and the first floor if you can picture it) with a single-glazed window overlooking the entrance lobby doors. Essentially, this meant that we had virtually no natural light and no privacy, as the window was not suited to sound deadening purposes. We had to keep the drapes and blackout curtain closed for the entire weekend. Combine that with the paper-thin walls (where I could hear the Italian woman next door, pronto, pronto, pronto) and the picture is starting to fill out!There were cracks and water stains on the ceiling of the room. Mould was beginning to bubble and grow behind the main entrance door to the room. The air conditioning unit expelled hot air (regardless of whether the hot or cold setting was selected), thus making the room extremely uncomfortable to sleep and rest in. Hot water for showers etc. was scarce after 9.30am (evidently, it was syphoned off to the heating system). The most interesting point about the room was having what sounded like the main sewage pipe for the entire building running down the side of our bed. Every time somebody flushed a toilet it sounded as if the biblical flood of Moses was about to inundate us! So disconcerting was the noise that we had two very restless nights. That was not the extent of our suffering in Hotel Roma.On our very first night, at 1.15am, we had two intruders in the room. I heard the door to our room unlocking and I sprang from the bed just as two men entered the room. Fortunately, a loud roar persuaded them to leave rather quickly. When we tried to report this to the front desk the next morning, I had barely gotten the words 'bon dia' out of my mouth when the receptionist was apologising for the incident, which a 'guest' had already reported. Apparently the guest was drunk, had mistaken his first floor with our 'E' floor and stumbled into our room. The 'guest' maintained that the door to the room was open and he simply pushed it open and walked in. The receptionist told us that the two floors were the same in layout and that we must have forgotten to lock our door. This is not the case with any of the above.Unfortunately, I have a terrible habit with locks; I can't even drive to the shops without making sure that every door in the car is locked. This is how I know that I locked the door. I know that my partner checked it after me, as she has the same inclination. Consequently, I know that the door could not have simply been pushed open. Secondly, the two men were not drunk. They didn't stare at me when I shouted at them, as drunkards would do. Both were fully cognisant of their surrounding and left without even tripping over one another. What was most disturbing was that the second man had a key in the door and it was not the card that guests use to enter their rooms. It is this which makes me believe that it was a staff member trying to do God only knows what. Finally, I went up to the first floor to see the layout for myself after leaving the receptionist. Although the general L-shape of the building was the same on that floor, the arrangement of the doors was completely different. In my opinion, there is no way that there could be any confusion between the floors, and hence the rooms.Immediately after the 1.15am incident, somebody in the lobby started moving the furniture around the marble floor, creating a horrible screeching sound. Who, other than staff members, would be able to do this at this hour? I felt like calling ghostbusters! This cacophony continued for about two hours; I know this because it kept me awake, watching satellite TV, which consisted of French, Spanish, Italian and one BBC news station. In total, there were 8 wonderfully entertaining foreign stations. I ended up having a makeshift barrier behind our locked door, MacGyvered from two suitcases and a chair. All I was short of was the double barrell and the rocking chair. The rest of the weekend in that hotel was (thankfully) relatively uneventful.Hotel Catalonia Roma was not my idea of a nice hotel by any means. I have nothing but compassion for the poor misfortunates who stay in this hotel.I have stayed at many hotels throughout Ireland and Europe, mainly budget, and this is the first time I have experienced anything like this. Needless to say, I cannot recommend the Hotel Catalonia Roma on any level. Upon investigation throughout the city itself, we found that we would have had far superior accommodation in a better location.Stay clear of this particular hotel. If there's anybody familiar with Fawlty Towers and Basil Fawlty out there, then you'll appreciate that you should avoid this place as if it were like the in-laws house.Truely dreadful.
