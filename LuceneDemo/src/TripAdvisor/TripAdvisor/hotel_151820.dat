<Content>Terrible experience The place is very run down and is in serious need of a major renovation. DO NOT eat at their restaurant. The food is awful. We were the only ones there, and we were there for a good 1 1/2 hours. No wonder. You can get better mufongo at a takeout restaurant, and for considerably less money. As the other dishes came out, it was one disappointment after another. Even the bread was bad. Wow.On several occasions, when we needed something, no one was at the front desk. If you want an enjoyable experience in PR, go elsewhere.

<Content>Trouble getting back overcharge They charged an extra $ ( a couple of hundred dollars). It took 9 weeks to get money returned. Something is wrong with management. When I first asked for it, they told me they do refund processing only at end of month. Why??? If they know they overcharged, why cannot they make an correction right way. Anyway, they did not make correction at the end of the month. I needed to call them again at the middle of the month. Now, they said they will do it right way. ???? I would like to advise everyone that the restaurant's food is not good. They are a lot of places better and cheaper than that. I will never never advise anyone to go there.

<Content>Great Location , but highly needed quality service Were do I start ....1st they are lacking of employees ,they have the same guy to check you in, attend the bar ,serve an cook breakfast , room service ( Joel your the man ).With 1 employee doing all this how can you expect any type of good service. 2nd the pool needs to be cleaned and painted ,because there was scum all over the place. I love my island of Puerto Rico ,but Porlamar is in need of more employees and people that really care. The girl from front desk did not know anything ,she was just their. Really the best thing that I liked was the location and air conditioner ,beside this what else can I say .I usually say positive comments ,but you are lacking of service. Sorry Porlamar I will never return to your facilities.

<Content>Parador Posada Porlamar I have stayed at the Parador Posada Porlamar three times as part of a dive package in conjunction with Parguera Divers, the dive shop on the grounds of the inn. The rooms come with TV, a private bath (shower only, no tub) and are air conditioned. The rooms are simple. You won't find fluffy towels or chocolates on the pillow, just a simple, clean, room and bath. I have only stayed in the top two floors. There are two lower floors as well. After I made my reservation with the dive shop for this third trip, I received a call notifying me that there would be live music on the weekends and was given the opportunity to cancel. I decided to keep my room and am glad I did since the music was not loud. The inn is near several restaurants and bars and two small markets as well . A pharmacy is nearby for your convenience. I only ate in the hotel restaurant once because I received a meal voucher for $25. The food was quite good, but I felt it was a little pricey. This is a great bang for the buck as long as you are not looking for luxury. The dive shop itself is outstanding. Angel Rovira runs a first class operation. My experience each time has been very positive because I had a certain set of expectations and am pleased with how things turned out.

<Content>Great dives, great food When I arrived in San Juan and rented a car to make the long trip to La Parguera the rental agent's eyes lit up. He explained that Americans don't normally go there, it is more of a local vacation spot. I hoped that the diving would be all that I imagined. It was.The owner of the dive shop on the premise of Posada Polamar, Angel, is extremely knowledgeable and very safety minded. I dove six days with him and his crew (Victor is also an awesome dive master) I was constantly amazed at Angel's knowledge and ability to draw a good laugh. While diving I saw two barracuda's and one shark as well as the assortment of eels, tropical fish and one of the most beautiful walls.One mistake I made is booking the cheapest room (this was quickly upgraded by the hotel after I complained). The first floor rooms really are not good rooms. Do yourself a favor and make sure your room is not on the first floor (1XX).The food in the hotel was the best I could find in La Parguera. Make sure you give the Paella a try!! (hint: don't eat at the Steak restaurant across the street from the hotel...trust me on this one)Great dives, great food. What more could you ask for?

<Content>Did the Diving package at the hotel I booked the hotel through pagueras divers which has a shop and its dive boat at the hotel. For anyone who scuba dives this is excellent diving and a great set up. The hotel is clean and nice. If the lowest class hotel you are willing to stay at is a Hilton then don't bother. The rooms are not fancy but the A/C works and we stayed on the top floor which had great views. It is nice to roll out of bed and walk down to the dive boat to do your diving. The hotel serves breakfast which is included and give one dinner which was included. breakfast wasn't fancy (either fresh eggs, frozen eggo waffles, or frozen eggo pancakes) but the dinner is very fancy and expensive. Actually they gave a $50 voucher for the dinner and you'll spend over that. If you are diving, definitely stay there. If you are just visting the area, it is clearly one of the nicer hotels in that area (closest hilton is Ponce)

<Content>Avoid Porlamar Por Favor!!!! The only positive thing I have to say about this parador is that at least we could find a place to sleep a few hours after being in Boqueron and Mayaguez all day. The problem was that the room was incredibly dirty. Examples of the lack of cleanliness include body hairs in the bedroom sheets, bathtub, and a nice spider that came down on top of us while we were somehow trying to fall asleep. Next time, I will keep driving even if I fall asleep on the road rather than stay here. As a Puerto Rican that was trying to show his wife how beautiful his home country is, I was totally embarrased by the condition of the hotel. Too bad, because the location is great, right in front of La Parguera.

<Content>Porlamar Problem Our room was a windowless white box with a single circular flourescent light. The upstairs rooms are probably better. The hotel restaurant, La Pared, is unbelievably expensive. Our $25 each dinner voucher didn't cover half the bill and we are not extravagent. The food is mediocre. A big plus is that the scuba operation on site, Parguera Divers, is excellent.
