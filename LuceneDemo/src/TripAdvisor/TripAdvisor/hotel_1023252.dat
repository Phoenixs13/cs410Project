<Content>What a fantastic experience We chose to stay at the Mara River Safari Lodge for one night for the experience. We are so glad we did. Out on our balcony we viewed the zebra's playing, wilderbeast eating and the rhino just doing his thing. The elephants came through the river below us for their bath after a hard days work and even that was a sight to see. This place is definitely worth a visit for a night (or two if you so wish). The Safari itself is worth seeing. They have so many different animals from all over the world. Do yourself a favour and go on the Safari tour when you are next in Bali. You wont regret it. The accommodation itself was more than sufficient. We stayed in the top level of a townhouse. The room is circular and the bed is smack bang in the middle of the room. All features in the room and bathroom are themed towards the safari. It really is well set up.
