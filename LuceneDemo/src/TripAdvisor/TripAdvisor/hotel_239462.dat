<Content>cheap cheerful clean We booked this hotel because it was cheap and near the Leidesplein. It was exactly what I expected i.e no frills at all but the room was very clean and tidy. The weather was snowy and very cold but our room was lovely and warm to come back to. I also liked the shower.

<Content>Our stay in the King Hotel. On the weekend of 5th to 9th September 2008 I stayed at the King Hotel in Leidesplein Amsterdam along with my partner, my son and his young (17) girlfriend.We were pleasantly surprised by the location, comfort, value and cleanliness of the hotel. Located on a canal and very near nightlife, tram routes, boat excursion stops, good eateries and bars, it was an ideal base for our long weekend.However, the reason I felt the need to review this hotel is the way the hotel staff, owners and local police officers reacted when our weekend turned bad. For still unexplained reasons the young girl with us suffered a serious reaction to either alcohol or accidentally inhaled substances. No-one in our party knowingly took anything other than lager the whole weekend. Despite this, she became extremely violent and vocal in the early hours of Sunday morning. When my son and I could no longer contain the situation the hotel staff came to my aid and called the emergency services. A team consisting of police officers and paramedics arrived astonishingly quickly and (at my request) took her to a nearby police station for a physical examination and to try and calm her down. At this point I would have quite understood the hotel asking us to leave bearing in mind the huge disruption the episode caused to the other hotel guests. I would also have understood the police presenting us with a bill for the doctors and officers who attended to her overnight.Suffice it to say I am very impressed with the care and attention we received from everyone involved during a very difficult night many miles from home.If you are in Amsterdam - you should stay at the King Hotel.It's that simple.

<Content>It all added to the experience.. I went in april with my friend for our 18th. It was booked on the cheap really, so I wasnt expecting luxury.The only thing to point out was the absolutely awful smell which took your breath as soon as you walked in. It smelt like rotten eggs, but the lucky thing was the stink didnt reach our room. However, it did make us not trust the food, so even though we paid for breakfast, we never went for it. Also.. those stairs are a deathtrap.. and the lift seemed unsafe to take at the same time.Despite all this, the staff were friendly and kindly let us keep our luggage behind the reception as we were too early to go to our room. The room were clean, and cleaned daily. And, we hardly stayed in anyway, only too sleep.. so the fact the hotel wasn't luxurious, it wasnt a big deal.I wouldnt change going there, as it was a funny experience.

<Content>"King" Hotel. Awh King Hotel! we could not find the place when we arrived but we got pointed in the right direction and we walked along and saw a nice hotel BUT THEN were confronted by the green and yellow sign saying King Hotel. We nervously laughed. You had to ring a bell to get in through a horrible brown door. THEN we were consumed by thee weirdest smell ever! no idea how to decribe it, but it was so weird! we didnt realise there was a lift and carried our suitcases up the narrowest stairs ever! the pink carpet was stained! but when we reached our room (Room 20) we were pleasently surprised. very veryyyy small!! but clean. the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread and one singular egg! between everyone who stayed there! we loved the king hotel. it made our holiday... although if you are looking for somewhere nice... don't go.

<Content>Stay away We love Amsterdam and tried a new hotel, the King Hotel. We booked it through hotels.nl. When we wanted to chek in, the manager told us that they charged a surcharge of 30鈧?if we paid with a credit card. We didn't have the amount in cash so we told them that according to our written contract (print out from the webpage) there was no surcharge. The manger and the owner (via the phone) were extremly unfriendly. In the end they told us that they would reimburse us the money (145鈧? whcih was the downpayment). We are still waiting for this reimbursement. We didn't stay at this hotel and found another one nearby.We do not recommend this hotel at all

<Content>April 2008 The first thing to greet you as you walk through the front door is the stench. I lift wasn't always working and the stairs are VERY steep.Our room was almost too small for the two beds, the bathroom is tiny - handbasin too small and tap too big so the best way to have a wash was in the shower. Brilliant shower by the way.Breakfast room didn't appear to have enough seating if all the rooms were occupied, and every time anyone came through the door the stench came too. Also the staff didn't seem in too much of a hurry to replenish the breakfast items.All in all NOT one I'd recommend - unless your a backpacker on a limited budget.

<Content>Oh my god the smell! Impossible to find unless you knew where it was. Asked for tea and coffee in the rooms which they kept forgetting and then sending up kettles which sparked every time you plugged them in! Bedside light fell off every time you tried to to switch it on and the window was jammed, so thanks for the free sex show next door (NOT) and it was freezing! Receptionist couldn't even tell us how to get the zoo and the smell was just disgusting. We did tell them but they didn't seem to notice it but on our last day they put Joss sticks up in reception. Nice try but no way! Lovely location tho, just try another hotel! Americain looks fab!

<Content>couldn't swing a cat arrived at the hotel on 29 december and stayed til the 3rd of january 08. Definately not a place to stay if you like comfort it was extremely small and poky and for the price we paid really expected a bit more. There was a terrible smell in the hotel like they had a problem with the drains or something. Breakfast was only served between 8 and 9.30 and was really not worth getting up for. Stairs were very steep and narrow thank god they had an elevator! Bathroom also was very small but clean and had a nice power shower. Really the best thing about this hotel is its location everything else leaves a lot to be desired. However even the poor hotel could not take away from the experience that is Amsterdam..

<Content>My Stay At The King Hotel  I booked this Hotel in March for a week I went from Scotland and found this Hotel ok. One thing that spoiled it was the Guy i went with snored all night.( Noisy begger) The one thing that springs to mind is the stairs in the hotel are very steep so beware anyone that has any difficulty with stairs, so you would be better to ask for bottom floor when you are booking, apart from the stair's all was ok. The room was basic but ok with t v in room, but no remote, Heaters were in the room ,which is handy as Holland in March can be cold ( take note ) shower rm was alright and spacious which was just outside the main room door, also toilet was not far at end of the hall. Breakfast was basic, Id much rather a British style cooked breakfast but i knew in advance. After a look around the city i found a restaurant called the Londoner it was ok with good old fashioned Fish n' chips and a pint Hieneken which was free with meal ( jist cannae beat that like's ) Oh and last but not least if you have bags/ belongings then look after them as Holland is rife with sticky fingers, if u leave behind you wont get them back.

<Content>Not spectacular but pleasant I stayed there for 2 nights, 28 and 29 Sept. The single room was tiny! And the walls were so thin I kept getting woken up by neighbours opening their doors.Breakfast spread was limited.Location was OK but I wouldn't have been able to find it if I hadn't called the hotel. Take tram 1, 2 or 5 from Centraal Station ($1.60euros) and stop at Leidseplein (about a 10 minute ride). There is an opera house of sorts. Walk past it and you'll see Cafe Americain. That's the American Hotel. King Hotel is about 2 minutes away on the same block.There is a very good row of restaurants nearby, just opposite where the pub area is. I had fantastic Greek and Italian dinners. Good prices.

<Content>Same hotel? It must have improved We found our way to the King Hotel by way of the hotel call board in the airport. Reading the reviews after the fact it doesn't sound like the same place. In Leidesplein, on the canal, right? It was absolutely fine for 100 euro a night. The room was small but clean, comfortable double bed with nice duvet, nice flat screen TV with remote, a/c, hair dryer, and an excellent shower. The sink is amusingly tiny and you have to make sure you don't bang your head on the faucet or the shelf but they did a lot in a tiny space. Our bathroom was all IN the room, not down a hallway. If it helps, we were in room 27, on the top floor, which always made going up and down the steep stairs a fun challenge too.Breakfast provided coffee, tea, juice, various cereals, breads, coldcuts, soft boiled eggs, and fruit cocktail. Adequate for included. It appeared to have in-room internet hook-up too but I never bring a laptop when I'm concentrating on having fun! The location was excellent. Quietly tucked around the corner from a great happening area.We got the last room available so maybe there were lesser rooms we weren't even aware of. We asked to see it before signing on the dotted line, which is always a good idea. The hotel full sign went up after we checked in so we were doubly pleased we didn't have to go door knocking to find another room.

<Content>Not a good experience After eventually finding my booking reservation (and i wish they hadn't) I spent 3 days in this place. I had a 'luxery' room which contained a sink- unfortunately i couldn't wash or dare drink the water due to the oil smell and consistency of the water. One to avoid.

<Content>Clean, Cheap Good location...perfect hotel for the easy going!!! We stayed in the King Hotel this year. At first i was apprehensive about booking it as it has received mixed reviews on trip advisor. But it was reasonable priced and well located. Honestly it was fine? Its very well located within walking distance to the rijksmuseum, heinekin museum, van gough musuem and the market! (about 10/15 mins). the walk might seem long but you theres plenty of beaultiful scenery on the way!! I cant fault the location for that. your not completey in the hustle and bustle of the city but leidensplien square provides great entertainment and is only around the corner. Trams bring you to Damrak square every few minutes. The hotel itself i thought was fine. Yes its very small (tiny), ok our room view consisted of another guests room, but it was clean, friendly and provided a large choice of breakfast.although our room was not like the pictures that were shown on their website to advertise it. My only fault with this hotel? The stairs!! its easier to walk up it than down! Ladies.. DONT wear the high shoes when coming down..unfortunately i know this the hard way!!Also when we arrived we had to pay an extra 10 euro each, i think it was some type of tax? city perhaps. it just would have been nice to know that before arriving! i cant really fault this hotel? if your fussy and like your luxury and comfort its not for you. if your like myself and not going to spend much time there but want something clean cheap and a good location, then its good value for money! if i was going back there on a budget it wouldnt bother me to stay there again.

<Content>Not great Rooms here a pretty small, clean but a bit grubby, and overpriced. Forget getting a room that remotely resembles the ones they show on the website. Toilets and showers are in the corridors and are absolutely tiny. We paid 鈧?5 a night here for a double (well actually a twin, and one of the beds had a broken leg which I had to try to screw back on to stop the bed falling over) and it wasn't good value - you even have to pay to leave your luggage after checkout, when every hotel I have ever been to has allowed that for free. It's a good location and seems pretty secure, but I'm sure there must be better deals out there.

<Content>Don't be fooled First things first, this is not a hotel, it is a youth hostel. As youth hostels go, it was clean, secure, relatively quiet (except for the slamming doors) nicely located, and expensive.By hotel standards, the room was small, the beds uncomfortable, bathrooms were accessible but down the hall, the remoteless TV didn't work well, no air-conditioning, no non-smoking rooms, and the breakfast was mediocre at best.In short, it's a hotel for single travelers, not families of any variety.Don't be fooled.

<Content>Walk in closet I have just returned from a 3 night stay in single 'room' number 21 at the cost of 165 euros plus tax. I have stayed in a variety of hotels ranging from 5* to shared hostel accomodation. I understand the difference between hostel, budget, luxury etc. This was, in complete honesty, the worst, least value for money place I have ever experienced. I think 'room' 21 has been created by erecting a very thin partion in room 20 (most likely was previously the the walk -in wardrobe of this room) The photos of rooms on the website are completely alien to me. You will find, on arrival, that there is no left luggage facility, unless you want to pay 1 euro per hour, no tea or coffee making facility, unless you want to pay 15/16 euros for your 'entire' stay, no tv remote, unless you want to pay a 5 euro deposit, no key, unless you want to pay a 20 euro deposit..... shall I continue? I couldn't wait to get out of this most depressing place, unfortunately it has clouded my view of Amsterdam, I won't return.

<Content>convenient and cheap I was apprehensive about booking a budget hotel but need not have worried.The hotel was in a great position within walking distance of the main museums and our room though tiny overlooked the canal. Our room was on the third floor and as the stairs were very steep it might be a problem for some. The staff were really helpful at all times, at breakfast if some foods weren't left they brought more as soon as it was noticed or mentioned. This is a budget hotel so don't expect five star accomodation or service but for the price it's a good deal.

<Content>very basic... Just got home from a 2 night stay at the king hotel in amsterdam. It certainly was very basic. Our room was a double and basically consisted of the bed, a small wardrobe, wash basin and 2 chains. The room was extremely small and the walls were all scuffed and dirty. To be honest we didn't spend a great deal of time in the room, its not somewhere you could come back to relax in for a couple of hours, especially if you're phobic of small spaces! The shared toilet/shower facilities were not too bad, just dont expect to be able to shower first thing in the morning as the facilities are shared with 20 other rooms on your floor.Overall it wasn't a bad experience, hotel staff were pleasant but we were shocked to find you have to pay a 20 euro deposit for the keys, of which you get back when you check out. There is also no where to leave your luggage if you get there early or if you have late flights on the way home. We stored ours in the lockers in the central station.The buffet breakfast was not bad, some nice choices were available and are served between 8 and 9:30 am.I suppose you get what you pay for however the rooms did not resemble the photographs on the website or in the brochure we got sent.I would definately not go back to this hotel.

<Content>Better than expected! We stayed in King Hotel as a young couple just a week ago. As we arrived in Amsterdam without having booked a hotel, we were quite concerned if it would be posible to find a cheap and still nice hotel. we were lucky enough to find King Hotel by chance.As we entered the hotel, we were greeted by a friendly staff, and offered to take a look at the room before renting it as we weren't quite sure about the sharing toilet/bathroom thing. But when we saw the room (#4) we were really sure that it really is the place!! The room was nice and clean, it had a double bed and a single bed, a sink and towels in the room, plenty of space and a beautiful view of the canal. Besides, it is so close to the center, and Leidseplein is just behind the corner. Ask any Dutch person to confirm, that it is the place for nightlife!!The receptionist gave us all the info we wanted about the places to dine and go out and was in general very helpful. The steps are steep, thats true, but we didn't here any noises from inside or outside the hotel. Probably we were just lucky. I believe it is a great value for money, but if you expect a uniformed staff, bathtub and someone to take care of your luggage - don't go there!!

<Content>King of Kings Have to admit I was wary when my friend told me she'd booked our accomodation at a 1* budget hotel, being a fairly well-travelled, luxury-loving holiday snob. That said, I had no reason to worry. We were met by friendly staff, pleasant and clean surroundings, a cosy room and a great breakfast spread each morning. The shared bathroom facilities were maintained well and, in general, this was great value for money!My only problem with the King Hotel were the staircases - very very steep!! If you can face those, though, this is place is a must.

<Content>Not the best :-( Very friendly welcome but you definitely get what you pay for here ie a (-)budget hotel. Having visited Amsterdam several times now  tried a few hotels ranging from 3*-5* this was I am afraid to say the most disappointing hotel yet.We were looking for a cheap/long-weekend break in October so booked a double room here. Don't be fooled by the web pics of the rooms here. Thankfully we were only staying 3 nights  were too busy out enjoying ourselves all day  late into the night to be bothered ruining our holiday by complaining. The double??? room we booked looked onto a nice courtyard. It resembled living in a cupboard. It would have been totally unbearable for a couple to live in this room for more than a weekend. If booked for a week we would have left!On opening the door...the double head-boardless bed was squashed hard up against the wall on one side  of course the door opened at the other side. Obviously this meant there was no room for bedside cabinets. There was no chest of drawers or storage in the room apart from a single MDF hanging wardrobe with only enough room to hang a couples jackets :-(  it had one small top shelf. This was between 2 adults on holiday! Obviously we had to keep all our clothes/underwear in our suitcases which we'd to constantly trip over to reach the sink as there was nothing big enough to put our suitcases on either.On going down to breakfast 1st morning, we were met with one available table which we could only describe as being left like a pig-sty by the previous people (not the hotel staff's fault). We sat perched on the end of the chairs  waited patiently for 15 mins before getting fed up waiting for someone to clear it so we moved to the next available table which was left cleaner. We'd then to ask the waitress for knifes and glasses, she'd to go and wash some as none were available. Also had to ask her to stock up on the self-service supplies ie milk and juice. Totally unorganised place. Heard others complaining about the bread  edges of cheese being hard. True. Similar problems the 2nd morning but thankfully the 3rd morning seemed far more organised, an older lady was on duty, with the young pleasant receptionist.1 waitress seemed to be manning the reception at the same time as cleaning tables  loading the dishwasher. She seemed pleasant but the other young waitress on duty the 1st couple of days seemed totally fed up, dour and disinterested Our bedroom room was on the 1st floor  directly above the dining room. Therefore from early hours we were subjected to the constant noise of the heavy wooden chairs grinding off the ceramic tiles as people got up  down. As this room was situated on the 1st floor you also get the constant noise of everyone walking up  down the stairs, slamming the shared toilet  shower doors etc. It was unbearable. The noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in. Shower  toilet facilities were clean though. Thankfully as we were out at night until all hours so we missed the night noise that others have mentioned. probably as we were always last in at night ;-) (couldn't bear to be in that room haha).Ideal hotel for students, or just a place to put your head down. I certainly would not recommend it for couples and we certainly wouldn't return again. Rooms are clean but it's disgraceful advertising it as a double  charging double rates. A total rip off. Amsterdam is wonderful place, great fun  more than made up for the disappointing, substandard hotel. Try Grasshoppers Bar, fab place.

The story begins......Friday 25th November me and 4 of my mates gets to the airport and jumps into an 8 seater (cost 35 Euro's) Direct to King Hotel.After having a delayed flight and not ariving to the hotel until 10pm our main aim was to get into the room and get straight out on the rown!We arrived at the hotel to a friendly welcome and booked in no problems at all all the staff very friendly!We then started the scary treck up the VERY STEEP STAIRS!! WARNING DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN OR IF YOU ARE NOT STEADY ON YOUR FEET!The stairs are very steep but as they are in all the Buildings in that particular area.The room. The rooms we were in was a twin and a triple ( i was in the triple) The room itself was not the Fantastic but what it was was a clean basic room with comfortable beds!! All we needed perfect for a 2 day stay!The shower room was good, clean and served the purpose, The breakfast was a typical COntinental style of a good standard (after we all drank them out of Orange Juice, Rehydration!!On the whole this is a very good hotel perfect locastion and very cheap!This isnt a classy hotel but really is PERFECT for a lads weekend and not really suited for families etc....Its worth a look here!! A1!! Thanks...

<Content>Not keen I stayed at the King Hotel last week. The room itself was very small, had a view of another hotel room opposite and not unlike a cell. I am used to basic accomodation, however this was a step too far as far as I am concerned. Granted the room was cheap relative to some of the other accomodation in Amsterdam, however the whole experience left me feeling a little ripped off (something that was compounded by the endless list of charges for such 'luxury' items such as a remote for the TV!) The location was good however as long as you don't mind a 15 minute walk to the center.

<Content>Not bad! King Hotel was our first hotel in a two week tour of Europe. It was a very nice budget hotel. We had a great view of a canal. The workers were friendly and helpful. They had all sorts of info available. It is on a quiet street, but there is a lot of noise from traffic on the other side of the canal. The only problems was that the stairs were steep and narrow and other people in the hotel were a little loud. But it is Amsterdam, and one should almost expect both. I could have asked the loud Germans to be quiet!

<Content>The Best for a Budget After reading the 2 reviews of this hotel, I thought I would write and add my opinion. After all, we need to have unbiased reviews to guide us on our travels.  As an exchange teacher, I wanted a hotel which was central and cheap for my 2 weeks off in early April. The King Hotel suited me fine. I had room #4, which was one step above street level and facing the canal. (You can see a picture of it on their website) It was a great room for a wonderful price. The tour boats drifted by, and the room had an exquisite ceiling with lots of Rococo work, and a fireplace which had a ledge to hold all of your souveniers. One double and one single bed. However, if you mind the late night screamer, this is not your room. You hear everything from the street.BUT, it is a quiet street. Rather unbelievable as it is just around the corner from the Liedesplein. Okay, so there a few rowdy Brits at 2PM, so what? It adds to the atmosphere.What I liked about the King Hotel was the security. It is an in and out hotel, if you know what I mean. I heard one poor soul trip on the steps at 3AM. However, they replace the plastic-holed computer room keys frequently, and you need a special key to get into the hotel and into your room. The stairs are steep. (But not to Room #4 which is only one flight of stairs)Breakfast can get monotonous after a few days...the good thing is they have boiled eggs (hot and hard) every morning. It appears to be run by Oriental people who are multi-lingual..quiet, polite and efficient. Received towels everyday, and sheets were changed when requested. If you're looking for the Ritz, this is not your hotel. However, I really liked it because it was good value for money and close to everything. The tram is around the corner...Boom Chicago and the Bulldog is a 4 minute walk around the corner. To find out where it is on the map, it is directly behind the American Hotel, which has excellent pea soup.I think people need to keep an open mind in Amsterdam...this hotel is one of those little canal establishments which is a delightful secret..'round the corner from the big boys, yet still scenic and pleasant. Yes, there are a few lager louts, but they come in late and don't make it to the 8-9:30 breakfast.

<Content>king hotel We are a young italian etero couple, king hotel did offer us a special rate then brought the price back to the origin and i had to call them back a dozen times to take evrything back to pacts, they put us in a really tiny room which was half space compared to all the other rooms in the hotel and the window was broken so we couldn't open it then the last three days even the heater broke, the worst fact is that a group of idiot german drunken guys did scream all night long for 3 nights and nobody told anything. I won't say this hotel is a ---, anyway they should care a little more about couples and give equal rooms to everyone, the price isn't lower than the service.
