<Content>Truly Awful If you are tempted to stay here based on the price and the location stop right now and find somewhere else.We had booked for three nights but checked out after one when even the guy at reception admitted is was old and dirty. We probably wouldn't have lasted that long if we hadn't arrived at midnight and had nowhere else to go. The walls desperately needed painting what little furniture there was was old and very run down and the noise from La Ramblas rattles against the inadequate single glazed windows. I didn't dare cook anything in the kitchen.I'm no hotel snob but this place is disgusting.

<Content>If only looking at location and price, this place is great! However, if things like cleanliness, clean drinking water, or noise until late at night bother you, like they did my family of four, DO NOT stay here. On the good side, the location is Fabulous. The recipionist does put on a decent act of friendliness, just don't exhaust it. And the beds were okay. On the bad side. The airconditioning is a joke. It either just didn't work at all, or wasn't worth trying to figure out how to run. In any case it was quite warm and humid in the room. The interior and floor are crying to be refinished. While not filthy, they were by not stretch of the imagaination 'clean'. The sink water was the worst. If it wasn't supposed to be drinkable, it sure didn't say so, but it sure tasted it came straight from the ocean. And to top it off, with the great location comes the great noise from Las Ramblas below, which is all fine and festive until 11pm when you would like to go to sleep. All in all we would never come back to this place, and like I said before, unless all you are concerned about is price and location, I highly recommend you stay away from this place as well.

<Content>Filthy and smelly We're a family of three from the United States, we stayed there for only one night and we were so glad it was only one night. It was the worst hotel we have ever encountered.The room was spacious, but was really old and dirty. The only clean thing in the room was the bed. The walls were peeling and emitted a musty smell. My husband tried to take a shower but the water was icy cold. One look at the bathroom and both my daughter and I would prefer to skip the shower instead of risking contracing nail fungus.We left the room for dinner, and by the time we came back the room was flooded with water. That explained the musty melling of the room. It was lucky for us since we put our luggages on chairs and table, otherwise our clothes would be ruined.The only thing nice about this hotel was the friendly and warm receptionist. He looked after our luggages after we checked out. I wish I had taken the warning and advices from other members before decide booking this hotel. I'd give the hotel a 1-star rating since I don't think there is any lower rating than a 1-star.This TripAdvisor Member: Liked 鈥?Right in the midlle of La Ramblas.Disliked 鈥?Everything else

<Content>Mur Mar Barcelona We have booked the apartment at Booking.com for a good rate, 86 euro per apartment, per night. The location is great! That's their best selling poing.But, inside the apartment it's really old. I closed the door of the kitchen because if you see how old and dirty this is, you can expect mice or rats in the apartment.They are cleaning it daily but it's so old and terrible that cleaning will not help. THe only thing what will help is a renovation.In the morning we had cold water, but after informing the front office, a day later it was warm.I will not recommend this hotel and i saw a lot of hotels because I am working at a travel agent.

<Content>Not Bad Spent 3 nights at the Mur Mar in December, it had its good points but it also had its bad points. First Off i will start with the good points:- The Apartment itsself was good. It has a seperate lounge, kitchen and bedroom so it is basically laid out like a one bedroom flat. The kitchen has all the facilities that you require and our appartment had a balcony which looked over the La Rambla. The location of the appartment is excellent if you want to be right in the heart of everything as it is right on the La Rambla and near to the Harbour.Now for the bad points:-The shower in the bathroom does not stay on the wall so you have to hold the shower over your head which can be a pain when all you want is a quick shower. The apartments themselves were absolutley freezing and didnt have any heating. In the summer i am sure this would be fine but it was 11 degrees outside and even then it was warmer outside than it was in the appartment. There is also a club across the road which comes out at 4am and the noise is unbearable. The shouting and screaming when on for about 3 hrs before it stopped.I would maybe stay at the Mur Mar again if it was in the summer but i would definatley not go back in the winter time again.

<Content>Great location but dirty Fantastic location overlooking La Ramblas. We had room 71, top floor with a huge balcony overlooking the street. I will admit the bedding and towels were clean but you did need to wear shoes after a shower or by the time you walked to the bed your feet were black. And as other reviews said can be very nosie on a Saturday night. The people beside us were told to leave 4 different times. Finally at 5am we were able to get some sleep. The only reason we didn't move to another hotel was due to the location and we were only here for 3 days plus so tired the first we didn't notice the dirtyuntil later.

<Content>mur mar was murrvelous! What a wonderful surprise this hotel was ! right on the most happening street in town,less than 1/2 block from a subway stop, short 2 block walk to the waaterfront....etc. It was clean and the staff was very helpful. Authentic retro decor. Can be a bit noisy on a Saturday night but hey, that's what they invented closing windows for.The price can't be beat either.In short , why stay anywhere else.
