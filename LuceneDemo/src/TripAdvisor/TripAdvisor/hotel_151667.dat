<Content>Up All Night Travelers looking for a place to sleep in Boqueron should think twice. (By the way Boqueron is nowhere near Ponce.) The main problem here is noise. On a quiet night, it might be ok, but tiny Boqueron is party central. The hotel is a stone's throw from the main drag. On the side facing the main street (Calle Jose de Diego), you will hear music blasted out by competing sound systems til at least 2am. On the other side, it's actually worse, because of an endless line of cars that drive by as long as the party keeps going. The hotel's windows have no glass, just screens and thin metal shutters, so you really hear the street noise, car alarms, voices, booming car stereos, engines gunning, etc. Neither the sound of the AC nor a set of earplugs had any chance against the level of noise here. We had the misfortune of being there on a holiday recently (Dia de Reyes, Jan. 5), and the party went on until sunrise. Apparently this is how it is in Boqueron on weekends and holidays, including many holidays that are obscure to non-Latin Americans. The night clerk was kind and helped us move to a slightly quieter room at 2:45am (the music stopped around 2, but resumed at 5:45am), but the day clerk, when asked why no one warned us that Dia de Reyes would mean an all-night party (even when I specified on the phone that we wanted a quiet room) replied that it is only the hotel's responsibility to inform clients of what facilities they offer, not to tell people about things going on outside the hotel. Thanks a lot. As for the facilities, they are pretty rustic for over $100 a night (no breakfast included). The pool is not heated; the TV gets about 8 low-rent cable channels, and the rooms, though spacious and acceptably clean, are very plain. When we arrived, our room had only two towels, though we asked for and got washcloths and a floor towel. The restaurant in the hotel is the nicest place in town, though nothing outstanding. It's too far to walk to the nearest beach. The only reason to consider this place at all is the lack of good alternatives in the Cabo Rojo area, which does have some nice beaches. We also stayed one night at the Bahia Salinas, which cost a good deal more, but was much nicer and certainly quieter (that wouldn't be hard). If you can afford that, it's a better option. We will not return to the Boquemar.

<Content>Loved the service hated the beds I stayed at the Parador Boquemar on July 19th through July 21st 2006 during my recent visit to Puerto Rico. The hotel came recommended through my Uncle and since we just walked in to inquire about vacancies I thought I would give it a try. The staff was very accommodating and very, very friendly but the beds in the rooms were like sleeping on bricks. I couldn't sleep comfortably my whole entire stay. Even though there was a storm and the power went out the Hotel was on backup generator which was plus. The beach is within walking distance and the place is somewhat centrally located. I would definitely want to stay there again if they replaced those brick beds. Let's just say my chiropractor wasn't too happy when I got back home to New Jersey.

<Content>Great Stay In the beginning of March my husband and son and I needed a getaway on a budget. I booked a weekend stay at the Boquemar than as an after thought I checked the reviews than I got nervous there are several negative ones. I am originally from New York and have stayed at really extravagant rooms. At first I guess due to the reviews I was thinking i've stayed in better places but after the first hour of settling in and venturing out I began to be happy we booked here. We took a family package, which was great because we had breakfast and dinner included at the Cascadas Restaurant the chef is extraordinay. The service was very good and the smiles were warm and welcoming. The beach close by was a dream. This a great place just to enjoy a layback moment. There are no clubs but a few pubs to hang out at. You must remember that this is a parador not a hotel, rooms are usually simple. The a/c was working just fine and the room was cleaned for us very well. After I started to feel at home we had to leave but I am looking forward to staying again. Oh just a hint if you want service to be a positive one greet your parador employees with respect and smile. If you order people around you will get that negative tone. Continue to enjoy Puerto Rico it really is a paradise.

<Content>Pesimo parador As many people that likes to do internal tourism in my island, I like to stay in hotels and inns of Puerto Rico. But my stay in the Boquemar Inn was unpleasant. First, the employee that manage my registration at the front desk was unprofesional. She looked like she was never happy with what she was doing. Second, the access ramp to the third floor looked like a labyrinth. Third, it seemed like somebody emptied a truck of ice on the pool. It was extremely cold. The air conditioning lack of conditioning was obvious, better said, the maintenance was lacking, since it did not chill. And finally the noise of the nearby pubs was unbearable and kept me awake at night.

<Content>Unpleasant experience In general, our experience was unpleasant. First, when me and my girlfriend called to make reservations, the employee, conveniently, forgot to tell us that there was a bikers convention that weekend at the hotel facilities. For obvious reasons, this is the kind of information that we expect to know before making a reservation, counting on the good faith of the hotel personel of course, specially if one object the roaring sound of a whole bunch of motorcycles just outside the hotel and the presence of leather wearing gang impersonators everywhere. Second, the lady employee at the front desk was indiferent, unfriendly and kind of rude, constantly asking for a confirmation number, even thou we explain that we do not have it with us at the moment. At that moment, we asked ourselves, is it so hard to look in the reservation records for our reservation, as she finally did?...In my opinion, there is little or no supervision of the front desk employees. Third, there was no hot water!...Can you believe it?...When we called the front desk to inform this problem, at 7:00 PM, the employee told us that the hotel was near full capacity and apparently, every guest was showering at the same time. In our frustation, we joked that maybe the bikers were washing their bikes all at once. Fifth, the location of the hotel allows all kind of loud music and noise from local pubs and bars in to the room even thou the room is air conditioned. This may be a good thing for a party looking guest, but not for the typical, rest and quiet looking person that visit the west coast of the island. Sixth, the pool area was unkept and the water was foul. And last, but not least, the fact that the administration stamped a piece of paper on the back of the doors of each room, explaining, for example, that if you steal a towel you will be billed $10.00 or if you steal the TV you will be billed $300.00 is a very rude and cheaply attitude. They should know that not all guests are thieves and robers. I can not comment about the restaurant because we decided to eat elsewhere, not wanting another bad experience. Finally, the hotel is too expensive for the value they offer. I have being experiencing the hospitality of the west coast of Puerto Rico for decades, specially the hotels in the bahia salinas area, and in my opinion, the boquemar experience was the low point.

<Content>there must be something better I stayed in hotels/inns throughout Puerto Rico in this price range and all were superior to this parador. The room was equipped but the staff could only be described as indifferent and there was a general drabness to the place. I must say that the location was perfect, in town and a 15 minute walk to the beach. We never even considered their restaurant since it was so dark and there are many cheerful, interesting places to eat in town.

<Content>Parador Boquemar was great Fellow Travelers, unlike the last and only entry in 2003 from the person in New York, we just got back from Cabo Rojo and had quite a different and positive experience at the Parador Boquemar. We followed the same itinerary as they did. We first stayed in Cabo Rojo, and then moved on to Rincon, Dorado and eventually back to San Juan. But I actually didn't want to leave Cabo Rojo, and regretted it later on. My boyfriend had been there before and stayed at the Parador Boquemar in 1985 when he was 10. He loved it, and the town of Cabo Rojo. So much so that he wanted to go back and re-create the experience all over again. The staff was helpful and friendly. Our room was on the 3rd floor and overlooked the pool and the ocean/bay filled with sailboats. We loved it. The room was clean and had a full bath, fridge and a/c. We requested clean towels each day, and they were given to us. I had to chuckle a little when I read the previous person write about the steep incline to the 3rd floor. There was a second set of stairs on the opposite side of the building, but he is right, it is definitely steep and even if you are in shape it does make you huff and puff to get up a level. We did not eat in the restaurant, but we would have had there not been so many other options in town. The Oysters were delicious, and did not affect me at all, and I have the weakest of weak stomachs. The beach that we ventured to was about 15 minutes away, driving over a very bumpy road. But once we got there, we found a crescent shaped beautiful beach with teal blue water and a lighthouse in the distance that you can climb to with spectacular views. We stayed at the exact same hotel in Rincon, the Villa Cofresi. It was overpriced and too touristy there. Then we moved on to San Juan?.it was awful. Dirty, rude and inconsiderate people...if you like casinos and high-rise type overpriced hotels, then definitely go there. We just loved Cabo Rojo and want to go back again very soon. We regret not staying there longer. Happy traveling!

<Content>Too basic for me, and the restaurant always runs out of fresh vegetables We had a crabby experience at this Parador. There is no elevator, but there is a ramp to the third floor which is very much like a ski slope in Austria. I was panting by the time I reached our room and the young men at the desk offered no help. The ramp is supposed to make the hotel accessible to people in wheelchairs, but it would take Arnold Swartzenneger to push a chair up that incline! We had dinner in the restaurant which has a Gastronomic designation from the Puerto Rico Tourism authority. That has to be a mistake. I was looking forward to Caribbean lobster, but all they had was frozen lobster from Africa which was done up in a cream sauce and quite good but, there was no lettuce for a salad, and no fresh vegetables. A large supermarket was nearby, and I wondered why someone just didn't go shopping and get fresh food. Breakfast was fine with a delicious and large serving of fresh papaya with eggs, bacon, ham or sausage and juice for $4.25. Boqueron is colorful. There are numerous small stands selling oysters and clams, but they are not refrigerated and I didn't dare eat shellfish that had been sitting in 80 degree weather for hours. Some of the vendors are very surly. When I asked the price of a small leather purse, the woman behind the stand barked out Five dollars! I did not buy the purse, and in fact we got out of there as soon as possible. We drove about two hours to Rincon and very thankfully checked into the delightful Villa Cofresi.
