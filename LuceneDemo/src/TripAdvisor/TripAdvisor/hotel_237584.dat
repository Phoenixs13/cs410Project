<Content>Quiet but insufficient Preety little hotel in a very quiet neighbourhood out of the centre of Amsterdam. Friendly stuff, but terrible breakfast and so small room! They changed every day our towels but never the sheets in 1 week!! My guide says it's a gay hotel but i haven't seen gays one week there. If u want a peacefull and relaxing environment and if u don't care so much about the breakfast i could recommend this hotel. But the change of the sheets cannot be neglected!

<Content>Even better the second time This was our second time visiting Amsterdam, and we chose to stay at the Sander again. The room we got was huge and newly refurbished- very nice. It looks like the one in the picture, with a wall of new windows, nicely tiled bathroom, big closet, faux fireplace, small sitting area, and spare twin bed. The breakfast was identical to last time- perfectly fine and tasty. The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet and a convenient jumping off point for getting to other parts of town. The staff made our stay very nice, too. We got help with bus routes, restaurant addresses, and taxi rides. There doesn't seem to be a bad person working there- they have all been very helpful and nice. On our second day there, we returned to find a small bottle of red wine and two glasses in our room, courtesy of the staff.We love Amsterdam, and we really like the Hotel Sander.

<Content>No Frills Hotel The best thing about this hotel is it's location - the Museum District - which is quiet and leafy, but not too far from the city centre and close to a tram stop. But the hotel itself left me cold. The included breakfast consisted of one boiled egg, some junky cereal and a few of junky carbs. The dining room was only used in the mornings, at breakfast time by the way. The rest of the time, the so-called dining room and bar were dead zones, and it wasn't possible to have an evening meal even if you were prepared to pay for it. This gave this hotel, a more BB feel.The room and bathroom were both small, pokey, and spartan there was very little storage space - although they were both clean. Use of the safe was at a nightly fee of 2.5 Euros. There was no tea or coffee facility in the room. The front door slammed very loudly throughout the night. I found the staff helpful but not very friendly as they generally looked bored and resentful. But at 90 Euros a night, I suppose you get what you pay for.Would I stay here again? The cheapness is a big plus since I don't see the point in spending a fortune on a room when I expect to be mostly out and about. But if it meant only paying a little bit more at another hotel in that district, I would gladly pay for a little extra comfort and a smile.

<Content>Great little hotel! We had a recently refurbished family room in this small hotel near to the Museums in Amsterdam. The staff were friendly and the hotel was clean and pleasant. The breakfast was limited in terms of choice but quite sufficient. The tram stop to the centre of the city is just around the corner making it an ideal place to stay.We had read some of the reviews and were a little concerned but would recommend it to anyone and would certainly stay again.Nice little hotel in a residential area so nice and quiet.

<Content>Hotel Sander Don't Go ! We have just returned from Amsterdam and stayed at this hotel, a word of advice don't go ! The number of complaints we haveare too many to be counted, it is too far from the city centre,breakfast is appalling and cheaply made, everything is done by penny pinching and it shows, good value for money not at all ! Curtains hanging by sticky tape in the rooms, no tea and coffee making facilities, dreadful. We would NEVER EVER GO BACKAnnie from Chester Feb 2007

<Content>Terribly dissapointed I had read good reviews of this 'hotel', but was terribly dissapointed when I arrived. It turned out to be a run down, none too clean, bed and breakfast establishment. My room was small and dim, with only a tiny light over the door, 2 tiny bedside lights and 1 even smaller desk light. The room was certainly warm, which was just as well as their was a howling gale coming in the window frame. The beds were clean and comfortable, the only really good thing. The shower room was clean enough, with plenty of hot water, but the air vent was disgusting. The furniture was rickity, I went to put my jacket in the cupboard, and took it out again as the cupboard was smelly. The breakfast is continental, and barely adequate. Why I say it is a bed and breakfast place is there is a bar, but the bar/lounge area and tiny reception area are closed and locked from 14.00p.m. in the afternoon, till 7a.m. the next morning, there are no staff in the hotel at all from this time, so what ever you do don't forget your room card, as it also unlocks the outside door, just make sure it works o.k. The hotel is certainly in a nice residential area, only 10-15 mins from the museums, and a further 5mins or so from the entertainment centre. This place is only sutiable for a very short stay, and not for the discerning traveller.

<Content>family friendly! We stayed for three nights in early november. The hotel is clean and quiet, and certainly family friendly, tolerating the little upsets and alarms of family life, like when we dropped a bottle of juice three stories, onto the conservatory roof... We had the family room, which was large and very nice. The hotel is close to the Concertgebouw and Rijksmuseum, and we enjoyed walking into the centre of the town each morning. Certainly recommended if you want to avoid the noise of other people having fun in the middle of the night in the middle of the town

<Content>Small, quaint, but a few problems too A very plain hotel. Clean albeit it spartan and a bit threadbare. There is a quad room upstairs if you are staying with a family- but during the summer this room gets HOT! Breakfast is simple and filling and the wait staff is pleasant. I was a bit unhappy that the property refused to consider any discounting for a longer term stay, so I stayed somewhere else.

<Content>Small rooms but friendly A small hotel for which a short tram ride (no.16) is required from city centre. This means it is a little cheaper than othrs. It is close to Concertgebouw and Vondelpark in fairly quiet residential street.The rooms are generally small, particularly for single occupancy, however they are clean if uninspiring. The staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is served in room overlooking small courtyard garden. There is a small bar. Recommended if you require no frills accommodation cheaper thn cty centre.
