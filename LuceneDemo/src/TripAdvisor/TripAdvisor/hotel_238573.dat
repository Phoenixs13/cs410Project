<Content>Worst Hostel experience ever. Not only were we suprised by how much the hostel cost for such an unclean and small place, but we also had money stolen from our suitcases and when we reported it the management suggested that we were probably stoned or drunk, neither which is true. The receptionist said it was impossible for something to be stolen since it is a family run business but i think if anything it is more likely because if you are related to the owner it is less likely he will fire you for stealing. The bathrooms were awful and i almost killed myself 10 times on the extremely narrow stairs. Reception was beyond rude and the only nice thing about this place was the location but i would rather stay 30 minutes outside of the city than have to deal with this family business.

<Content>thieves! do not stay here! This family run hotel stole cash from our suitcases and basically told us there was nothing we could do about it.! Booked this hotel as it was reasonably priced and in a good location near leidseplein. I knew not to expect the four seasons but ive stayed in many hotels before and this place is by far the worst ive seen.The rooms were tiny (even for amsterdam!) and filthy (brown stains on the sheets). Because it was a family run hotel and we were cleaning our own room so there was no need for the room cleaners to be in our room, we made the stupid decision to stash our money in the room. Over the course of the 3 days we had over 250 euro stolen from both mine and my girlfriends suitcases. Also our friends who stayed on a different floor had money stolen. By the time we had realised the money was gone there was no time to go to the police as we were leaving that day. I had heated words with the owners at reception but they informed me that the cleaners were family and would never do such a thing. But strangely they would not let me see the video of the security camera outside our room. I will be having words with these people when i return to amsterdam!

<Content>Stinky The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. It's not good to write reviews as lists but otherwise this would just be a rant from beginning to end.1. The hotel smells like a sewer, in the reception, in the halls and in the rooms.2. The rooms are dirty, the bathrooms are dirtier.3. The breakfast area is only big enough to seat 10% of the hotel guests. We were advised to be down on the dot of 7 o'clock if we want to eat.Please don't forget this is a 拢90 a night hotel, not a hostel. It's not in a central location and I'm not expecting any frills. What I do expect is a hotel that does not stink of [-] and a clean room and bathroom. How can hotels like this stay in business?

<Content>absolute disgrace First things first i know were in Holland and should expext steep stairs but they were a hazard you could barely fit your whole foot on a step, we had to pay them a deposit just to use the hair dryer, the double bed was just two singles pushed together, it was non smoking with penalty charges on your credit card if you dissobeyed, when you had a shower it flooded the whole toilet and last but not least there was a brown stain on the middle of one of the beds.... you can guess what it looked like.And all this for E98 a night, what a rip off, there would have been much better standards in a hostel

<Content>Terrible i found excrement on the sheets Me and Two friends stayed in a triple room this year and it was teh most traumatic experience of my life after a pleasant day of galavanting around the RLD Me and my chums decided to retire to our rooms for some backgammon, however upon entering Sarlacks Pit we noticed the room had a musty odour we heard screams of anguish coming from the bathroom and my friend lance said he had turned the tap on and excrement was coming out of the sink assuming it was blocked we tried to fix it but decided to leave it until the next day at around 2 Am a smell groped my sleeping body i turned the lights on and my pillow and sheets had more excrement on i complained to the desk who said they would sort it in the morning and told me it was late and i should try to get some sleep so i had to sleep in the wardrobe, the second day lance feel down the stairs which were like mount everest and damaged his leg therefore ruining our plan for that night in the RLD, the breakfast was awful and the waiter often broke wind as he handed us our food and plates, th eone plus was the vista from our window until i noticed 2 men one urinating and one throwing up against the wall just feet below us all in all i was dissapointed in the extreme i wanted a nice fun getaway and in th eend i stayed in a smutty back door shambles of a place, one mor ething i must add to travellers this place is dangerous the area is full of drugs and many loals were surprised you can stay in thsi area also the doors on the rooms have no locks and you are advised to take all possesions with you including luggage all day!!!! AVOID !

<Content>superb location On the positive side, this hotel is in a fantastic location for you to explore some of the essential attractions amsterdam has to offer. Anne Franks House is about a 15minute walk, (try and get there early to safe waiting in a very long queue). Check out the lovey cafe adjacent to the museum also. The Van Gogh Museum is also about 15 min walk and the Rijksmuseum. You will be in a place called Liedesplein which is like a mini slice of London's West End in the evening, there are some very good restaurants, (fantastic greek restaurant called Mykonos) and bars and clubs if that's what you're looking for.It's incredibly easy to get around, 5 minutes from the hotel the tram service will connect you to many places around amsterdam. It takes around 15 minutes to Central Station, and a further 15 to Schipol airport.The staff are very friendly and helpful, little problems were attended to, i.e.to change a light bulb, needing more towels etc.The breakfast is certainly fine to get you started for your day. It's a 'help-youself' service to toast, a selection of preservatives, boiled eggs, slices of cheese, ham, coffee, tea. You can have as much as you wish.Lovely views of the canals from the bedroom window, there is also a locker service to put your passports, valuables in for a deposit of 鈧?0 (refundable) which is worth using.On the negative side, don't expect the Hilton! When you first enter your room it maybe a little grim. Old carpets, stained, very old tatty 1940's wall paper. The rooms could do with a little more va va voom. Also, be prepared for the smallest bathrooms in the world. If your tall, you may struggle using the toilet with the limited leg room, but you'll manage. Our twin room had a toilet, sink and shower. However, the shower is powerful and has constant hot water day and night. Not a fault of the hotel, just archictecture in amsterdam generally, be prepered for the very steep, narrow, and at first rather intimidating stairs you will have to negotiate. If you have any physical ailments, it may be best to ask for a room on the first floor.The walls are rather thin and you can hear other people walking up and down the stairs, or even in their rooms. If your a light sleeper, take some ear plugs just in case. However generally we found it quiet and a pleasure to sleep.To sum, this is a low budget hotel, in which its highlight is the prime location. It's relatively clean, your linen and towels will be changed, good breakfast. It's only a place to sleep and eat because you'll be out exploring Amsterdam for most of your trip.

<Content>Respect my privacy. When I book a low budget hotel I don't expect a five star room or service: the room was simple, not perfectly clean, but big for Amsterdam standards; the bathroom was really small and the shower didn't have a curtain, and it was impossible to not flood all.But the thing that bother me really was the housekeeping service.The waitress never knocked before entering the room and once she found me naked after the shower (it was impossible to avoid embarassing situations because she didn't came never at the same time).Also, when she cleaned the room while we were out, she always left the door open. Luckly the only valuable thing that I had was only the camera, that i carried with me everyday, so nothing was missed, but this isn't a good excuse for that unforgivable negligence.

<Content>Great location, but bring warm clothes! For a 4 bedroom room for the cost of about 17.50GBP per person, we couldn't go far wrong. Rooms were provided with a free towel (remember to hang these to dry, as they are not changed) and the breakfast was a nice and simple (toast and boiled eggs). Staff were friendly, but we were left not knowing what the hostel had to offer at all, and so did not use any of the services.The hostel is only a short walk from the Van Gogh museum and the Anne Frank House.If you plan on going in the winter, our radiators gave out very little heat indeed, so take your sleeping bag liners or extra layers!

<Content>Overpriced Well, usually I say one gets what one pays for - however not in this case.The hotel is a two-star standard, so one couldn't expect that much, although maybe cleaning some time during the four day stay? No change of bedding, no adding of soap etc. in the bathroom - I had to go and ask for more toilet paper.Breakfast included, I wouldn't say bad, however very very very basic. Coffee and some toast, if you don't come too late :)Staff a bit uncommitted.The web site of the hotel said they had parking spaces, however this is taken care of in such way that they call a car hotel for you. They come and take your car and park it somewhere else; although the price is lower than parking on the street, I was quite worried to give my car to strangers.At about 100 鈧?per night I feel like I've been had. The prices generally are high in Amsterdam, and it seems like many people want to get a piece of all tourists.

<Content>Fine, considering the price We booked two double rooms for three nights in June, which worked out at only 530 euro between the four of us. Both rooms, although small, were clean and tidy with comfortable beds. The en-suite WCs were tiny, but they beat sharing a shower-room with a bunch of complete strangers at a youth hostel. The reception staff were all friendly enough, and like everyone else in The Netherlands they spoke perfect English. We didn't ever have breakfast in the hotel so I'm afraid I can't comment on the food, but it did smell good!One word of caution, though; if you go to the hotel's own website, don't use the location map, which somehow they've managed to get wrong. The hotel is on Leidsegracht, but it's actually on the corner with Marnixstraat, just off the Leidesplein. This is a great location; pretty central with all the usual tourist sights within easy walking distance, and regular trams from Leidesplein if you're lazy.So yah, in summary; a good budget hotel in a great location, perfectly okay for a cheap place to sleep on a student citybreak. We'd all stay there again.

<Content>Excellent service My family consisting of 9 members arrived this hotel on the evening of 5th Jun 2007. A male staff was manning the reception. He was friendly and polite. During our short stay in this hotel, he allowed us to boil water, use the dinning area and kitchen. We needed to prepare our own food as we have young kids whom needed special diets.Though this hotel is old and the rooms are small, what impressed us is the additional and personal touch given by this male staff. My mother was unwell. I seeked help from him. Although the medicine in the first aid box was limited, he specially brewed thick coffee for us. He was very caring, understanding and attentive to the needs of the guests. This is what a guest needs especially when overseas. He has done an excellent job.(PS: I am sorry that I could not remember his name)

<Content>A mouse ran across the floor! Booked through STA. When we opened the door to our room, a mouse scampered across the floor! It ran into the room somewhere, instead of out, so we complained and were moved to a different room. New room was decent, but the bathroom was awful. There was a shower head in the wall, but no separation between it and the rest of the bathroom (not even a curtain), therefore, every time we took a shower the entire bathroom got wet. Also, since the hotel is in a typical row house, the stairs are very steep and there is no elevator. Climbing and descending several flights of stairs to your room is not for the faint hearted. Overall, I would say that you can find a better hotel for the price we were paying!

<Content>Good for the price My boyfriend and I booked this hotel for three nights as part of a cheap city break during the Easter holidays. The price of the room was 255 euros including breakfast and the city tourist tax, which was very reasonable for the area, especially since the rooms are all en-suite.The room was small and basic although we were out pretty much all day every day so only needed the room for a comfortable place to sleep. However, the bathroom was a little problematic as the shower emptied far slower than it filled which meant we almost flooded the bathroom on a couple of occasions.Overall, it's a good, cheap place to stay in Amsterdam and it was in a nice area near Leidsplein. The hotel was also very close to a tram stop where the number 1, 2, or 5 tram could take you to Dam Square or the Central Station very quickly which was very convenient, especially aftter a long day.

<Content>Better than a Blackpool B+B We wanted to go and see family in the city and enjoy the Queen Mothers Birthday weekend at the same time. We wanted a change from staying with the family but wanted to be central to join in the party and see the relatives. Nearly every hotel we tried was booked up or way to expensive and de Lantaerne was cery cheap and available. With this in mind we booked expecting a Blackpool B+B standard but could believe our eyes when we got there. It was really chilled out, nice and tidy much cleaner than any Blackpool hotel (Im from there so have seen a few) and with a really great location. We use it regularly to visit family if we are planning a party break in the city. If you are a fussy traveller stay away- leave it free for down to earth folk.

<Content>Awful I made a reservation to stay in this hotel for two nights. Two days prior to my arrival they called to tell me that they only took bookings for three nights over the weekend. I explained ad nauseum that they took my booking for two nights and thus should honor it. They refused. I sucked it up, told them I'd pay for an extra night I wouldn't use, at which point - get this - they told my reservation had been canceled the day before. To top it all off they charged my credit card for a no-show on my original arrival date! Outrageous!

<Content>Considering what we paid it was excellent! We booked the hostel because it was cheap. The reviews weren't all good and we expected the worst - but we weren't bothered because we only intended to sleep there! We booked a room for 5 people. It was split into 2 rooms with a connecting door - there was a shower room and an extra sink. The room was basic, we had beds with white sheets and pillow/duvet covers, white towels and a TV. The towels were changed every day and the hostel was clean.The breakfasts were good with bread/toast, cheese, ham, jams, apple or orange juice, tea and coffee and fresh boiled eggs. We only paid 拢45 per person for B+B for 3 nights. The location was really good - so we thought it was a bargain!!!

<Content>this is a good value, decent hostel, recommended :) stayed at this hostel 3 nights - 2 nights at the beginning of our holiday in a triple room  our last night in a double room. The first room was on the 4th floor - im glad i dont suffer from vertigo!- it did add to the amsterdam experience but wasnt great for my arthritic knee, but hey, you expect tall buildings in amsterdam. second room was in an adjoining building, room faced the street which was a wee bit noisy but a very comfortable room. both rooms were clean, with tv and ensuite, and really close to leidseplein. it was great to be able to come back to the room, chill out have a smoke  a beer  watch odd dutch tv! i was delighted at the standard of accomodation especially considering the price, and will definitelybe staying here again!

<Content>avoid like the plague we booked 2 double rooms. when we arrived, we were told we had to pay up front which we did, when we entered our rooms, what a shock, the rooms were nothing like the ones shown on the internet and I could not believe that people stayed in them, the toilet was broken, the bedding was dirty and covered in holes, the wall light was hanging off the wall and the window opened everytime you opened the door to your room. We complained and was basically told that we had already paid and tough. I have been e-mailing Sultan, the owner and he could not care less, stating that the hotel has now been renovated and we cannot complain, it WAS NOT renovated when we stayed. I would not have kennelled my three dogs in the rooms they were disgusting. The top floor has no fire escape and is so steep, you need oxygen when you get to the top, the carpet sticks to your feet and basically the place needs demolishing. if you want to stay in a totally run down [--], then this is your place, we walked out of the dump and stayed at IBIS hotel which was absolutely superb. DO NOT STAY IN THIS HELL HOLE

<Content>Don't Believe the bad reviews! WE LOVED IT!! After booking this hotel, (which is very very competitively priced) my girlfriend and I we shocked to see lots of bad reviews. I don't know what the other people were expecting from a hotel that charges about 拢17 a night, but we thought this place was lovely. Yes there are no lifts (but derrr, you're in Amsterdam, everywhere has very steep stairs and no lifts) but the exercise will do you good (we were on the 4th floor...that's 83 stairs :)The room was clean and warm, the breakfast was filling (toast, ham, cheese, boiled eggs, jam, coffee etc) and the people were friendly. If you're expecting all mod cons then makes sure you go somewhere that charges you 3 or 4 times more.I will definitely be going back here, the location was great, and you can smoke in your room :)We have already recommended it to some friends and are looking forward to going again at easter.Please ignore all the other reviews that seem to be written by fairweather travellers. For the money, you really can't go wrong with this place.Enjoy!

<Content>just ok We arrived quite late to the hotel but got checked in very quickly and paid up front.Please be aware that there is no lifts in this hotel and if you have large suitcases you will struggle up the very very steep stairs!!The rooms are small but we were out most days so to sleep in they were fine, we got clean towels everyday but i do admit the rooms could do with a fresh lick of paint and new bathrooms as there is a few chipped tiles and mould on the walls, and after 3days in the room the bathroom smelt really bad from the drain in the shower.The location of the hotel to dam sq is about 20mins walk away but about 5mins away from some good bars and restaurants. The hotel is opposite the police station but we very rarely heard sirens from there and most of the rooms have nice views of the canal. For what i paid i don't think i would go back it is a basic hotel, amsterdam is fantastic though.

<Content>3 dees Our second trip to Amsterdam and my sister and brother in law's first trip. We booked the hotel from the internet and had great difficulty in booking two rooms with facilities due to a concert by Madonna and a football match. We finally booked at de Lantaerne 2 rooms but had our misgivings about it being only one or two star. We arrived Monday 04 in the afternoon and was charged E 345 for four nights. We were handed the keys to Room 18 and Room 40. Our misgivings were right. The rooms are small, not very clean and desperately in need of decoration. The beds and bedding are very shabby as is everything else at the hotel. Room 40 was top of the house in the attic, just a double bed and tiny bathroom, no cupboards or wardrobes. We complained immediately, and whilst they were able to move us the next day to room 7 next to reception, we endured one night in what I can only describe as a cell. Room 7 was equally shabby as was the bathroom, although there was always hot water. The dining room is equally shabby and served the same cold breakfast every morning without fail, the only hot items were coffee, water for tea and toast from a toaster that occasionally worked, oh and cold hard-boiled eggs. We would not recommend a trip to this hotel, you would do better going to a student hostel .MR  MRS NOLAN-CLARKE

<Content>hen weekend hotel nighmare! My friend booked the hotel for her hen weekend. When we got there, they said they had no record of the booking we had made for 2 rooms. My friend then had to prove she had made the booking by calling her boyfriend back in the UK. Eventually they said they had our booking, but the rooms we booked were not available. We were put in a room for 5 and one person had to sleep on the floor. They charged us full rate. We had a groundfloor room and the window locks were broken. The shower/bathroom was mouldy. My friend has found out this week that they have taken extra money off her credit card. The customer service was really poor and the rooms we had were not very nice.

<Content>OK, but . . . As per many of the other reviews what makes this place a good hotel is the location and its proximity to Leidseplein, however please note that it is a major hike from the central train station and the red light district. The stairs are steep so be prepared if you have a lot of luggage. Also the rooms a very simple and small but it鈥檚 not like your going to be hanging out in your room all day. The only negative thing I have to say is that although they claim to take AMX they actually do not! So even if you book with an AMX, like I did, once you get there they only take Master Card or cash. A huge inconvenience for me while I was there, thus the somewhat negative review.!

<Content>terrible customer service I booked to stay here for a hen weekend. First they messed up the booking so we arrived on Friday to be told we were not booked in. They were very unhelpful and I had to phone my boyfriend back in Scotland to confirm the booking. They then made us pay the same amount for a shared room for 5, as 2 rooms for 2 and 3. The room was terrible, one bed was a mattress on the floor, the showerroom was mouldy. To top this off, they have taken a charge on my credit card which was used to hold the room. The staff were unhelpful and I ended in tears over the mix up.

<Content>great value for money I have just come back from 3 nights in amsterdam on a stag weekend. we stayed at the lantaerne, there were 15 of us in total and the hotel was very welcoming to a large group.The hotel is located in the centre of the nightlife, with easy access to the tram. It has clean bed sheets and towels every day, the staff are extremely nice, always similing and helped us with directions etc.The hotel was very cheap compared to other hotels in amsterdam, it was more like the price of a hostel than a hotel. It was definately great value for money, very basic in every way, but a brlliant place to stay if you just want somewhere to rest your head.

<Content>perfect location What's that saying... you get what you pay for? This hotel / hostel is in a brilliant location only a few minutes walk away from all the great eateries and bars and the tram stop. It's about 10 minutes walk from the heineken brewery and even less to the Hard Rock cafe. The staff are SO helpful and the breakfast is just what you need to set you up for the day (bread / toast, ham, cheese, salami, jams, coffee etc). The beds were really comfy and was a great nights sleep. The only problem was the decoration in the rooms - a bit of damp on the floor and ceilings 'cause they haven't water-proofed the shower rooms. The stairs are REALLY steep - so you have been warned.

<Content>We won't be back My wife and I had booked four nights at the Lantaerne but left after two. The staff were quite nice and the lobby cat was cute and friendly, but the room was unacceptable. Younger people and backpackers would probably tolerate the room. First, the stairs (no elevator) are very steep and narrow. The room was tiny, the carpet was worn, there were exposed electrical wires hanging from the ceiling, the bed was old and uncomfortable, the hook where the shower head hung was broken so we had to use one hand to hold the shower head when showering, and there was no shower stall so the water fell to the floor of the tiny bathroom where it drained out. The hotel is located in a fun and busy area, but with no a/c and the window open, we heard revellers all night long. A canal-view room cost 85 Euros (about $100) and included a basic cold cut and bread breakfast. Rooms without a canal view were 80 Euros. They charge a few Euros more if you pay by credit card.

<Content>We'll be back! A great place to stay in Amsterdam. My boyfriend and I were here for eight nights and will definitely come back next time around. It was charming, had a great location, felt very secure, and didn't cost all that much.The location: Hotel De Lantaerne is right next to Leidseplein, a busy square which is (conveniently) a stop on several trams. Bars, restaurants, cafes and coffeeshops are all within a five-minute walk. In the foyer there is a table set up with advertisements for lots of different attractions in Amsterdam, some with coupons. Free maps (and advice) can be obtained at the front desk. The staff: The front desk is manned 24 hours a day, friendly and willing to answer questions. Housekeeping cleans the room and delivers fresh towels in the late morning or early afternoon. The attendant who sets up the breakfast spread keeps everything clean and filled.  The room: In terms of size, our room was on the small side, but so what? We didn't go to Amsterdam to hang out in our hotel room! Still, it was very clean and attractive, with large sunny windows and adequate storage space. We got a double bed, which was really two twin beds pushed together, but again, it didn't really matter to us at all. It was very comfortable. There is a television (not that you'll probably use it, though I do recommend Dutch MTV). We had our own small bathroom-- toilet, sink, and shower. Breakfast: Our room rate included breakfast, served from 8:30 to 10:00. It's a spread of white and dark bread (there's a toaster), ham, salami, cheese, hard boiled eggs, various jams and condiments, coffee, tea, orange juice, and milk. We were on a budget, so we tried to fill up here most mornings to save a little money. The food was very good quality, although it is exactly the same every day. You might get sick of it, but then again you always know what to expect. Security: To get into the hotel you must be buzzed in by the front desk or you can use your key-card. This key-card also lets you into your room. There are free security boxes in the lobby if you want them, I didn't use them. I felt totally safe here, and comfortable leaving my stuff in my room. As a woman, I wouldn't hesistate to stay here alone. I felt very safe in the hotel as well as in the city in general. Smoking: Allowed. There are ashtrays in the rooms and next to the computers in the lobby. Internet: There are two computers with high-speed access right in the lobby. You pay a couple of euros for half an hour.Cost: It cost us about $45 (American dollars) each; so, a little under $100 a night total for the two of us. We considered staying in a hostel, but I didn't relish the idea of sleeping in a room full of strangers or sharing a bathroom. This only cost a little more, and it was infinitely more comfortable and private. We made our reservation online about a month in advance. This was during the beginning of Amsterdam's peak tourist season (early June.) The Stairs: Yes, it's true. As the nice guy at the front desk put it when he checked us in, Um, we have some stairs. To my American eyes, at first they looked shockingly steep. But by the end of the week I was flying up and down them and actually kind of grew to appreciate their quirky European character. It's a little tricky dealing with your baggage, but not as bad as it might seem. I'm not sure how many floors there are, four I think, and I was on the 2nd. There is no elevator.The Cat: The hotel lobby is home to a sweet little elderly kitty named Pous-Pous. That means cat-cat in Dutch. According to the staff she's at least 19 years old, possibly even in her 20's. If you can, please give her a kiss for me! I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Nothing like the website Hotel Lantaerne is not the greatest hotel on this planet. The location is pretty good and if you are only just looking for a place to sleep this is the place for you.It would make a big difference if they could at least vacuum the hotel every once in a while. The beds are about 20 years old and don't expect any nicely decorated rooms. The bathroom is minute and there are no shower curtains so you end up with a nice wet bathroom everytime you take a shower.The biggest dissapointment is the fact that the photos on their website tell a very different story all together.If you are looking for value for money - this hotel is not for you. Amsterdam is great - this hotel is NOT.

<Content>Great Location My Husband and I stayed here in September on our trip to Amsterdam. The location of the hotel was AWESOME. You couldn't be located closer to the party!!! We loved the location.The hotel.... eh.... it is not a nice hotel, but it is reasonably priced and the sheets were clean. The rooms were small, the carpet old, and the wallpaper was peeling a bit in our room, but it was very clean.Make sure you get a room with a canal view, otherwise the sun will be beating in the window. We slept with the window open. It was not loud. There were no bugs. I would stay here again. It's a budget hotel.

<Content>A dump with a great location The room I stayed in was a dump. It was summer, it smelled bad, bugs were a problem since there are no screen in the windows (you have to leave them open since no a/c). The people running the place are great and friendly and it could not be in a better location, the breakfast was very good, they have a nice bar and deck to sit out on. This would be a jewel if they put in screens, used a little bleach in the bathroom and replaced the very smelly carpet.
