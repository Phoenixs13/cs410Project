<Content>Dump One of the worst accommodations I have ever stayed at. Although the exterior look fine the interior was terrible. The lobby smelled of mildew and who knows what else plus it was littered with junk in the halls. The room on the 3rd was stark. It had a fan and small fridge. The bathroom ceiling was falling apart and had the smallest sink I've ever seen. Barely wide enough to dip your hand in. I'm sure if filled it couldn't hold more than a cup of water. The room faced the noisy street. Had there not been a fan it would have been unbearable.To get to downtown one could take the bus which ran hourly or take a 45 minute. We selected this hotel only because there was nothing available at the time and at our price range. After 2 nights we did find f excellent accommodations at the Travelodge Sydney Hotel which ideally located and clean and for a lesser priceAs this hotel is part of the Budget Motel chain, I question what the minimum standards are required to qualify. The only positive comments about this place was that the hostess was helpful and there were no bedbugs.
