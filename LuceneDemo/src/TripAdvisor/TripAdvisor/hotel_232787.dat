<Content>Small, friendly, utilitarian hotel in good central location Hi all potential Barcelona travelers. I studied up on Barcelona hotels (on tripadvisor of course) and was relatively happy with my selection of the Onix Fira where I stayed for 4 nights in July while attending some business meetings. The Onix Fira is small and quite utilitarian. In other words, it's a nice clean simple hotel with a decent breakfast (free if you pay for it in your room fee) in a pretty good location. The hotel is within very short walking distance of the central train station, and also Placa Espana which has many col sights left over from various Olympic and world expo experiences.I was within about a 15 minute walk of an LDS church which was nice to find on Sunday morning. And also about 3 minutes walk from the Placa Espana metro/subway from where you can pretty much get anywhere else in Barcelona. The room was small by American standards, but did have a working TV, wireless internet connection, and locking safe. All you need when traveling on business. Though I suppose that if I was traveling with my wife I might want something a little fancier? or maybe not. I was able to get downtown in just a few minutes on the metro, so no point in staying in a hotel right downtown.There was still quite a bit of construction next door as they continue to renovate one of the two historic bull fighting rings in town into, yes, a shopping mall!

<Content>Very Basic I stayed in the Onix Fira with my boyfriend for a long weekend, the room was clean but very very basic, so its Ok i guess for a place to crash after a full day out. We were meant to have a double bed, but it was actually two single beds put together. There was free internet access all the time in the reception and it is 3 metro stops away from Place de Catalunya which is the city centre. On their website it says that there is a small rooftop swimming pool, but saying small its an exageration, its the size of an avarage bath tub. Our room was on the first floor, about 50 metres from the old Bull Arena, which was under construction so a lot of noise ! there s a tiny balcony but obviously not a nice view, just buildings and traffic. The staff didn't go any extra miles to make you feel welcome so alltogether very very basic. I d love to go back to Barcelona, if i do, i ll defenetly look for another hotel, as for 鈧?00 for 3 nights we might find something cosier ...

<Content>TWO STAR HOTEL tHE ONIX FIRA is just a two star hotel. The location is good, plaza de espana. There is a metro station 100 meters. The room is simple, they have a extra charge to use the safe system in the room. The breakfast is normal. I woul not stay here again. I would try B hotel that is just on the corner.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, and in a great location. The Onix Fira is a nice modern choice in central Barcelona. I travel with my computer, and free wireless internet in this hotel was a big bonus. The rooms are bright and spacious, the air-co works well, and the staff are helpful and courteous. 2 main metro lines are just around the corner. Good for families, the (very) small rooftop pool is a plus, as is the nicely appointed breakfast area on the ground floor. We'd return here on our next trip.

<Content>Could have been better I stayed at this hotel in September 2006 for 3 nights. My room was clean and spacious, I booked a double (two singles pushed together) as the prices were almost the same as if you booked a single. Lots of storage space as well as safe in room. The other great thing was that there were locks on your wardrobes so u could lock up all your belongings. Bathroom was large with a bath/shower. There was also free wi-fi which was great as it was a low cost option which enabled me to keep in contact with my family overseas!Now the downsides! My minibar was not working and was not repaired in all the time I was there - even though I reported it on the first day of arrival. Located on the end of a small street, facing a large construction site. Luckily they do not work on Saturday or Sunday so there was no noise or dust to contend with. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to traveller's who don't speak spanish because my very very limited Spanish and the staffs very very limited English made any form of communication difficult, even checking in! Location wise - it is alright. Right near the Placa Espanya and the montjuic area which has a number of tourist attractions there to visit. Ok hotel, but for the price I think I would find another hotel next time I return to Barcelona.

<Content>Nice quiet place I've stayed here at least a dozen times, and find the place perfectly fine. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the Onix, but then again there's not much to the place either. It's on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood near Placa de Espanya and the train station, just behind a Miro-sculpted park. The rooms are comfortable, if a bit on the spartan side. But the elevators work great, the air conditioning is superb, and every room's got a tiny balcony on which to have a drink at the end of a hot Barcelona day. The lobby bar is great for a morning coffee or a quick snack, but I certainly wouldn't have a full meal there. Plenty of places within 20 minutes walk to get a fabulous lunch or dinner.You can walk to the Plaza Espanya subway station in under 5 minutes, and reasonably-priced taxis are almost always hovering nearby.Staff are pleasant and fairly knowledgeable. If you're going to need an early check-in, let them know ahead of time and they'll try to accommodate it. Sometimes they can't, and they'll be happy to store your luggage until there's a vacant room. All in all, this picky New Yorker was satisfied. If you're looking for luxury with frills and extra service, go to someplace like the Fira Palce or the Hotel Arts. But I like the Onix just fine.

<Content>OK hotel but not the best location I do not have any complaints about this hotel except location. I like to be right in the town when I walk out of a hotel, but here I was almost in the middle of nowhere. It is true that it is near the old bullring, but it is under construction right now so the views are terrible. Hotel rooms are clean and confortable, breakfast excellent, service fine. However, I think it would be better to be located near Plaza Catalonia, Cathdral or near Passage de Gracia.

<Content>Near the train station We stayed at the Onix because it was within walking distance of the train station. We walked there in the early morning to catch the train to Madrid. Decent place. Rooms fine. Near the old bullfight and the Miro park as stated, but we liked it for its proximity to the train station. The Dukar rally was starting in Barcelona around the time we were there so the hotel was full of fans or participants.

<Content>Onix was great We stayed a couple nights in May, 2004, and the place was great all around. A nice little in-room refrigerator stocked with drinks, olives, nuts (for purchase, of course). Very comfortable room. One block from subway station.

<Content>Great value for what it is I love this hotel - great value for what it is. Low key. Most (all?) rooms have a little balcony, the ones at the front have a view over the Miro Park and there's a tiny pool on the roof. Central enough (who actually wants to stay in the Ramblas anyway?).

<Content>Never book for to stay at this hotel My partner and I arrived in Barcelona after travelling from Malaga on a 14 hour train journey to arrive at this hotel only to find they had cancelled our reservation. They informed us that we had to be at the hotel by 6.30pm when we had all ready informed them by telephone and email that we would not be arriving until 9.30pm. They had our credit card details therefore they should not have cancelled our room but they kept insisting that they did not have any details and the woman on reception just did not want to know. A very distressing day for us, as we then had to find somewhere to stay for the night not knowing the city at all.

<Content>We loved the desk clerks and the location. Right around the corner from the old bull ring, this hotel bent over backwards to accommodate my friend who is a paraplegic and wheel-chair bound. The hotel is within walking distance of the National Art Museum which has a spectacular light, water and music show on Thursdays (and weekends?).There is a small cafeteria/bar attached to the hotel which was very convenient.Great place, great people.
