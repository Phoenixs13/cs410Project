<Content>Hotel Stanza: a decent place to stay in Col. Roma Nte. We usually like to stay in the Centro Hist贸rico, but on our return from the U.S wanted to be in Colonia Roma, so we could experience a new area as well as walk to friends' house.The Hotel Stanza was more than adequate; the lobby was smoky but tolerable; the room we had was very spacious, airconditioned and had a large bathroom. There were two minir flaws: the wi-fi connections were constantly interrupted, and when I put my laptop in a cabinet, the door fell off!Rather than eat at the attached Wings Restaurante, we opted for the flagship Bisquets Obreg贸n, which while nothing special, served decent food at affordable prices.The staff was helpful and largely bilingual.It's a good option if you wish to stay in Colonia Roma Norte. (By the way, we didn't notice any bad smell as mentioned by a previous reviewer. That may have been a temporary problem.)

<Content>Got much more than my money's worth I am a returning customer to the hotel. I had arrived to Mexico City, this second time, to start postgraduate studies. I worried about my safety and cost. I can honestly say I got more than my moneys worth.Bus and subway stations are nearby. There are restaurants, where one I could dine cheaply and plentifully. My extra baggage was stored at no additional cost. I would leave my laptop at the receptionist's counter and they would send it to me quickly to my room if I needed so. Customer attention was admirable. I had reserved a room with fan, but some how it was given to someone else. I thought I would have to look for another place to stay, since no charge had been done to my credit card. All I carried was my email with the hotel's address. Nevertheless, they placed me at a higher rated room throughout my stay at no further cost.I have decided to return there as soon as I can. Just one thing, breakfast is not included and that is inconvenient if you are an early bird.

<Content>Great Hotel for the Entire Family!! During our first stay at Parque Ensenada, we experienced such a great time. The hotel is conveniently located a couple of minutes away from historical sites. It's practically 10 minutes away from the Angel de la Independencia. The staff is just wonderful and polite, very courteous. To whoever wants a good hotel for a very REASONABLE price, Parque Ensenada will be a great choice.

<Content>Excellent value Excellent value in its category. I stayed for a week in business and I enjoyed the hotel very much. Very clean, good size rooms, beautiful bathtroom and a very convenient location. Very helpful staff and the restaurant Wings good value and quality food and service. I would not hesitate to recommend it. I will use it as my hotel for future trips. I did have an executive single without A/C, but next time I will pay a little extra for the A/C, it is necessary for warm days and nights for us from the north. Not all rooms are air conditioned, although a big fan is provided. The electronic safe in the room very convenient, as is the mini bar, without the normally expensive prices. Enrique Schonfeldt
