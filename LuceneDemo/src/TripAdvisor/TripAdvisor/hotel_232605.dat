<Content>Good hotel Stayed her for 3 nights in Oct 2006. Modern hotel. Very helpful receptionists. We paid 95 euros a night including breakfast. Breakfast was continental and cooked, very good selection. I think it's probably used more as a business hotel. Very clean, good sized hotel room, shower /bathroom good size. Can't fault it. 5 mins walk away are bars/restaurants. We walked everywhere from here and didn't think that it was too far out, obviously you could use tram/metro but we chose to walk. Would recommend staying in this hotel.
