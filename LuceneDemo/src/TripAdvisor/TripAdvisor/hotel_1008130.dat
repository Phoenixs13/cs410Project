<Content>Great hotel in great location. Loved this hotel !! It is in a fantastic location, is beautifully designed, has fantastic services and staff. The beds are wonderful, as are the showers and bath. Staff are friendly and pleasant.We thoroughly enjoyed unwinding in our room after an exhausting day discovering the city. As with some other reviews my only gripe was the useless sinks, beautifull design but not practical. I would say that this hotel is definately more suited for either a single traveller, or young/open minded couple. As you have probably gathered the bathrooms are open plan. We would definately stay there again.

<Content>Superb Hotel Just to say ignore any bad reviews on this hotel, it was totally superb, the best hotel we'd ever stayed in.The staff couldn't do enough, the breakfast was excellent, the room was perfect, the bath in the room was just incredible.I couldn't fault this hotel at all, not a bit, the interior was very chic, very posh, it made us realise how important a good hotel is!

<Content>Great location - terrible food/beverage service Great location and rooms, very clean and modern. Reception staff helpful but dreadful restaurant/bar staff. 0 stars for service particularly from the male members. Cleaners mopping round restaurant/bar areas at 8pm whilst we were sitting in bar and having drinks! Unbelievable for a 5* hotel.

<Content>Pretty to look at but lacking any form of intelligence. If you have ever wondered what it is like sleeping in your bathroom then save the effort and hassle of falling out with your partner and being kicked out and spend a night or two here. Don't get me wrong it was a very beautiful, artful bathroom/bedroom but a rather strange experince. Trying to put off using 'the bathroom' whilst your loved one was in the room was the challenge for the stay. The shower, very beautiful, but strange to step out of the see through door into the bedroom.Now, maybe the slighly strange bedroom/bathroom just took a bit of getting used to. But the next bit did'nt. The breakfast service was the worst I have ever experinced. The breakfast area was tiny, there were no made up tables (just dirty ones which we had to take off the table clothes ourselves), there was no food there when we arrived twice (actually there was one croissant), no plates..... it was actually embarassing sitting there with other guests all looking bewildered. Nobody seemed to be around, no-one really seem to care, a complete farce for a so called 5 star hotel. Breakfast is something you should look forward to... no dread. So, apart from the worst breakfast experince ever (2 times), bizarre rooms the pros were ----- excellent location and beautiful decor. It was like going out with a super model for a couple of days then realising it would completely do your head in.

<Content>Good as new My wife and I stayed at BCN Design hotel several days after it opened. Every day somebody was knocking on our door asking Is this room OK?Well, except for the smell of glue at the corridor, it was lovely. Modernly decorated, a great shower and a good Wi Fi Internet connection all in a clean white surroundings.We haven';t used the gym on the roof of the hotel, nor the breakfast buffet (though both looked inviting).The hotel is located at the heart of Passeo de Gracia, near to the Rambla from one side and Gaudi's buildings on the other, it is one of the nicest streets in Barcelona.Don't forget to check the incredible tapas restaurants 5 minutes walk from the hotel - Ciudad Condal  Cerveceria Catalana. Both are crowded and lively, Transportation is also a plus, as there is a subway station 50 meters from the hotel's entrance. All in all it was a great choice for our 3 busy days in Barcelona.

<Content>Great Experience at BCN Design I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant to stay at a new hotel especially one with only one not so positive review. However, I found a great rate and decided to book. The stay was excellent, room very clean and comfortable. There were a few issues that came up but this is to be expected since the hotel just opened. Our shower did not work properly when we arrived and we received a new and bigger room. In the new room the A/C leaked, but as soon as we mentioned it, it was fixed. Besides these two issues that were resolved quickly we had a great stay. The location is also extremely convenient. You can take the train directly from the airport to the stop right near the hotel. I would recommend staying in the room with the king size bed. The room we intially received was a double (2 single beds pushed together) and was quite small without a view. Felt quite claustrophobic. This was a great hotel to stay in as a couple- but it could be uncomfortable if traveling with friends or with family. The bathrooms are very open and there is no privacy- as soon as you step out of the shower you are in the room.

<Content>Wish i can review it but i cant! I booked 5 nights in BCN design from 23 May 2008 and to both my wife and my horror, the hotel is not even ready!We have just arrived on 23rd, dogged tired after the usually ultra-reliable SIA flight has a 4-5 hrs delay due to plane fault, resulting in a 20hr flight for us from Singapore to Barcelona.We were hoping to take advantage of the hotel's excellent location (2 mins away from Metro, Gaudi's Casa Battlo and Loewe botique) so that we can maximise our time in Barcelona.What really pisses me off is that the hotel is still taking reservations and did not notify us at all until we arrived at the doorsteps as we are still able to view and book the hotel on 22 May as we tried to book another night at the hotel (which we luckily selected Casanova Hotel by Rafael Hoteles). I think this is very unprofessional on the Eurostar group of hotels to treat their guests this way.The only redeeming factor would be the rather friendly staff, Alvaro, who helped us arranged for alternative accomodation at Gran Marina Eurostars, a fellow Eurostars hotel and arranged for a cab to send us there.We were told that it's a 5 star hotel (which we think is overrated as it's out of the way-abt 15mins way from nearest metro) and we would be upgraded (i doubt we were upgraded as we were given a double room, not a suite). Ended up, we spent at least an hour a day just to walk to/from the metro and really tires us out for the rest of the trip.I will not book any hotels with Eurostars after this experience and sincerely hope that they will change the way they treat the guests.
