<Content>Feeling hot, hot, hot!! We stayed at this hotel for two nights as part of an Archer's tour of Eastern European Cities. On arriving at the hotel it was obvious that it had been converted from a block of flats but was not necessarily unattractive. The rooms were adequately decorated, the only problem being that it was 35 degrees outside and there was no air conditioning at all making it very uncomforable to sleep. It was too noisy to leave the windows open and in any case no air was getting through. The breakfast was ok mainly typical continental. The bar was very nice with pleasant, friendly staff. There is a Lidl supermarket directly opposite the hotel and this may come in handy if you aren't very mobile or keen on walking as there aren't many bars or restaurants in the surrounding area. There is a U-Bahn station approximately a mile away which has a direct line to Alexanderplatz where there are many bars and restaurants (Escados Steakhouse being our favourite!). Overall it is manageable for two nights but can leave you feeling tired due to a lack of sleep and a lot of walking.

<Content>The Communist Lifestyle All Over Again You will definitely feel that you are in East Germany when you venture to this property. It is so far from anything that it detracts from any positives the property may have. It took a 5 minute cab ride (6 Euros) just to get to the Metro/S-Bahn. On top of that it takes a good 30 minutes by Metro to get anywhere worthwhile.The hotel was spartan - no alarm clock, no coffee, not even washcloths. The staff was pleasant enough and they did try to accommodate needs.There was a bar in the lobby that was dingy and LOUD on a Saturday night when all the Poles, Italians and Dutch would kariocke to their hearts content.Overall, this hotel is just not worth it.

<Content>Christmas in Berlin 2006 I disagree with the previous writers. Rooms were clean and comfortable, well up to standard, at least they had two chairs to sit on. Food was excellent although it was a buffet service, this being constantly replenished. Waiter staff was also excellent with dishes being constantly cleared away. The only draw back I could see was it's distance from the Ubahn, though trams and buses were available nearby.

<Content>Ok but wouldn't choose it again I stayed at the Globus with a coach tour. It was obviously a converted East German apartment block but the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the restaurant and bar were fine. But it is definitely not suitable for the independent traveller as it seemed a long way from the centre of the city, in the middle of a residential/industrial area, and is not near any U-bahn station

<Content>Hot, basic and in the middle of nowhere I had the misfortune to room here during the World Cup, as all city centre hotels had been booked out, and we had to pay 275 Euros a night to stay here. It is a about 5 kilometres from the Mitte of Berlin, but is located in the middle of a former Eastern Bloc housing estate and industrial area. The rooms were spartan, but clean, but facilities were poor. Despite outside temperatures in excess of 35 degrees celcius there was no air conditioning, nor even a fan. The room was very noisy and smelt of smoke, despite being a non smoking room. The pillows and duvet seemed to be made of a man-made polyester style material making for a very sweaty and unpleasant sleeping experience.

<Content>Tourist class transit camp I had the professional misfortune to stay at this hotel three times in 2002 while working as a driver guide for a british touring holiday company. The rooms are fine, if a little unexciting. The bar is okay but as you would expect, quite expensive. For those guests who wish to use Berlins extensive U  S Bahn network, you have to take a fifteen minute walk to the nearest U Bahn station. MEALS in this hotel are a DISASTER ZONE. What starts as a well stocked buffet is quickly cleared by the first group of guests and because the buffet is too small, the staff can never keep up with demand. The food quality is also questionable at times, menus are also often repeated from night to night. My advice is to eat out, its far better than joining the hotel bun fight every morning and evening.
