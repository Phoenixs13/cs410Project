<Content>loved the stay bridge Let me just say 鈥渨ow鈥? I never expected for small hotel to go above and beyond like this Staybridge! I normally book at 4 star hotels, but I was trying to conserve funds and thought I would try this out. The staff was so friendly and man behind the front desk was very impressive. The room was very spacious and the full kitchen was a nice touch. The bed was very comfortable, I asked and was told it was a Serta pillowtop mattress, and they were new. The breakfast was good- I had scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast and was only expecting muffins(which they also had.) Crazy to think I have been spending my money on high end hotels and I am missing out and could have been saving money on all my trips to Dallas. They also have a happy hour, which I was not able to use, but hopefully will return in the future and see what this is all about. I would recommend this hotel to everyone traveling to the area. The service was fabulous, rooms were nice and clean, and the breakfast was good.

<Content>nice My teenage daughter and I stayed for 4 nights at this well located hotel. We stayed before at Staybridge suites in Houston and San Antonio and this was very similar. It's very nice to have breakfast in the morning and to be able to take it to your room. This particular hotel does not have a table or similar to sit down and eat, we have to do it at the sofa with the coffee tables, which was a little bit uncomfortable. We experienced some troubles with our door lock but were immediately transfered to another room which was fine, and the staff was very very courteous and helpful. Close by is a Walmart so you can fill your fridge and prepare dinner. We definitely stay again in any Staybridge.

<Content>Great for the price Its a half step up from ameristay. I give it 2.5 star max because it had a pretty good breakfast. The site is misleading because they dont have flat screen tv. Spa is outdoors. The gym consists of a few treadmills. I paid in the $40s for it before tax on priceline.

<Content>Great Value and very safe I love the Staybridge Suites brand its like staying in an apartment but someone else takes care of everything. This property lives up to the brand. Clean, free internet and a decent breakfast to kick off the day. I needed to evacuate 4 team members during Huricane Ike this is the place that I booked them. They were also quite happy with it.

<Content>Absolutely fine Stayed here for four days last week to go to the State Fair and visit other attractions in the area.Check in staff were chatty and helpful. The public areas are nice, although the breakfast seating area seemed small it appeared to accomodate everyone so no issues there. The breakfast was adequate and the sundowner reception was a nice touch also.The fitness room, laundry room and outdoor pool area were all perfectly adequate and not terribly busy.The room was fine, not sure the layout works particularly well though- the 2 queen beds in our room were too much of a squeeze in the given area meaning they were pushed against walls and the location of the TV makes it very difficult to view it from either bed. Having 2 sinks is a welcome aspect though. No reflection on the hotel but an observation - I'm really unsure about the area though, we were returning to the hotel last Thursday evening around 9.30pm when we were approached by a man in the hotel car park asking for money. I have no idea where he appeared from as we hadn't driven by him on our approach. Given that on a previous stay in Addison (Summerfield Suites nearby) I was followed through the carpark and had to make an unscheduled visit to reception I don't feel particularly safe in this area.

<Content>Great stay! I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't check out any of the amenities. The wireless internet access was marginal and the TV was too. But it was a large suite with easy access and close to my customer. Everthing I needed and 3x more space than a regular hotel room.

<Content>Great Experience !!! Comfort, service and value for money!!! I've recently spent a number of weeks staying at this hotel, on my transitional move to the USA. We stayed in the largest suite, and was fortunate to be at the end of the last building, it was almost like a home from home. My husband and I stayed there for 2-3 weeks at a time on 3 occasions, while we transitioned.The hotel is very clean and has everything you need, the rooms are fully equipped with tv (with cable) fridge freezer (with ice maker) microwave, hob and a full range of crockery and utensils. The larger suites have separate bedrooms to the living areas which is great if one of you wants to go to bed and the other wants to stay up watching movies.Everything is very local, there is a petrol station over the road, that sells all of your basics, incl Subway! 2 bar and grills in the same area. Walmart is a short drive (10 minute walk up the road), and there is a fab all you can eat chinese buffet on the way for $7.95 per head.the hotel provides a complimentary continental breakfast, which although small is more than adequate, you have a selelction of muffins, bagels, egg/sausage (needs to be warmed in microwave) fresh fruit and pastries, coffee is available in receiption 24 hours a day.The hotel has its own laundry (great for those longer stays), small gym (basic equipment), and a pool and spa (great for the Texas Summer).We were so impressed by this hotel that we have made this our corporate hotel (our office is just across the car park), and have recently had directors and managers staying there, and they have been more than happy with the service.The staff are friendly and very helpfull, even when you get a few problems (which inevitably you will if you stay there as long as we did). The building is secure, with key card access to get in the main building, and then into the rooms.The hotel will be undergoing a refurbishment shortly, and I'm sure this will just enhance an already great establishment.

<Content>Car broken into and nobody cares My car was broken into and I had some things stolen. I know I shouldn't leave things in my car, and yes there were signs posted but sometimes people forget after a long day. When speaking with the police I learned that this was NOT the first time this had happend. The officer dusting for fingerprints said to me, yeah, this definitly isn't the first time I've seen this parking lot. The signs posted tell you not to leave valuables in your car but all this does is waive any liability and tell criminals that there aren't any security cameras. After multiple break ins, I would expect the hotel to take care of their customers, but the staff was pretty apathetic about the situation.

<Content>Not the best or worst We had a unusual stay at the Bradford Home Suites. I have always had a great experience at the location in Katy, TX. But I was not to impressed with this one in Addison, Tx. The living room area was freezing and the bedroom was hot. The television in the bedroom worked, but the one in the living area only p/u a few channels. Also if you changed the channel you changed both TV's. We checked in late Saturday and called to explain about the tv and they said someone could fix it Monday. That is when we were checking out. Just would not recommend this place to a close friend. The location was great for where we were going. But just not the norm for the Bradford. There were many other nice hotels nearby. I think if we were to go back we would find another hotel.

<Content>Overcharged Cancelled our reservation, they were booked full, and charged me anyway with the excuse they were full. Would not give me consideration or credit.

<Content>Loved the Bradford This hotel is well worth the $$$. The free breakfast in the morning was great, the room was clean, the staff was nice, and the location was good. Me and my family enjoyed our staff very much. This is a great hotel if you have children, if you are staying more than two nights, in town on business, or an older couple. I would stay again in a minute.

<Content>Great value I was there for a conference at the convention center. The suite was comfortable and clean. The staff was courteous, especially the shuttle driver. I stayed there for $80.00 per night , which was far less than any other downtown hotel. The only thing wrong was the lack of restaurants nearby.

<Content>Tripadvisor from Austin This was a great hotel in a great location. Not only is it clean and nice looking, it was also only a walk away from watching the Mavericks play at the American Airlines stadium. I'd definitely book at this hotel again when visiting Dallas.
