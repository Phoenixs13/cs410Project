<Content>Overall satisfied We found the hotel extremely convenient as it is just a few meters from the Ramblas.Our room overlooked the road, just above the entrance, but was still quiet. It was large and the bathroom was modern. Every thing was clean.The entrance was rather basic and receptionist was helpful.Breakfast was not exceptional, but good enough.

<Content>Cheap and friendly For the low price and great location, it was so much better than what I expected. The staff were polite and helpful, the room was small but clean and secure. No view from window though. And don't go to the pub opposite unless you want to go to an English pub. Hotel is right next to a cash point, and 10 meters from La Rambla.

<Content>Ruined one full day of our short break We are a married couple who travel quite regularly and book through hotel websites everytime. We booked this one on the day we arrived and when we got to the hotel the staff were quite rude. Not thinking anything of it, we proceeded to our room and found they had put us in a twin room. so we went back to reception as we had booked a double room. On explaining that there was an error the 2 men on reception were abusive, rude and trying to tell us that in europe a double room means 2 singles. we asked for a refund and they would not give it to us. we stayed calm and polite through this and just wanted to leave then after much more yelling and insults from the men in both english and spanish we were given another room (110) which was a dark, pokey room in the back of the hotel with a mossy brick wall as the view (the first room they gave us had a balcony) This hotel is cheap and accordingly nasty, the staff are intimidating and rude. As we left they joked in spanish they would use my Credit Card details to buy his wife a gift. (thinking we could not understand) This was a simple mistake they could have rectified in seconds and instead they upset us and ruined our holiday. Dont stay here! other hotels in barcelona for the same price are 10 times better. PS yes, i did cancel my CC.

<Content>Fabulous Location The hotel was in a great location for tourists, just metres off La Rambla. The room was basic, but lovely and clean and although the view from the window was a little poor, it doesn't matter because you're up early in the morning and in again late at night. The breakfast was nice too, really set you up for the day. Moderno is about 10 mins walk either way to the marina and to the centre of the city , everything is very accessible. I would stay there again.

<Content>Not so great Moderno Moderna is located in a very central spot beside the Ramblas. Perhaps a little too central for some people's tastes. It was extremely noisy at night, for the 3 nights I stayed there, I wore ear plugs and was still woken up by the noise outside. The rooms were very basic. We booked a room suitable for 3 persons. However, the seemed to just put an extra bed in a double room, so it was very cramped. We asked for a balcony, but is more like a window-ledge. I have nothing good or bad to say about the staff. They gave a mere nod of their head during our stay there. The breakfast was pretty standard

<Content>A short ramble from La Rambla. Perfectly situated just off La Rambla, Hotel Moderno offers basic but satisfactory accommodation. Be warned though it can be very noisey at night and the area does attract a few less savoury members of society!!Staff are very welcoming and speak good English. Rooms are small clean and well equipped - a kettle would be a nice addition. Breakfast, which is included in the price, is the usual continental affair. Starting service for breakfast at 8am might be a problem for those with an early start to the day. Personally I thought it was expensive for what it was.

<Content>Simple and Inexpensive We originally booked a hotel online, only to arrive and find it was NOT what we had hoped for and at 11 PM started looking for a different hotel. Lucky for us, we found the Moderno. The wonderful older desk clerk was kindness itself, and gave us an unbelievable rate -69Euro per room, per night including breakfast! We had an interior room-no view but oh so quiet! The room was simple and modern, good sized and immaculate, as was the bathroom. The breakfast was a nice Catalan style with meats, cheeses, cereal, fresh fruit, juice and of course breads, rolls and coffee. Just steps from the Ramblas, it was the perfect small hotel. Not a lot of trimmings, but a good value. ONE note of caution - the rooms are Not soundproof, and you can hear a bit of noise from the other travelers as they come and go. But for that rate I can pack ear plugs! I would gladly return.

<Content>Basic as it comes Having never been to Barcelona before I really wanted this short 4 day trip to be unspoiled.However the moderno hotel put an end to that idea. Let me start with its relatively good point. Location is superb. And that鈥檚 it! Right in the heart of the busy Ramblas area you can explore many of Barcelona鈥檚 attractions on foot, as long as you wear a good pair of walking shoes.However the rooms we were allocated were no more than shoeboxes. My friend鈥檚 room was more suitable for a hamster, and his morning view was the inner walls of the hotel itself. More akin to a cheap hostel size or a prison .The bathroom floors were so dirty I had to ask the cleaners to mop it again to remove the hairs all over the floor. The breakfast, although continental is far from adoqute.I was offered more choice in a cheaper hostel in Amsterdam recently. If you鈥檙e a vegetarian then forget it. Its cornflakes or cheese and bread. Once, there was no milk left for coffee, and another morning my half eaten breakfast was swiftly removed from my table as I stood up to get another drink. But by far the worst aspect of this hotel is the noise. I didn鈥檛 get a single good nights sleep whilst there. You hear every footstep and every banging door throughout the night and early next morning. I wish someone on trip advisor had warned readers of this, and I for one would definitely not have stayed. On my last morning they were actually doing work on the next room. The noise was atrocious. And to the end this inaccurately 3starred hotel overcharged for the rooms. I disputed the bill twice pointing out that by email I was assured this was the final amount. This fell on deaf ears and I was advised this is the tax on top. So why tell me otherwise before arrival? All in all, the place is overpriced for what you get, and the service is mediocre at best. The rooms are nothing more than tiny cupboards and the food as bare as it can comes. If you鈥檙e stuck, and there is nowhere else to choose, then maybe worth a look. But confirm in writing the total Inc tax before hand, and ask about the view of the room first. Also, be sure to take ear plugs, you鈥檒l need them.

<Content>Location location location! Location of this hotel is amazing... You literally walk out the door and you're on one of the worlds most amazing streets. Hotel room was large, very clean and comfortable. However the 1st floor room was a bit dark as the window was out into a small area which led up to a skylight. Apart from this, oh and a clearer dropping in at a very early 09.30 (no idea why!!!) when checkout was not til 12.00, this hotel was worth the very good last minute booking! I would definately stay here again!

<Content>Loved our stay at Moderno Hotel Had a wonderful three nights at the Moderno Hotel. Excellent location, excellent staff extremely helpful and the hotel is squeaky clean. We were amazed at the excellent housekeeping. One place where I would walk barefoot and that is saying alot. Would recommend and have already recommended it to friends. Very good experience in Barcelona due to the very patient,helpful staff. Their restaurant next door was also good. Highly recommend both.

<Content>Would definitly recommend! Hotel is situated at the ramblas, most attractions are in walking distance. Large and clean rooms/bath (newly refurbished).Breakfast could be more various, but all in all the hotel is absolutely great value for the money (we paid 250 鈧?for 4 nights).

<Content>12 steps to la rambla My friend and I stayed in the Moderno Hotel 13th and 14th of November and have just got back to the uk to-day. We had a twin room which was on the first floor, very spacious, spotlessly clean and a beautiful spacious and clean bathroom. The breakfast was lovely and all the staff were very helpfull.The hotel itself was literally 12 steps off La Rambla with a nice pub oppisite. We would definately stay here again. It was soo handy when you were out shopping to be able to return to the hotel with your purchases and freshen up to go out again.While there we looked at other hotels in the area but are glad we chose the Moderno as it was by far the best choice for everything.I would give this hotel 10 out of 10.

<Content>Too close for comfort Booked 4 nights on the internet after reading Trip Advisor reviews. Stayed one night and learned that should only book one night until you check a place out since you can have a dispute with management if you decide not to stay. Management was nice enought to let me out of the booking. The hotel had a non-existant lobby and our first comment upon getting into the room was that it was like a prison cell, as small as can possibly be. We had to take turns being on one side of the bed or the other. The bed had no mattress cover and the sheets didn't completely cover the bed so that your hands under the pillow were on the mattress. We we told that we couldn't get a balcony with a double bed so all we had was a window to the noisy street. The only thing modern about it was that it had magnetic card locks and central air conditioning. Bathroom fixtures were good and there was a Bidet and hair dryer. It is centrally located but so are 100 other hotels.

<Content>Great Location Great location just off La Rambla, close to Gothic quarter and just 2 minutes from the metro. Reasonably priced for the location. Bedrooms a little on the small side but very clean. Receptionists very helpful in providing maps, giving directions etc. Would recommend it.

<Content>Excellent value. From the outside this hotel is so nondescript I walked past it. The reception area was not very inspiring and when asked for payment in advance I was rather apprehensive.However the room, bathroom, breakfast room and lounge were all spacious and modern and the location is superb. It was great value for money.

<Content>Visit Barcelona The Moderno hotel is very well located next to the Ramblas, but we sleep on the street side, and due the fact off works on the street in the ramblas, all the circulation was driving in the street of the hotel. It was very difficult to sleep at night. The breakfast was poor, no eggs or milkproducts for example. The same sheets for 3 nights and pieces glass on the ground in the room!The first day the staff (young girl) was friendly, but the other days the receptionist was a little bit nervousand unfriendly.In the description off my reservation the safe was included and when I leave the hotel they asked me 6鈧?for the key! Strange policy!But Barcelona is a fantastic town!

<Content>Moderno - Great location Great location and comfortable rooms. The Ramblas is 30 yards away and almost located right in the centre. The local bar next to the hotel is cheap as a starting point on a night out. Use the room safe, 2 of my friends had their money stolen from their rooms on the 1st night.

<Content>comfortable, great location After a gruelling one night stay at Hotel Principal, we moved to Hotel Moderno at Hospital street, literally a few away from La Rambla. Front desk people were friendly. The rooms were comfortable and and the bathrooms were very clean. The amount we paid was so reasonable for this kind of accommodation - considering all other things such us LOCATION, cleanliness and good service. I've recommended this hotel to several people already.

<Content>Highly Recommended! I would absolutely recommend this hotel! The location is excellent (just off the Rambla, you can walk to the Placa de Catalunya and the Gothic area very easily and you have a metro station, Liceu, just 50 m. from the hotel), the staff is very friendly, the continental breakfast really quite good, and last but not least, the rooms are very clean and we had good comfortable beds, you really can tell it has been renovated recently.

<Content>Great Place to stay in Barcelona Just got back from a stay at the Moderno Hotel in Barcelona. I would highly recommend this hotel. The location is perfect. It is just off the Las Ramblas and walking distance to everything. They told us the hotel was less than a year old. I would believe that as it was evident that all the bathroom fixtures and such appeared quite new. The rooms are a bit sparce. A few pictures on the wall could do wonders. The staff was friendly and spoke english which was helpful. The hotel offers a continental breakfast that was quite nice. In closing, if you are looking for the Hilton this is not your hotel but, if you want a good clean hotel in a great location and reasonable price I could'nt recommend the Hotel Moderno more.
