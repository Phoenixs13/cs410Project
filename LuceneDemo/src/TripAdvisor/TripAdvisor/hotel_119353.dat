<Content>rough around the edges This hotel has the potential to be a nice extended stay hotel, but it currently has things to be desired. As also previously stated, the hotel was completing renovations during my stay (I was told that the first floor was the last to be worked on). As such, the rooms were nice (granite counters, full size fridge, comfortable bed, 2 flat screen TVs), but paint/glue fumes were noticeable in the hallways and rooms. Also, other coworkers and I noticed things that still needed attention in our hotel rooms -- bathroom vent cover missing, noisy ceiling fan, water leak from the ceiling, light fixture not working. Two out of the 5 large exercise equipments in the fitness room also were out of order.The evening reception was nice. Wine and beverages, salad, and hot snacks are available in a serve yourself set-up. The manager even occasionally went around to greet guests and offer to take away used plates and glasses. The breakfast selections, however, while hot, were generally of defrost-heat-n-serve quality. The waffle maker was a hit, but disappointing items included the completely albino hashbrowns and doughy breakfast burritos.Overall, this hotel could be better than it's currently being managed.

<Content>Okay Stay, but beware We stayed for six nights. It's a good property with convenient access to all points in the Valley. Many restaurants nearby, including a Sweet Tomatoes, Lone Star Steakhouse, Fajitas and Outback all within walking distance. Nice park across the street to run. The rate we had was great ($109/night). Now for the not so good. They are doing extensive remodelling so there is a good deal of noise (drilling, hammering, etc.) during the day. Because of this activity, we had continuing visits from water bugs coming through the drains, one in particular was at least four inches long. After killing the invader, I took it to the front desk and the night manager did not offer anything other than It's Arizona...We've got bugs. Needless to say, I made sure that when we went to bed, we stuffed the drains with small hand towels so that we could sleep in peace. Other problems: The outer door card readers hardly ever worked, so you'd end up walking all the way around to the lobby entrance just to get in. The sprinklers burst one night, flooding the patio area and the breakfast left much to be desired. However, once the remodelling is finished, it'd be a great place for the price.

<Content>Disappointed! I have stayed in two other cities: in a Homewood Suite hotel, and I loved those! We arrived at 9pm, at this Phoenix Homewood Suite, due to flight delays. There was one bed left. It was a room close to highway traffic.We walked into the room. It was supposed to be a suite, it was a 15x15 box, with a wall down the middle to make it a suite. The fire alarm was torn off the wall. The artificial plants had at least 4 years of dust on them. The ethernet would not work. The phone cord fell out of the wall, when we tried to put the phone near where we were sitting. The computer tech called once, we got disconnected...and although we called the front desk at least 3 more times about this connection problem: the computer tech never returned our calls.The bedding and kitchen were clean (except for the plants), but every door in the suite: hit a dresser or a table. The decor was very outdated and dark. (not like the pictures on the website). The halls were dark and somewhat spookey. We stayed 1 night (we were booked for 3), and we left for a better Hilton hotel in another part of the city.We were very disappointed! I will be much more reluctant to book Homewood Suites from now on. Don't assume that the pictures on the internet are what you will get!

<Content>Clean  This hotel is nice and clean. The staff was nice. I was able to print my airline boarding pass at the front desk. They serve a pretty decent breakfast. Waffles, fruit, eggs (not sure how fresh), yogurt, sausage, oj (not fresh), coffee, etc. The rooms are large, with a living room, kitchenette, even a dishwasher. The beds were comfy and there were a ton of different pillows, 5 on each bed and even more in the closet!! Also, it is within walking distance (less than a 5 min walk) to a couple of chain restaurants. Not flashy or anything but would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Good Stay for this NIce Hotel This hotel is located right off Interstate 17.Not hard to find off the highway.We were originally booked in a 1 bedroom 2 double beds suite but, we got upgraded because there was a 2 bedroom with a king available.The pool and sport court area (basketball available) are open from 8am-10pm each night.Water was very warm and comfortable. The tempature outside was 109 and the water was about 95 but was very comfortable.The suite shop was very nice and had the items that i liked.The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly.They have a nice lobby area to watch tv and have the breakfast and managers reception.The hotel is about 20 mins from Phoenix airport and 10 mins from Deer Valley Airport.There are a number of hotels within 5 minutes of the hotel and there is ample parking for your car (free of charge)Good hotel and nice room.

<Content>mixed Stayed for 10 nights with my 17 month old son and husband. The staff was friendly and welcoming and the rooms were okay - decently comfortable and clean.However, there was inadequate work space (surprising for a hotel designed for business travelers) and not enough drawer space. But, the breakfast was atrocious. Same thing, day after day, and what was served truly terrible tasting.

<Content>A very pleasant place to stay Weare in the second day of a two day stay, and we think this is a lovely property. The suites are large, clean, and nicely furnished. The free evening meal last night consisted of two good soups and fresh salad fixings. Breakfast today included bacon and sausage, eggs, bagels and other rolls, canned peaches, yogurt, cereals, etc, and we thought it was very good.The only negative is the very loud A/C. We shut it off finally late last night and opened windows. For that reason, I probably would not stay here in summer. However, any other season, I would look forward to returning.

<Content>Good value for the money BUT...... This was our second time staying at this hotel, a week each time. The staff at this hotel is consistently great. Very friendly, polite, and anxious to please. The rooms could do with some updating. Our couch was very dirty and had stains. More light in the vanity area would be good. The bed is great. Our air conditioning quit working our 3rd day and it took until 7 pm to get someone up to fix it. They said we had froze it because we set the temp at 70 degrees - it was 99 outside and our room got the full blast of the sun. The free breakfast and manager's reception have gone downhill since last year. Every morning was the round re-heated eggs and sausage, one time cold french toast was in a basket on the side of the toaster ( but the toaster was broken on one side), bread and bagels, cereal, plus canned fruit cocktail. No yogurt this time, no variety. They ran out of styro cups and napkins. Last year the breakfast varied with bacon, pancakes, french toast in the steamer some days. The evening reception was hot dogs and canned baked beans once, canned ravioli once, mac and cheese next time. Last year was chicken wings, taco salad, etc. They did have lettuce, peppers, and broccoli out for salad bar each night. The beer dispenser was broken every day while we were there but wine was available, as were bottled sodas. The biggest complaint we have - and why we will not go back - is because of the noise of the air conditioner. It's a wall unit from floor to ceiling in the bedroom and is so loud it makes it difficult to sleep. We really like the hotel for the value and convenience but just can't over-come this noise at night. However, we would still recommend this hotel for families and anyone who is going to be in the area for an extended time that doesn't have a problem with the air conditioning noise. The kitchen is a big plus and there is a Fry's Market very close. The location is great for baseball spring training parks.

<Content>Great place to stay!!! This was a great hotel to stay at!! Our room faced the pool, which was wonderful. The rooms were really clean and the staff was helpful and knowledgeable. They had a breakfast everyday and a managers reception on the week days. The only suggestion I would have would be to get there early, because the food goes fast. The drinks during the managers recpetion were plentiful! The hotel was right off of I-17 so getting anywhere was a breeze. I would def. stay here again, it was a wonderful experience. The room was very big and the kitchen was AMAZING. Great room, and a great value. I would highly recommend it.

<Content>OK place, not as nice as other Homewood Suites This is the fourth different Homewood Suites I have stayed at, but unfortunately, is the first one to be somewhat disappointing. While it is still a good hotel with the amenities to make a business trip go smoothly, it lacks the attention to details in other Homewood suites I have accustomed to. Breakfast was weak with little variation. My room was showing its age, with stains in the tub and tired furniture. It was also facing I-17, so noise was a factor. I can also see that some of the rooms are very close (within several feet) of a giant billboard that is lit up at night.On the good side, the staff is friendly and helpful. There are several machines in the fitness room that actually work.Overall, it is OK for the value. If possible, ask for rooms that face the inside (not the freeway or Peoria Ave side).

<Content>Great Home Away From Home My family stayed her for over a week for the Junior Olympics baseball tournament. We were very pleased with the accommodations, which consisted of a large bedroom with king bed, TV, iron and ironing board, and 2 closets; a large bathroom; and a living area with sofa sleeper, recliner, TV, VCR, and fully-equipped kitchen with electric burners, microwave, dishwasher, coffeemaker, full-size fridge, and breakfast bar. The entire suite was very clean and comfortable. The A/C was making a loud noise when we arrived, but they promptly took care of it. Breakfast was very good and varied by the day, including cheese omelettes, egg disks, bacon, sausage, waffles, fruit, muffins, etc. Most surprising was the Manager's Reception from 5-7 p.m. Mon-Thurs., which really consisted of a full meal plus sodas, wine, and beer. Day 1 featured hot wings, BBQ sandwiches and a large salad bar. Day 2 featured turkey tetrazzini, salisbury steaks, and salad bar; Day 3 featured mac-n-cheese, a macaroni and ground beef casserole, and salad bar; and Day 4 featured high-quality hot dogs, potato salad, macaroni salad, etc. The reception meals, while not gourmet, were pretty good and saved our family a bundle.

<Content>ok, but not overly impressed We stayed one night in this hotel. We asked for early check-in in advance, but when we arrived, it was not available - we wasted a couple of hours in the nearby mall, waiting for a room to be ready,although hotel was not full. Pool was small, but adequate. Rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Refrigerator made a bit of a racket. I was unable to find an icemaker anywhere on site - not enough time for freezer in room to make ice.A track team happened to be occupying the hotel at the same time - while chaperones were with the 10-15 yr olds (approx age) the younger siblings were allowed to run up and down the hallways yelling a screaming until well into the night. Management did nothing to quiet the noise.The business center was unattainable as well, as the chaperones gave the room key cards required to the kids who took turns pretty steadily.Breakfast was average - frozen waffles, eggs, sausage, juice, toast. Seating was more than ample. Area was clean and inviting.

<Content>Short Stay, Family of 5 We stayed Feb. 17 - Feb. 20, our family of 5 (kids 1, 5,  7) and my sister's family of 3 (one 5-yr. old). The rooms were great for us. Loved having full kitchen and sofa bed. Her room was on the highway side and was much bigger; ours was on the pool/sport court side. There was some noise from outside, but never too late and was always drowned out by the a/c.I was really impressed by the noise abatement between rooms. We were next door to a group of 4 teenage boys (there for a soccer tourney) and we never heard them except in the hallway.Breakfast was served every day and was mediocre at best, but good enough for us: cereal, bagels or danish, egg frisbees (warmed from frozen, I guess!), yogurt, toast (even had little pots of p'nut butter). We didn't stay for the dinners, but the one my sister had was disappointing - hot dogs and hamburgers on barbeque night. Oh, well - we didn't stay for the food.The staff was very pleasant and totally accomodating. We had requested a crib that was not in our room when we checked in - I called and it arrived right away. HOusekeeping came each day unless your privacy card was on the door. After 2 days w/the card out, they stuck a note under the door just to check in on us!The pool was adequate in size, but very poorly maintained. On our second day, they closed it to shock it, but the next day the water was so cloudy you couldn't see the second step. Don't know what was happening - again, we didn't stay for the pool, so didn't really affect us.The location was very close to lots of good restaurants, shopping and Castles 'n Coasters (small amusement park). Also across from a very large outdoor sports complex which had a HUGE open dog park, play structure, soccer/ball fields.In all, our stay was better than expected. I think I have learned not to expect much, though, so might be a little disappointing to the well-traveled!

<Content>I thought it was another Embassy Suites, but... Looking for prices and a free breakfast, I saw the Homewood Suites and read in other review sites that there was a free breakfast here. I got a Internet special price and called because I was in late (11pm). Checkin was fine and the staff attentive at that time. The premises was clean and a newer facility. The suite was fine with a kitchen, fridge pots and plates and two seat nook area. The room was large with a very quiet ceiling fan. The AC was loud. The breakfast was a fraud. I called and specifically asked if they had bacon, eggs and potatoes. The person said they have eggs and sausage, but no potatoes. Well, it was a continential breakfast with some steam tray of precooked scrambled egg patties and sausage. There was the other juices, bagels and breads, but the hot foods was out of a steam tray. I had breakfast the next day at a breakfast spot the next morning. Overall, nice spot except for the fraud breakfast.

<Content>Just Like Coming Home! We had the opportunity to stay at a Homewood Suites when we drove up to Phoenix from Tucson for an Arizona Diamondbacks Game. I found the Homewood Suites online and booked it for the weekend. To our amazement, we were so pleasantly suprised. The rooms are beautiful, the breakfast was great and the excercise room was just what we were looking for. The staff was friendly and for the price, it feels like you're at home. We felt we could stay there a month. Outstanding accommodations!
