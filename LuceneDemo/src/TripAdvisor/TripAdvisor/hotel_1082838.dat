<Content>Under Construction Be careful. I arrived to find this hotel was under major renovation. Instead of closing this virtual building site, the hotel remains open with a small note in the elevator stating noise and vibration will occur from 11 am to 6 pm. Quite unbearable after an 18 hour flight. Shocked to find the construction began at 9 am the next morning! No breakfast room because that too was under renovation, but the relatively cheap price excuses that. The only redeeming thing is that the beds are comfortable, the rooms of fairly good size (for central Tokyo) and the location is in a quiet side street of Ginza. I highly recommend you contact the hotel directly to find out about the state of renovation before booking, unless you don't mind pneumatic drilling over your head.
