<Content>Nicely central For a night in Amsterdam, we dediced we wanted a cheapish hotel in the centre. After an internet search we found this hotel. We checked in, and got told that we were allowed to bring 'guests' back to the room. Kind of strange, but he ho, we are in Amsterdam. The room was very basic, and not very big. The bathroom was oke, could be better maintained. We went out in Amsterdam for the evening, and the hotel is prefectly located for this. After a basic night sleep, we had breakfast, which actually is better than the room, basic but sufficient.Checking out went without problems, all in all value for money.

<Content>Avoid this hotel Guys, I'm Dutch and know Dutch/Amsterdam standard hotels/prices... This hotel (at least the room they gave us) was way below standard. The room was right on the stairway in front of the lift, very noisy.. we're not offended by noise though but would bother the noise-sensitives. The room was dirty, damp, white TL lights, very small, beds overused, soft and uncomfartable, bed linen very dirty, full of stains and holes and stinking (we slept with our clothes on, on a july night just to avoid skin contact with the bed linen), bathroom out-of-date from the 80's standard white tile walls and the most annoying was the day after, all the itch and bite spots from the bugs... Paid 90 Euros per night per room, and believe me, there are much much better places to stay even cheaper.. The room size is small, but if that was the only problem i wouldn't mind at all... PS: We booked for two nights but left after the first night simply because we couldn't stay there any minute longer, had no refunds, and booked another hotel for the second night, very close, cleaner and even a few euros cheaper.... I would never ever ever go back and i'd think twice if i were you before booking here...

<Content>hated the hotel cordial The staff at the front desk were pleasent and helpful.The room was old, outdate carpet, bed, bedspread and filthy.The place was terribly noisy and sort of scary. Did not feel safe at all. The shower had no shower stall or curtain. The water just runs directly onto the tile floor with a drain!!! Very convenient to stand under the shower head and pee directly into the toilet next to you.My wife cried when she saw the room and refused to get undressed and slept on the bed in her clothes. We desided to get up at 5 AM so we could get out of this overpriced dump ($200) ASAP.The only bright spot was the very helpful front desk folks.

<Content>Just Perfect just perfect, i've spent in this hotel 4 nights and it couldn't have been better, at the beginning i wasn't sure about my decision but then again i just needed a clean, small room to spend a few days in the last free city of planet earth, i wasn't with family or girlfriend so i did not have much to risk. During these 4 days i had the chance to meet the guys who run the place, and they were all very friendly and easygoing, expecially Mario, a great guy who was always willing to help. The rooms are small, no doubt about it, but i can assure that they're clean and confortable, i even had a small plasma tv with cable channell, and considering that it's a budget hotel, i'd say it's incredible.I had a room in the back side of the building so the view from the room was very poor (and i've been told that from Mario when i arrived, so he's been honest) but i could sleep peacefully like a baby without noise; there are also room on the front side, and they have a great view on one of the main strip, but ovviously could be noisy...Never had breakfast so i don't really know, but nobody was complaining about it so i guess it was good.The hotel is 10min walking to anywhere so i never had to take a taxi and that helped a lot since taxi are incredible expensive in Amsterdam.To make a lontg story short, this is the best budget hotel i've ever been to and i would definately suggest it to every easygoing, well-natured person who wants to live Amsterdam as a friend of the city and not as a snob tourist.Thanks to Mario and to the staff

<Content>Great location, very friendly staff, basic hotel We stayed in the Cordial this weekend (sat/sun). Good value for money in one of the best central location in Amsterdam.Hotel is dated but everthing was in working order. Our shower hose broke and was replaced by staff in 5 min flat. If you are looking for cheap and cheerful this is the place to explore Amsterdam. Looking for big rooms ect. try the hilton. Oh and not a bug in sight...We used Smart Parking for two night for 50EUR. They pick up your car at checkin and deliver at check out. No hassel with bags.

<Content>sooo much noise!!!!!!! on arrival at the hotel we had the feeling that it was going to be rather nice, the front office is all decorated in marble stone and the reception staff were initially very helpful and friendly.... needless to say this didn't last!!!!when we got to our room we found it to be slightly dated and in need of work considering we had a MASSIVE damp patch on one of our walls, when we opened our windows we found there were extensive roadworks going on outside the hoel day and night these were loud and made sleeping a difficulty....lets talk about the breakfast.... very basic and not particularly tasty or enjoyable as we found most days we were going to get something else to eat before lunch time.whats worse... on our last night having been out for a meal arrived back at our hotel to find the front door locked, on looking inside we found there was nobody going about, decided to ring the door bell to try and grab somones attention was a waste on time and we had no other option but to wait over 30 minutes until the casually dressed security guard had been downstairs doing his laundry!!!!!!!

<Content>Great hotel!!! A friend and I were looking at the reviews on Hotel Rokin and as I'm quite the girly girl and will not tolerate bugs I was very dubious about booking after the reviews. I was told however by my male companion to just suck it up as it was getting quite late for booking and I was lucky he wasn't making me stay in a hostel with 20 people to a room!!! So we booked it and on arrival was just in shock at how nice the place is!! Coffee and minerals machine in the reception and big couches as part of the bar! Straight away we were given our key by a lovely receptionist and got such a nice welcome. Sure the room was small but it was warm (it was snowing when we were there!), had 2 single intact beds with crisp white sheets and clean pillows (the throw was a bit shabby but you wouldn't need it as it's warm in the rooms), a spotless bathroom with the usual soaps and shampoos etc in it! Only complaint I had was that there was no key to our safety deposit bow but it was no hassle to have the passports in a handbag as that's all we were planning on using it for!You could come and go 24 hrs as long as you left your key with reception. Nothing was ever taken from our luggage which included iPods, cameras, memory cards!Breakfast was your usual continental with everything as fresh and tasty as you liked and no complaints there! We didn't take advantage of the bar so can't say much about that!Overall the hotel is great and more you can ask for given the price is reasonable! If you're looking for spacy bedrooms however go elsewhere! Rooms are cosy but with plenty of space to move around and store your luggage!! Besides what else do you use a hotel room for except sleeping, showering and changing?! No problems with noise, bugs, leaks, mould or anything else!! I have it booked again for my next trip in the summer!! Totally central to everything and very easy to find!!Book this hotel as long as you're not in need of a massive room!!

<Content>Not acceptable. The worst hotel i have ever stayed in. The reception was rude and swore many times at us in casual conversation. There were pubic hairs on our bathroom floor and a used condom outside out window. There were holes in the bed covers and the lighting was incredibly bad. At night it was incredibly hard to sleep with the loud noises coming from other rooms and very bad smoke smells coming from the corridoors. It was just not acceptable.

<Content>cordial cool we have just returned from amsterdam the hotel is on the main road but our room was at the back so we never heard any noise but i dont think it would be a problem anyway.when we arrived at the hotel the reception was very good we was greeted by mario who is very pleasant and helpful,we could not check in till 1pm but we were able to leave are bags and have a wounder round.we booked a classic triple room which was basic but ok you have a telly and shower which was cleaned daily,you have a lift to your room if you dont want to use the lift the stairs arnt that bad no kettle in room but you can get a cup of coffee in reception for 1euro overall good value and easy walking distance to everywhere.

<Content>Not the best! 2008 Hotel Cordia,Reception staff were rude and very unhelpful kept sending us in the wrong direction. When we rang down to complain about a strange man sleepin in the hall way it took them nearly an hour to move him. Turned out he wasnt from the hotel and they had to call the police. It is a smoking hotel and the bed sheets had fag burns in them, the girl who came with me got bite marks all over her from what we can only assume are bed bugs. The rooms were exceptionally small! on the plus side beds were always straightened. Location was excellent and we were able to get about really easliy. The noise at night was really bad hardly got any sleep becausue of the trams and doors slamming. Overall if you like ruffing it and dont mind noise, rude staff and awful breakfast which comprised of cheese sandwidges and ham then go there! the location is awsome but that is all.

<Content>Cannot fault it!!! I was dreading going to this hotel after the reviews that I had read on Tripadvisor. I must say that I do not agree with any of the previous reviews. I was staying at this hotel in a group of 7 girls and must say that I have no major faults with the hotel. The rooms were adequate with good working showers, the staff were extremely friendly, the maids were very keen to clean the rooms and the location is ideal for getting around the city. The only complaint that I can say is that we were upset that the bar was not open (due to refurbishments!). Breakfast was contintental but fine, worth going to though as you see people stealing bread rolls for later!! And best of all none of us came back with bed bug bites!!!! An all round success I would say.

<Content>Can't see what everyone is complaining about! Well, after booking this hotel, I had a look on tripadvisor.com to see how other people had rated their experiences at this hotel.  What insued was a mad frenzy of paranoia about bedbugs and fear that I had booked a horrible hotel.  Upon arrival I was encouraged by the friendly staff, who didn't fail to impress once, even at 3am when we arrived back at reception enquiring about how to get to the Amsterdam Arena for our following days outing, the staff were friendly and helpful even drawing us a map.  The rooms were quite small and yes the decor was slightly old fashioned but I was impressed with the modern and spotlessly clean bathrooms. None of the rooms had bed bugs, we had three rooms and 10 beds, not one had bed bugs, believe me, I checked thoroughly having watched countless videos and tutorials on how to spot them.  Breakfast was basic, but for the price of the hotel we hadn't exactly been expecting a sumptuous feast. The location was good, the shops on one side, ten minutes from the main clubbing and bar area and of course the infamous red light district on the other side, which is a must see for anyone. All in all, we had a great trip, with the hotel being an excellent HQ for us, I would recommend this hotel to any groups of 18-25 year olds who want a good location, comfortable beds and somewhere to wash. If you are looking for luxury then perhaps this hotel is not for you but anyone with any sense would instantly recognise that due to the price of staying here.

<Content>Revolting Unfortunately I booked this dump for a party of five people before, I read the poor reviews on tripadvisor. This the the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. We booked one single room and two twin rooms and all of them were awful. The blanket covers on the beds were dirty, old and tattered. The curtains were filthy ( I was afraid to touch them ). The carpets were dirty. The beds were literally alive with fleas or bugs, as some of our group members were bitten several times. They were also so narrow that if you turned once in the bed, you would fall on the floor. I removed one of the pillow covers, to reveal a filthy yellow pillow. It looked like it had'nt been changed for years. The lift was old and slow. The staff at reception were rude and ignorant and really could'nt care less about any residents. In my honest opinion, this hotel is a health hazard. DO NOT STAY IN HOTEL CORDIAL.

<Content>Not keen on sharing! The hotel does just what it says on the tin! It was clean, right on the main route into town, and easy to get anywhere however, I and all the rest of our group of 12 came home with more BUG bites than can be counted on all our collective fingers!I had 28 bites, my room mate 15!I dont believe this hotel can be like all the time, oh and there are huge road works going on outside with the mother of all jack hammers rattling away from 7am till . . . . We got back to the hotel at 6.30am and so didn't get much sleep but we weren't ther to sleep!!All in all it was OK, but dont take your wife for a romantic weekend! Good bar over the road does breakfast, great wet room!

<Content>Did The Job. This hotel is very basic as you can tell from the 1 star rating. It is a good place to sleep and shower. The staff  food were ok and the room was cleaned everyday. The room was very small but as I said it was only a place to rest my head and for the money it was better than staying in a hostel :-) If you just want somewhere to crash then this is the place if your looking for luxury maybe you should be prepared to part with more of your cash!

<Content>hotel is good if you get a big room overlooking courtyard we went in august with a 2 couples and when we first arrived we were given 2 double rooms.while one of the rooms was very good, the other was tiny!! i mean the only thing in the room was a double bed (there was no room for anything else! as we were staying a few days and had a lot of stuff, we asked for a room change, 2 rooms later and we got a very nice room overlooking the courtyard.this hotel was great, very central, clean, great staff ( i even forgot my purse one day with around 400 euros in it, and the maid handed it into reception.the only downside was the works going outside, but this did not disrupt us too much as our rooms didn't face the road.the so called 24hour bar was funny though, its just a vending machine that sells beer :-)i would recomend this hotel as it cheap and clean and the staff are very helpful.

<Content>Avoid at all costs Just got back home (27th April 2007) after worst stay anywhere of my entire life. V unfriendly man at reception had a habit of making you wait whilst he was playing on computer - for crying out loud how difficult is it to get your room key!! The management who were chinese also did not offer any kind words and instead ignored guests.The room, or more like box was disgusting, dried blood on sink, I even squashed a few fleas, bed cover looked at least 30 years old, bed uneven, shower in toilet, constant smell of dope, poorly lit - seriously the list is endless.My room was also single glazed and with the major piling works (building new subway) going on right outside and recobbling of path - which was going on during the night I might add - this just added insult to injury. If I had extra cash I would have left immediately instead I had to slum it - you wont have to if you read this review.

<Content>Do not stay there. Really bad experience. The type of room booked and actually allocated were vastly different.Very unfriendly man at the reception. Did not accept the room and he would not refund the money. The rooms and linen were very dirty and looked used and not washed. Do not stay there. much better off anywhere else.

<Content>don't believe everthing you read booking in this hotel was done prior to reading the reviews on this website, After reading these reviews I was dreading the trip all together. When we arrived at the Cordial we were surprised.The hotel was of a reasonable condition, staff very helpful and breakfast was good. The rooms were clean and although slightly small were more then enough for what we needed. price good, hotel good, location good. what more do you want?

<Content>There is better for the cash! I am a veteran of a dozen Amsterdam trips and I have to say that this is the worst place I have ever stayed at in this amazing city.The staff were OK-ish but the grubby, aged interior of the hotel definately rubs off on them and shapes their moods! It's central, cheap and not so cheerful. I would honestly avoid.For less money you can rent an apartment off Frederic.nl and he is the epitomy of what a stay in Amsterdam should be. Polite, jovial, warm and welcoming.

Plus Mr. Lee, the manager, far from being apologetic was rude and impolite. Please stay elsewhere

<Content>Good location, small rooms I stayed in this hotel for 7 nights with my husband. The location is great, close to the shopping area, Madame Tussaud, the flower market etc. The rooms were small. We were offered to chose between 2 rooms, one that faced the street and was VERY small and another that faced a brick wall and was ok in size. We chose the second one because of the size and the quietness. In the street they build a metro station and there is a lot of noise at times. The breakfast was good enough.

Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Very Basic Stayed here this weekend with 6 other guys on a 40th do.The location is great for all that is Amsterdam.The actual room we stayed in was miniscule for two blokes and was in desperate need of a facelift .I cant understand why we had a tv that was LCD High tech 2006 yet the bed cover looked like 1966. As a hotel to crash in with blokes for the weekend it was merely adequate and I'm not even a fussy guy but I wouldnt take my missus here. We had a view overlooking the roadworks but didnt hear them at all to be honest. I had no problems with the staff in the minimal interaction i had with them and they did let us keep our cases in a secure location after checking out.The breakfast is a joke cheese ham and a roll that wouldnt feed a mouse. We had a glass of juice and went for a full English elsewhere.This hotel is merely ok as a place to crash when your out on the lash with your mates.The shower was good though.

<Content>handy hotel Me and my partner stayed at the hotel cordial for 3 nights is june, and it was just what we wanted. the location was great, although there was some building works going on, but that didnt bother us at all. just a short walk from dam and rembrandt square is was very handy!! the room was quite small but everything was clean and suited our weekend, we weren't expecting the ritz!!!!! would go back, although would prob stay in the red light district next time as that was so funny!!!

<Content>Great Location but My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and found it ok for the money in Amsterdam. The room was very small but I don't think that is unusual in Amsterdam. The rooms were cleaned every day by reasonably friendly staff. The reception staff were pretty unhelpful except for one man who was on duty at the weekend who helped us out one night when our neighbours decided to discuss their evening pretty noisily outside their door for an hour at 2 in the morning.The other reviewers are right when they say this place is run down and it could certainly do with having some money spent on it (air freshner for a start). I wouldn't stay here again it is just too run down and degraded.

<Content>Great hotel I have returned after a weekend away with the lads, and I have to say we had no problems whatsoever. Nice friendly staff, room was ok, and lets face it, in Amsterdam, you only need a room. If you are used to 4* Hotels, I would look elsewhere, but if you want a room with no frills, this is your place. Great location also, 2 mins walk to Dam Saquare, and about 10-15 mins from Central Station.

<Content>Go elsewhere! I visited Amsterdam with some friends last weekend and we had the misfortune of staying at the Hotel Cordial. There were 4 of us, 3 girls who shared a room and a male friend who had a room by himself. Both rooms were small and dingy. The girls' room stank of stale smoke on arrival (and the smell never really went away as if it had permeated the curtains and the carpet) and the view was non existant since it gave onto an alleyway and all we could see was the wall opposite. My male friend's room was hardly better because, although it gave onto the Rokin, it was very noisy due to the heavy works going on at the moment. The hotel is in dire need of a facelift as the whole place has a grubby feel to it which is very unpleasant. The staff are borderline rude and could hardly be called welcoming. You got the impression that they would rather be somewhere else (and who could blame them?!). The breakfast is OK but nothing special. Amsterdam is a fantastic city and I am sure there are many cheap-ish hotels available so my advice is to look elsewhere. I travel quite a bit and I find it really galling when hotels get away with poor service, like this one.

<Content>dont do it!! do not book this hotel!!!!we reserved rooms for 11 people back in february for the weekend of 21st april for my brothers 21st birthday. we booked via a web site that was supposed to make it easy to book . we received confirmation emails to say our booking was complete. the booking agent rang us 2 days before departure to say that the hotel had cancelled the rooms due to a problem with the debit card number. i immediately phoned the hotel to sort the confusion and they told me the rooms were now cancelled and let to somebody else and they hung up on me!! the booking agent said they were not responsible for the hotels action and were unfortunately not able to find us alternative rooms. i was horrified and had to spend 8 hours on the wednesday before dpearture on the internet trying to find rooms for 11 guys for that friday. i eventually got a late cancellation at 11.30pm in a hotel 10km outside amsterdam instead of the central rooms we had booked well in advance during one of amsterdams busiest weekends of the year. the hotel managed to hang up on me and my partner and another booking agent trying to help us 4 times during the same day continually saying your rooms are cancelled. they could have ruined what should have been a fab weekend and i was simply lucky through persistence to find them alternative rooms. leave this hotel well alone.

<Content>GREAT BUDGET HOTEL Just returned from a two night stay at hotel cordial, 3rd visit to amsterdam.Just 8 mins walk from central station in an ideal location, (apart from building works but its unavoidable in amsterdam at present, but with the window shut through day it bocks out most of the noise.Only 2 mins walk from dam square, lots of eating and drinking places surrounding, shopping on the doorstep and lots of attractions only walking distance.We were given the choice of 4 different double rooms on arrival, we choose 4th floor, our room was clean, and nicely presented,could do with a lick of paint but its ok. In the room was a hairdryer, tv with some english channels,a walldrobe, dressing table and a large mirror.The ensuite was very small with just a shower and toilet, which were kept very clean and 4 towels were provided.Our room was cleaned during our stay and bed made.Breakfast was traditional dutch was served in a cosy breakfast room,comprising of cereal, bread rolls, ham, salami,cheese and boiled eggs, all fresh and nicely presented. The waiter kept filling our cups with coffee or tea when we were empty.I havent got any bad views of hotel cordial,for a budget hotel i found it excellent value for money.I will be booking to stay again on my next visit to amsterdam.

<Content>Great location, but beware the Silent Assassins. Just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam and was pleasantly surprised with the Hotel Cordial.The location is great. 2 minutes walk from Dam Square (The Centre Point of Amsterdam) it is perfectly located for enjoying Amsterdam, bars and clubs and coffee shops are less that 10 minutes staggering time away. The main shopping street is located behind the hotel and the floating flower stalls are 5 minutes walk away. Central station is no more than 15 minutes walk.Our room was a decent size with good facilities and clean. If you are looking to spend more time in the room than in the city, then stay elsewhere, but as a base to explore and enjoy the fun of the city, it's great.There are extensive road works happening in front of the hotel but they were finished by 6pm and not on the Sunday that we were there. As a family hotel I would not recommend the Cordial, but for couples or travelling friends, its perfectly located, clean and adequate and if you say thank you to the receptionist in Dutch (Dank) they are easier to deal with.The Silent Assassins, by the way, are the cyclists who abound within the city. You watch out for trams and cars and next second find a bicycle charging towards you waiting for the last second to ring their bell. And there are another 20 bikes behind that one. Scary but it heightens your reflexes.All in all, the Cordial is a welcome tonic, great location, decent rooms and facilities, just don't buy coffee from the bar, it's expensive and you don't get much in a cup.
