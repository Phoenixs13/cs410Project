<Content>Bad hotel Poorly maintained and outdated hotel. Stayed there only one night. Got in late at night and could not wait to check out the next morning. Staff was not friendly nor professional. Room was dirty, dark and smelly. The first room that I was given had a large bag of leftover dinner sitting on the counter from someone else. The bedsheet and pillow cases were wrinkled, although the room seemed to have already been made up. I was provided another room. A little better, but below typical Country Inn standard. The sink faucat was leaking, and toilet was running all night long. Two out of five light bulbs in the room was burnt out. Carpet was old and dirty. Free breakfast was horrible - poor selection, danishes were stale and pre-cut in halves. Dining room was dark (5 out of 17 light bulbs were burnt out and was not replaced). Would not recommend for families especially with children.

<Content>Great staff! Comfortable rooms! Good rate! An ice storm caused me to stay over in Dallas, but I found the staff warm (unlike the outside temperature) and especially helpful in making me comfortable during my unexpected stay. Having on-site laundry facilities helped, too, so I could wear clean clothes on my trip home. The hotel had a continental breakfast with plenty of choices and the high speed internet access allowed me to get some work done while I was there. When things thawed out a little, I made my way to the Galleria Mall nearby for some shopping before continuing home. Overall, I can definitely recommend the hotel for someone looking for a friendly, affordable hotel with easy freeway access in North Dallas.
