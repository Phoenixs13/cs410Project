<Content>On the Tracks!!!! Only for railway fans. Stayed on first floor. Trains passing your window - room shakes - till late at night and then first thing in morning. Sleep almost impossible. Luckily staying only one night otherwise would have ended up a gibbering wreck.Complained and asked for reduction, Response was short and to the point - tough!.Not to be repeated.

<Content>Great reception and breakfast Exceedingly helpful receptionist who not only spoke fluent English but also tolerated my feeble attempts to speak German. Excellent breakfast - buffet style which a huge variety (no smoking at breakfast time).Had spotlessly clean room on No Smoking floor.Unfortunately smoking was allowed in Dining Room in evening but the receptionist/waitress let us have our meal in hotel lobby, away from the smoke.Not the prettiest area of Berlin but only a few minutes away from U Bahn Station and convenient for Lichtenburg Mainline Station.

<Content>Avoid 2nd floor rooms facing the railway Hotel located in a scruffy area of the city. My room was average but there wasn't a way of drawing the curtains at night so light came in early in the morning.My workmate was unlucky and had a room on the 2nd floor facing the railway so he couldn't sleep (floor trembling each time a train passed by, window at train level, etc). Breakfast was excellent!! with full range of fresh food, coffee, fruit, different types of bread... Staff was nice  helpful but they had some difficulties speaking english. They had a good restaurant service (food nicely cooked). It is close to the public transport.

<Content>"Hostile" Reception and dificult to communicate in English. Rooms, breakfast, cleaning ness and location (鈥渋n a scruffy area鈥? were reasonable for the rates paid鈥ut the reception was Hostile and difficult to communicate in English. The one (she) spoken English never smiled and made you feeling embarrassed whenever you asked for information; the other two, seamed to be polite but unable to communicate in English 鈥?I consider English as a tool to communicate in hotels with international clientele and nothing else.

<Content>Not bad at all The rooms were small, but the bathroom was a decent size. The area isnt the prettiest (east-side) but its very close to public transport and you can get everywhere quickly and easily. The best thing was the breakfast - fantastic! I would recommend it as a comfortable and quite central hotel. Perfect for a short stay to see Berlin.

<Content>80s timewarp Basic hotel in East Berlin in a scruffy area but good transport links. Room was clean and fairly comfortable, a little on the small side. Decor throughout was dated. Breakfast was good and staff helpful. Overall good value for money if you're just looking for somewhere to sleep.
