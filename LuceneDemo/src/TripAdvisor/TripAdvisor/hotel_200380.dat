<Content>Needs a renovation The Meineke is very conveniently situated just off the Ku'damm in the former West Berlin. I emailed the hotel a week before our stay about some confusion over the room rate, but never got a response. One receptionist was very pleasant and the other was brisk but not unfriendly. As for the hotel itself, the entrance hall was very impressive, and it all went downhill from there. The beautiful period lift was out of order, the carperting frayed as you approached the reception, and the wood on the counter chipped. We then had to walk through a dark corridor with frayed carpets and a general air of decay into a rather rickety (modern) lift which took us to our room on the 4th floor. Another corridor of similar ilk later, we found ourselves standing in a run-down room with a window about 5 inches wide, with furniture that had seem far better times. The bed linen was spotlessly crisp and the double bed was a little bit hard, and the frame incredibly creaky - you would not be able to turn over without setting the whole frame off. Note that the double-beds have separate duvets, although we prefer this to a single duvet. The bathroom looked like nothing had been done to it since the early 60s, although it was relatively clean.Breakfast was uninspiring but included in the rate.So, the price is good if you are going to spend minimal time in the hotel in West Berlin, but would not recommend it for anybody who wants a place to relax in after a long day sightseeing.

<Content>Good base for citybreak Spent a long weekend at the Mark Hotel Meineke at end of Oct 08., as a group of 6 people visiting Berlin for the first time.Picked this hotel based on earlier reviews and would confirm the positive sentiments of previous visitors.On the positive the hotel is well placed for visitors to the city. The hotel and street are generally quiet, even though quite close to two main thoroughfares. It is also convenient for the transport network.The standard rooms are comfortable, and although not huge are perfectly adequate for such a stay. The hotel staff were welcoming and efficient, changing one room for a couple who found their shower was faulty, without any problems.The breakfast (included in our Expedia deal) offered a good choice, and was well presented.Yes, as mentioned in earlier reviews the decor could perhaps do with a re-paint in some areas, but all in all a very pleasant experience.Must mention that there are some very good, well priced restaurants on the same street. Also must mention the transport system is very very good, and would certainly recommend taking advantage of the visitor pass - which covers all transport (bus/train/tram etc), and avoids messing about buying tickets for each trip.Good memories, and that is always a good sign.Otto, Southampton

<Content>Good hotel in a great city The Meineke Hotel is clean and efficient and the buffet breakfast was more than adequate, if a little uninspiring. Being close to the Ku-dam (100 yds) meant plenty of bars, cafes and shops were on the doorstep. Also the Zoo terminal, i.e. the S- and U-bahn and the Number '100 bus' was just over 5 minutes walk away. From there Berlin opens up. The Hotel itself was quiet and the staff and guests (almost all German) were very approachable and friendly. Our tips if you are staying here: Try the Hamlet Restaurant on the Uhlandstrasse and the Hard Rock Caf茅 right across the road from the Hotel. The former for exceptional dining at around 拢13 for a main course. The lamb and duck were first class. The H.R.C. for a great burger accompanied by music and terrific service for about the same price.If you ask for a beer you'll be served a Berliner (lager). Most bars have quite a few to choose from so check out the menu first. Also, there were no disappointing Rieslings on any of the wine lists we tried. Wear your most comfortable walking shoes and be prepared to walk as it鈥檚 the best way to explore. We were there for 5 days but wished we had stretched it to a week. Places to visit are too numerous to list but the memorial under the remnants of the Wall and the Memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe (or the Haulocost Museum as some referred to it) are essential. Also go on the 'Famous Walk' on your first full day 鈥?I'd recommend Insider Tours at 12 Euros. It's the best 12 euros you'll spend. Andrew (the Aussie PhD student) was amazing and kept us hanging on his every word for 4 hrs +. A great city and a Hotel in a great location, which I'd definitely recommend.

<Content>Perfect stay I come back from 6 days in Berlin where I stayed at this excellent hotel, I had read mostly positive reviews about it and some negatives, well, personnally I have only good feedback to give.My main satisfaction is the quiet nights and good sleep I had there, something which is extremely rare to experience in an hotel of whatever quality. The hotel is in an old-fashioned building, very 'berlinesque', very pleasant, very clean, the breakfast is a little expensive but in great abundance (eat as much as you want buffet ) the staff is very nice, the room was very comfortable, the bed excellent, I could not think of single bad thing to say about the whole place. I will definitely book there when I'll go back to Berlin.Josephien

<Content>Change of Name, but Same Hotel This hotel is now known as the Mark Hotel Meineke. Don't confuse it with the larger Mark Hotel opposite. I would agree with the general tone of previous comments. The hotel has some very nice original architectural features, but it needs rennovation. Its location is convenient and quiet.With a very low rate from Expedia it was reasonable value, but in general it is flattered by its 3* rating.

<Content>Great Location, Dated Hotel, Rude Service The Hotel is in a great location a mere block from the Ku'damm shopping area. The hotel it self is very dated and dark. Due to the entrance of the hotel, this is definately not for the Elderly or Disabled. We booked 4 DOUBLE rooms and were given all singles, further they gave away one of the rooms entirely. When the issues were discussed we were told there were no guarantees, however no refund or make up for the difference in price. When I stated that I would contact the location from which I booked they stated We will get our money anyway! Choose any one of the other great hotels in the same area.

<Content>Stay at the Meineke Arte Hotel Beautiful old building. Steps from main shopping on the Ku'dam  subway. The room was huge. Don't fall out of the garage-sized window. Bed very comf. The washroom was massive. Breakfast was great - I need their recipe for the breakfast sausage/meatballs. Picturesque wrought iron elevator wasn't working while we were there - lots of stairs, though I think there was another elevator at the rear of the building. Highly recommended!

<Content>Good value at 35 euros per night Great location, around corner from Zoo station.Nice and quiet. I was on business so booked as a single. Room was old but had a charm with tall ceilings along with long windows. Needless to say in true German fasssion everything was spotless. Forget the breakfast as the coffeee was cold and hot food terrible even though I was down early at 7-00. Try eating at the arcade across the road where you see the Lidl sign. Stay if you get at good price.

<Content>Disaster I booked 3 rooms this hotel in July 2006. Six of us were travelling to Berlin from Edinburgh for New Year. We were arriving on the 29th Dec and departing 1st Jan. About 4 weeks ago I reconfirmed our booking with the Hotel by telephone and asked about transport from Tegel Airport to the hotel. When we arrived on the 29th we were told the hotel had been over booked and was full. We were to be move to an apart hotel about 2kms away, part of a global chain, where three rooms had been booked for us.The manager of the hotel had already left for the day (6pm). She was eventually contacted by telephone, but with rooms at a premium over the holiday we had little option but to accept this forced alternative. I learned that the apart hotel had only been booked 4 days previously. Our rooms were obviously sold on to a higher bidder!Do not use this hotel!!

<Content>Great location but tired hotel Very central location, friendly staff, clean, good breakfast and big high ceiling rooms. However must say that the hotel look tired and needs a refurb. Theres no AC and the summer months gets hot in Berlin. Are you staying a few days and not spending long in the room then i recommed this inexpensive hotel. Not suited for special occasions as it doesnt give an immediate great first impression when you walk in the lobby.

<Content>Good location, helpful staff, rooms v hot! Just spent three nights at this well located hotel in the west of the city. Well placed for the Kudamm and shopping delights plus good restaurants and cafes nearby.Hotel had only one review on Trip Adviser when I booked. Usually rely on feedback from this site. Booked with lastminute and rate was 90 euros per night for a large double room and breakfast. Emailed hotel beforehand as the review said the rooms were stuffy. Had a quiet room on 4th floor which was average decor with bath and shower - no shower curtain though! It was very hot in Berlin over the weekend and the room was very warm.Breakfast was cold buffet style in a pleasant room overlooking the main street. The staff were very helpful and spoke excellent English which saved embarassment with my pre-O level German.Excellent restaurant two streets away in Uhlandstra脽e called the Schildkrote which serves traditional Berliner fare - always busy with locals. Also worth a visit is the Loretta Bier Garden a short stroll away.

<Content>Great location, stuffy room Stayed for 3 nights at the Meineke Arte Hotel, during a very hot and humid spell in Berlin. Excellent location a block from the Ku'damm and close to restaurants in Savignyplatz (10 min walk), but it was quite quiet even though it faced a few other hotels and the Hard Rock Cafe. Staff was friendly, there was a fruit bowl up front for the taking, along with a small hotel bar. A few nice touches in terms of art (hence the Arte Hotel...). Our room was decent, nothing special, but the closet was falling apart and there wasn't any ventilation, so it got even more stuffy after taking a shower. Worth booking for the convenient location and if you get a good deal online.
