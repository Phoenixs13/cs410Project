<Content>Early breakfasts abound at Fairfield Inn We stayed here on our 4 night visit to Dallas to see some friends from college. This is a basic Fairfield Inn. The location is good for things in North Dallas. Breakfast was included in the price, although it ended at 10 am on Saturdays and Sundays and 9 am on weekdays. For me, this is too early. We found it difficult to wake up and be ready for breakfast by 9 am. Also, the interenet was free, but it was rather difficult to figure out how to use. We had to call the front desk for help. It should not have been that difficult.

<Content>Wow, we loved this hotel. We truly thought this hotel was a find. Thanks to TripAdvisor, we decided to try this hotel for our 5-day January trip. The staff was very helpful the entire stay, but they went above-and-beyond at check-in. They actually lowered our internet rate by $10; that never happened before! They also offered to move us to another floor for our last day, when a teen bus group arrived. We declined their offer, but it seemed they were always looking out for us. Their breakfast was juice, waffles, bagels, yogurt, cereal, and apples. The breakfast room was kept stocked and clean, and had a large flat-screen TV. Every morning a free USA Today was placed at our door. Our room was super clean, as was the exercise room with a big flat screen TV. Both beds in our room were excellent, and there were big and small pillow choices. We were few blocks from all the restaurants on Belt Line Road; a big plus. The area was very safe and quiet, with an upscale condo across the street. We also liked how easy it was to get around with LBJ freeway, Midway Road, and Spring Valley Road easy connections to any direction. Our only complaint was the vanity area was very small.

<Content>Very decent, basic hotel-Clean but no wireless net!! The hotel is basic and clean. I would stay here again. The front desk attendants were helpful and courteous. The only negatives about the hotel were that there is no wirless internet. In this day and age, everyone should have free wireless internet. They do have high speed internet available if you pull the Cat-5 cord out of the closet and plug it in to their portal on the desk in the room. Don't be fooled if they say they have wireless internet- that is true but it is only available in the lobby which is very pointless.Overall I liked the place. It's not much for decor, but as I said before, the rooms were clean and comfortable. The shower was clean and it had good presure and a nice showerhead. The bed and bedding were comfortable and soft.

<Content>Loved the bed! My husband and I stayed overnight before my trip out of town. I was not impressed with the front desk staff, who were less than friendly. The room was great, and the bed was even better. I really liked the bedding, which was different from your typical hotel-bio-hazard-bedspread. It was crisp white and felt very clean. The hotel provided a great continential breakfast with lots of on-the-go choices and they had great complimentary shuttle service at 4:30am to get me to the airport on time (allowing my husband to sleep in).

<Content>Very good overall The only reason I didn't rate this hotel as excellent is because of the small room size and lack of bathroom amenities. Our room (2 doubles) was OK for 2 people, but 3 or 4 would have been a crowd. There was no closet, just the tubular metal shelf and hanging rod. Bathroom light was rather dim, but acceptable. The only bathroom amenity provided was a bar of soap and shampoo. Breakfast bar was very good and attendant kept it stocked and clean. In fact, the breakfast bar attendant was the biggest help during my stay. I had a flat tire and she went out of her way to tell me the closest place to get it fixed and she called to see if it was open on Sunday and what time it opened! This location is very convenient to the Galleria, North Park Mall, Valley View Mall, lots of restaurants,  a Firestone Tire Center! A gas station/convenience store is right beside the hotel.

<Content>A very pleasant stay. My review may be slightly prejudiced by the fact that I got a room on the first floor, almost across from the little exercise room (with a treadmill and step machine in good working order, and a high-def TV with cable), and a few steps from the pocket-sized indoor swimming pool. Still, the room was clean and comfortable and of a decent size, and the area, a half-block from two major roads, was safe and quiet, and the staff was eager to please, and the continental breakfast was decent. No restaurant on-site, but there are more with a mile's drive than you would believe. The desk help will tell you how to get anywhere you need to. (If you don't have a computer with you, there's a Kinko's about five minutes away where you can get Internet access and printing cheap.) My AAA rate from Marriott.com was $76.50 per night. What more do you want?

<Content>Very nice. Among the best of the chain. This hotel was extremely comfortable, clean, and reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly, and the applicances in the room were all modern and in good working order. I couldn't think of a single thing wrong with this hotel.This is a great area to stay for business travelers. There are so many amenities nearby that it was worth staying here and driving into downtown Dallas rather than staying down there where everything shuts down at night.

<Content>Unexceptional....and that's a compliment! This Fairfield Inn is unexceptional in that it simply delivers on Marriott's promise: clean, comfortable rooms; friendly service; guest-driven amenities; and a price that won't strain the budget. Both Marriott  this property really know their business: this hotel is designed for busy, working professionals, as well as for anyone else that looks for both value  quality. The free high-speed Internet access is terrific; the complimentary breakfast is well-stocked and satisfying; the fitness room  indoor pool provide ample opportunities to keep fit while on the road; and they even set up a complimentary, old-timey popcorn cart every afternoon to provide a snack at check-in. Nothing fancy here....just quality accommodations at a fair price provided by customer-oriented staff.

<Content>Great Bargain The rate was great and the service was fantastic! The people treated me like family. One of the best continental breakfasts I've encountered. The rooms are clean and look like new. High speed internet access was an added bonus.
