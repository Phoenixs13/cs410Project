<Content>Great budget hotel Having been to Barcelona before and stayed in a plush hotel, my friend and I decided to return on a very tight budget.We were expecting the worst, given that it only cost us 拢26 per night. However we were pleasantly surprised.On arrival in the room (3rd floor), it was tiny, nowhere to store suitcases etc and the bed was literally against the door (to open the door you had to pull the sheets onto the bed). It was, however, very clean. The sheets perfectly white, and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was again tiny, but very clean.It wasn't luxurious by any standard, but keps very clean and the staff were very helpful (except the moody ones in the bar).The location of the hotel was perfect. Slap bang in the middle of Ramblas (for day time) and Port Olympic (for bars restaurants clubs etc), just a 15 min walk to both (or a 5 Euro taxi ride)Overall for the money we paid it was excellent value. I will be coming to Barcelona again in March and will probably stay here again.

<Content>Look elsewhere My wife and I stayed at the Santa Marta hotel during our holiday in Barcelona (4 days). It was one of many destinations we were traveling to, but it was by far our least favorite (worst experience). I wish we would have heeded the reviews on Trip Advisor and looked elsewhere because this hotel, if you can call it that, was terrible. If you are used to the hostel environment then this hotel will be a small step up, (Later we found out that it was a converted hostel) but if you're looking for a place where you can rest your head, have some peace, and be comfortable...you better think again. I am a pretty easy going and experienced traveler. I have stayed in all kinds hotels, but this was by far one of the worst. My hotel in Uganda was heaps better than this place. My wife and I had a room on the top floor (6), which seemed to be in some sort of transition because the other floors appeared to be in better condition. We had seperate beds placed next together. You can feel each individual spring from the mattress in your back and the pillow is obsolete. The room is tiny and has very little, if any, storage space. It is a tight fit. The bathroom is somewhat redeeming since its a bit more roomy. The entire hotel smells of cigerette smoke, so get used to that. However, the worst part of the hotel is that the walls are incredibly thin. You might as well be staying in a tent because you can hear everything! I literally joked with my wife one night because I could hear our neighbors flick the light switch on! Its laughable now, but during our stay we were not happy. We would have looked else where if a refund was available. Please, look somewhere else. Even if it costs you some extra cash. This place is the pits.

<Content>Great location, awful room We had stayed here last year and had a good experience - clean room, helpful staff etc. This year the room was awful, dark smelly, dank and tiny. We were on honeymoon and it really spoilt the experience. We'll go back to Barcelona but not to this hotel.

<Content>awful On a positive note the hotel rooms were cleaned every day and it is in a central area to all the districts of Barcelona- the beach is a 10-15 mins walk away- this is where the positive comments end. Having read reviews prior to my stay I knew that rooms were going to be on the small side but I did not realise how small, also the bathroom was very long and narrow, and it smelt of sewerage. The wardrobes are really tiny so not good if you take lots of things and there wasn鈥檛 enough space to store the suitcases anywhere so we had to put them on the floor at night and on the beds in the day time. I had booked two rooms as we were going for a friends hen party (there were 4 females), when we checked in we were given rooms on different floors even though we requested that they be near each other, when we asked if we could have rooms near each other the man on reception became rude and nasty with us stating that we had made 2 separate bookings when I had in fact booked and paid for the rooms in one transaction. We let this go and went to our separate rooms not wanting anything to ruin our holiday. At 2 o clock in the morning (the first night) a strange man came into my friend鈥檚 room whilst they were both asleep- luckily the light from the hall woke them up and he disappeared (one benefit of small rooms) a few minutes later a psycho woman next door started shouting and swearing, she turned her TV up full and started banging on their wall continuously. Both of my friends were really shook up- 1st from the strange man then from the bizarre behaviour of this woman. They both had to seek refuge in mine and my sisters room (four woman in 2 single beds) none of us slept for the rest of the night. First thing in the morning we went down and complained to a different man on reception- he didn鈥檛 seem bothered/ worried by the fact that a strange man was able to get into my friends room (the hotel use room cards) and he offered us no explanation as to how this was even possible. At first he tried telling us that they couldn鈥檛 have a new room even though we said that they did not feel safe in that room. When he realised that we weren鈥檛 going to let the matter drop he made some phone calls and offered my friends a room on the same floor as my room. Their new room was twice the size of their old room. After this we were very wary and hired a safe- not wanting to take any chances. The breakfast itself consisted of fruit juice, tea or coffee and a croissant which is ok if you're not a big eater. As we had paid for bed and breakfast we expected a better breakfast as this was the only meal we were paying for. Barcelona itself is a lovely city with something for everyone, so don鈥檛 let this review put you off the city- just the hotel was bad. It definitely isn鈥檛 suited to a group of young women.

<Content>Pretty shabby Just returned from Barcelona which was a great city.Let down by the hotel.Expect a 2* to be pretty basic but really think this one could do with a complete refurbishement.Smelly drains.very shabby rooms,lights hanging off the wall  stained bed covers.Night time was a fight with the mossies  the walls are paper thin!Breakfast uneatable - a sweet roll  a croissant left on a plate - the later apparentely tasted as if it had been coated in meat fat.Bar would be ok I suppose as long as you like it smokey.Not that good value compared to what you get for one more ***Good places to eat although expect to pay a lot for beers - and we are used to high prices !!Will return but not to the SM

<Content>Not too bad I have spent one week in barcelona with a friend. The santa marta is a very old hotel with no comforts. I was on the 6th floor (there is the lift). The room was very small. No space for the bags.Air conditioning. No hairdryier in the bath (shower and bathtube). The windows were broken. the breakfast was not good but eatable. BUT the room had been cleaned every day and the hotel is only 15-20 minutes to the Cathedral and Rambla (by FOOT) and near the port. So you don't need to take the underground! bUT Underground station was just around the corner (BARCELONETA) as the train station Estacio de Fran莽a For me was great. Not too noisy. If you are not interested in luxury hotel the santa marta is perfect

<Content>Cheap and kind of cheerful After reading some reviews I was a bit worried about this hotel, but chose it because it was close to the Barcelonetta beaches. I was really pleased when I saw the room, OK so it was tiny, but it was very clean (as if it had just been renovated). It had a new TV and a bright orange David Lynch style telephone. It didn't smell or anything. You can hear people talking, but I stayed during the week so I guess it was quieter, so I had no problems with this. Breakfast is crap - but there are lots of other options nearby.The staff were not particularly friendly - I asked if I could stay another night because I had underbooked a night in BCN but the guy just said they are very full. So, it's a great location, it's cheap and my room was clean and decent enough. Oh yeah and I walked into my room once and found a huge pair of men's underpants on the floor. It was a bit of a shock, but I guess the cleaner had dug them out from under the bed or something. So the hotel has some comedy value as well.

<Content>Aviod like the plague Please think twice before booking this hotel. We arrived in the beautiful city of Barcelona, and took a cab to the hotel, It took 2 hours to get checked in, and when we finally got to our room, I could of cried. The room stank, there was actual sick over walls, blood in the bed, the loo hadn't been cleaned from the previous guests, The lamps were hanging off the walls, you could see the wires hanging out, it was just horrid. We went to the reception to complain, and the chap at the desk decided he couldnt speak any English - even though he had perfect English when we checked in! Anyway, when we started to raise our voices, he said someone would come and clean the room, so we headed into Barcelona to start our holiday whist they cleaned the crap up. After a long day of sighseeing, and eating Tapas, we headed back to our room, and there was a hole in the door, and the room had been broken into, they stole my boyfriends shoes, my coat, sunglasses, makeup, toiletries, even my pj's!! basically everything that wasnt in our suitcases, We ran to reception to report this, and there was another couple there who had had money and passports stolen, again, the guy behind reception decided he couldnt understand us, and couldnt speak any English. The 4 of us then went to the Police Station to report the crime, The Police were brill and took the details, and said that they would come to the hotel the next day to look around, I must say, I was a bit scared to stay there that night, I would of loved to of checked out that night, and found another hotel, but my boyf pursuaded me to stay, : (Anyway, the police came round the next day, and they even took photo's of our room, to be honest, I think this had happened before at this hotel. On another night, we were off out, and opened the lift door, just about to step in, and the electric went off, we were in complete darkness, OMG, we could of been in that blooming lift! So, basically, what I'm trying to say, please please try and find a different hotel to stay in, Barcelona is a fab city, I cant wait to go back, but I will steer clear from this [--]! xcuse my french!

<Content>Great hotel! Great hotel, do not get scared by other peoples stories! Me and my boyfriend stayed there for almost a week and it was above our expectations! I got really worried by reading the rewievs on this site but for a two stars hotel it was very clean, good service and safe.The location to the beach was great, just five minutes and about 15 min walk to las ramblas. We stayed there for 395 euro for 5 nights and i would definitely stay there again and recommed this hotel to my friends!I booked this hotel with yeego.com, no problems!

<Content>What's the problem?? After reading reviews of the hotel I was very nervous, the upside being I was plesently surprised on arrival!Firstly do not follow the hotel's instructions to get to the hotel by train from the airport-this involves 3 train and metro changes when actually the train from the airport goes every half hour to the estacio de franca which is right outside the hotel! so so easy and costs only 2.50 euros. Check in was easy, didnt even have to speak really, were just handed key! Room was very tiny, but modern, clean and bright with a little balcony overlooking a very cute square. Beds were fine, shower good and room cleaned and towels changed every day by truly lovely staff. Some rooms are situated arund a square landing and others off a corridor. Ours was on a corridor which meant there were noises from the corridor (but thats probably our fault for sleeping in til lunchtime!) But I never heard a peep from any neighbours, so I think the walls between rooms are very well soundproofed. Best thing about the hotel was the location, lovely 10 min walk along the seafront to la ramblas and port vell. very close to barcelonetta metro station which is on a very convienient line.A short walk through cute little old streets to all the major tourist attractions, and a 5 min hop to the beach!The whole area is described as the 'hippest' in barcelona and felt very safe. yes the street outside the hotel is a bit smelly, but lots in the old town are!Overall remarkably good value for money, the hotel is two star mainly duue to its lack of facilities, though it does provide a free breakfast and other meal, though we never tried them. Please do not be put off by bad reviews, i would stay there again, a bargain for 拢25 per person a night!

<Content>Good location This was basic accommodation with minimal wardrobe space (you get what you pay for). Rooms were cleaned every day, towels also changed. Staff were pleasant, however the walls were very thin and you could hear your neighbours. City noise at night included deliveries and dustcarts. Breakfast was continental.

<Content>Like the Curate's Egg - good in parts... If you want a cheap hotel that is extremely close to the main train station, a stone's throw from shops, cafes and bars, and where rooms are cleaned daily, this is the place to stay. If you want light and airy, spacious and well-appointed, with great views and facilities, I'm afraid you're going to draw the short straw, especially if you get to the hotel when the majority of its rooms are full with a coach party of students and you end up at the top/back of the hotel. My partner and I booked a room here through an accommodation website on the net, as we had never been to Barcelona before and wanted a VERY CHEAP place to stay. And for us, the stay was very cheap - the equivalent of 拢30 a night (for the room, not per person). The Pros: the hotel is literally a two minute walk from the station - even with luggage - and less than a 10 minute walk to the Ramblas, the harbour area, the city's best park, and the main bus stops for the Bus Tourista - the best value way to find out about the city on your first visit - 23 Euros at the time of writing for a two-day ticket. Each room at the hotel has its own bathroom facilities, even if these (in some rooms) are below the standard you would normally expect when staying in, say, a 3 Star hotel in London. The 'baths' are more like 2ft deep shower trays, so forget long soaks. Each room has bedside lights, a dressing table, a wardrobe and a small TV. Again, not up to some people's standards - just the basic channels in Spanish - so don't complain about the lack of Sky Sport. The reception area seems to be manned 24 hours a day, and while the staff I met weren't exactly 'Mr Congeniality', I think the language difficulties didn't help. While I never got to chat in more than a superficially friendly way with any of the staff, they were helpful whenever help was required.The Cons: the hotel is a typical bargain-end Spanish establishment, so yes, people will be hanging around in the bar/dining room, smoking, while having a very relaxed attitude to food hygiene rules. That's what they do: it's Spain. When we arrived, we were given a very small, dark room at the back of the hotel, with which I was prepared to 'make do' until I tripped on a loose fragment of bathroom tile (two or three were damaged). So the next day, I asked if we could move rooms. The chap was a bit 'put out' and said: Why didn't you say you didn't want the room last night? Fair comment, I thought, but I explained that a coach-load of students had just turned up, the place was heaving and I didn't want to cause a scene at reception. He shrugged in acknowledgement and after the head housekeeper was sent to the room with us (so that he could find out what was upsetting me), we got our room change. As for the coach-load of students, well some of the little darlings behaved just as you might expect and there were lots of 'technical difficulties' with the lift, while some of the wooden surfaces around the hotel now have charming little carvings, courtesy of the more artistic among them. While other reviewers have talked about shortcomings with some of the equipment /facilities in the rooms, I think, to be fair, a lot of this is down to damage caused by some of the hotel's guests. While I did asked to be moved because of damaged floor tiles, I don't think the hotel can be held responsible for how people behave. And as for comments about people sleeping on the pavement outside the hotel...well I have seen far worse on the streets of London. Like any big city, there is deprivation and hardship, which is always upsetting. But for the four days I stayed in this hotel, I didn't experience any problems immediately outside or around the building, even after dark. I think it is well worth considering this as a cheap, 'no frills' clean, safe base, simply because of where it is in relation to everything you'd want or need in the city during your stay.

<Content>Smelly and filthy Our party of eight were booked into this hotel after Globespan messed up our origional hotel booking. We arrived to find around fifteen people sleeping on the pavement nearby. There was also a strong smell of sewage comming from a drain just outside the main door. The hotel rooms were small, very shabby and had broken and chipped tiles, our rooms aircon leaked during the night and dripped into ,our suitcase soaking our clothes it was not repaired we had to place our hotel towels on the floor each night and the maid emptied the casing each morning onto the floor and used dirty towels from other rooms to mop up. other reviews mention the same problem with this room 111. Plaster was falling of the walls mildew was on the wall above the doors the bathroom was as clean as could be expected given that the tiles were broken and missing. one of our bed side lamps actualy dangled from its wires. When we went to the breakfast room we found the staff sitting arround smoking and casually handelling the pastries the crockery and cutlery were either chipped and or filthy, we had breakfast. at a cafe round the corner all in all this is a dump.

<Content>Much better than expected Booked the hotel for myself and 5 friends who spent three nights there, Was a bit alarmed when I saw some of the reviews but was pleasantly surprised to find the rooms were very clean, staff very helpful, location was excellent, you can get the train from the Station Franca just around the corner to the airport!. Overall I would recommend it for anyone staying for a few nights break.

<Content>Faulty Towers  After reading previous comments very unsure. When my wife  I arrived at Barcelona International Airport Taxi driver didnt have a clue 27euros later Santa Marta.Upon checkin Hotel manager had no booking or could not find one, He took our internet booking faxed it off and we were given room 104.Room was small but on suite  very very clean. Bath towels and bedding changed daily. Breakfast between 7 - 10 am very basic continental but what you would expect if still hungry local bars open at 7am and serve breakfast or lunches from 2 euros 300yards away.But what a location Franca main train station 2 miniute walk away 2.40euros to Barcelona airport 20 miniute journey. Cittadell Park 800yards away, Port 8 miniutes away and La Ramblas 15miniutes away Heaven!!!!Some previous comments are most unfair and unjust, Santa Marta is only 2* some previous underwriters should stay and sister hotels that are 3,4,  5* but oh yeah they would have to pay more. Some it seems want a palace but only pay a bedsit rate.Great stay good hotel no complaints will be returning with our children in the new year.

<Content>Absolute dump! Eight of us stayed at this hotel because we were double booked by globespan. We did not want to stay there but had no choice. It is horrible the rooms left a lot to be desired, breakfast room wasn't clean, staff were ignorant apart from one on reception. Give this hotel a miss!

<Content>Well, what can I say about Santa Marta............... Everything you've read about this hotel is true - both good and bad. Excellent location, but wouldn't want to spend too much time there. Very small room, but clean and tidy, although felt a bit like the princess and the pea with the beds!!! Was very disappointed with the breakfast. A stale old croissant and a brioche, jams and tea or coffee. Not too impressed with the waiter smoking at the bar area!! BUT, after seeing the funny side of it (Fawlty Towers eat your heart out), and the fact that just up the road you have the Gothic Quarter and Las Ramblas where they sell adequate continental breakfast and lots of other stuff, this is the perfect base if you are on a budget to explore the wonderful, cultural, architectural delights of Barcelona. Don;t be put off - if your monies are tight this is an ok base to explore from............although, once is enough!!!

<Content>fine for the the price! I went to this hotel earlier this year, yes thr other reviewers are correct, its not the best hotel, but what more do you want for the price. its in a great location, all the staff i come across in a 6 day stay spoke english, the bathrooms are clean and the showers hot. The bedrooms themselves are not brilliant but if u go to Barcelona you should be spending some more time out and about! I will be going back in a few weeks time and im staying there again!

<Content>Can't be that bad! Myself and a friend booked into the hotel Santa Marta and made the mistake of reading the reviews only the night before we left for Barcelona- understandably we were a bit nervous. Upon arriving at the hotel however we were told at the reception that we wouldn't be staying at the hotel due to broken air conditioning. Instead we were moved to a nearby 4 star hotel at no extra cost. Although we didn't stay at the Santa Marta we found the location convenient, the receptiion bright and staff friendly. It seemed that if the staff were prepared to move us to a 4 star hotel because of no air conditioning, then the comfort of the guests was a concern and that the Santa Marta can't be that bad afterall!

<Content>How did it even get 2* This is by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. It is located down a dark alley.There was mould growing on the walls and beds where damp .staff were nice but that cannot make up for the terrible state of the hotel. Do youself a favour and dont even think about staying here. there are some lovely hotels in barcelona but this is not one of them.

<Content>a Hell Hole! Do not stay in this hotel. I got stuck with it through priceline. The hotel is located in a very filthy neighborhood. The rooms are dirty. People at front desk are rude and very unfriendly - they will speak English if you are very lucky. Trust me, you can find better hotels at the same price else where: try venere.

<Content>oh dear, is it too late to book into another hotel First impressions count and on this occassion I very nearly chose to book out. Always use this site but on this occassion must not have read the reveiws. I chose thew hotel for its location - which is suberb if you like boats and cheap Tapas bars within walking distance.The foyer was crumbling and the wall paper peeling of the walls. The bedroom was a twin despite asking for a double. the bathroom although clean was so small it was impossible to dry yourself after having a shower.On the up side, if you are on a tight budget and can see past the very tired interior the staff were friendly and the rooms were warm and the showers hot. Did not look too carefully under the beds as thought it wise not to.

<Content>Wish i'd seen this site before we went I went to Barcelona for a weekend with my boyfriend in January of this year. I booked the Santa Marta on the Net in September 05 and i'm disgusted that i could have stayed in a decent hotel for the same price. I thought Barcelona was a fab city but this hotel ruined our weekend. We spent as little time as possible in the room over the weekend. We booked a double but got a twin. Thankfully i didn't see any bugs however i did get a rash on my skin from the sheets. I wouldn't have dared to go near the dining room I didn't even contemplate eating in the place. I would hate to think that anyone would book this hotel and ruin their trip to Barcelona. I will go back to the city but i'll check TripAdvisor before I book again.

<Content>Perfectly good at 2 star price I stayed for 2 nights here with a friend. No building work at all, no insects, room clean with clean linen and loads of clean towels. Airconditioning worked very well. Walls thin, but it wasn't noisy (next doors' early evening rendition of Pretty Woman in the shower not withstanding!). My friend's mattress was a bit saggy, but mine was very new. Very helpful staff. Evening meal much better than the breakfast. Excellent location.I'd stay again for 1 - 2 nights, but for longer, I'd pay a bit more for a better place. We got it for a cheaper price as part of an internal Spanish deal with a long-distance train trip.

<Content>Fine for the price We have just come back from staying in this hotel with a group of students. Our experience was not at all like most of your correspondents. Overall we felt that it was all, and perhaps a bit more, than you could reasonably expect from a hotel of this class. The location is good, quiet but handy for several museums and trendy areas. True it is near the place where visas are issued but we experienced none of the problems so luridly described by some people.The rooms are not large but perfectly adequate, comfortable, clean and safe. There was plenty of hot water and everything in the bathroom worked OK. We certainly didn't see any livestock. The lift is not in the first flush of youth but worked fine and we never saw staff using it. They seemed to toil up and down the separate back stairs.I can't imagine how people missed the fire exits; complete with automatically closing doors. The Breakfast is not the finest I have ever had but was adequate. The staff in the bar, and on reception, were pleasant and helpful. Their English is certainly better than my Spanish. I think perhaps some people have inflated ideas of what to expect of a hotel in this class. As some one else said if you want more pay more.

<Content>Not all of Barcelona can be so great My girlfriend and I planned an inexpensive getaway to Barcelona for a few days in April 2002. We found the Santa Marta on the Web and knew it was a risk but took a chance. On arrival, the lobby was a like a building site, the bar/restaurant was dirty and there were a sizable group of Scandinavian guests berating the manager for a number of reasons.With some trepidation we checked in and went up to our room. Despite asking for a double we were given a twin. The bedding was weathered, stained in places and not particularly clean. There was plenty of dust yet perhaps this was unsurprising as on our way up to our floor we discovered that half the hotel was a building site. I notice other reviews nearly two years on suggest little has changed in this regard.The bathroom was unclean, the window was dirty, the atmosphere was very musty and smelled of damp. We immediately went out on a late night tour of the city to find an alternative and luckily found the last available room, after visiting several hotels, in the Flor Parks on Las Ramblas. We returned to the Santa Marta and checked out less than an hour after checking in!This may be a 2 star establishment but our room and the hotel generally was unacceptable to paying guests. I would advise anyone not to ruin a trip to the most exceptional city I have visited in Europe, by staying at the Santa Marta.

<Content>The location is perfect Easy findable just a few minutes from Metro station Barcelonetta. Very good and central location also for walking anywhere you like. Most friendly reception who were also very helpful. Crowded breakfast-room (serves other hotels in the vicinity as well) with very basic orange-like breakfast. Orange juice, orange marmelade, croissants and pure oranges.The room was very small but clean with shower and bath tube. No carruches observed. Very well and quite operating air-con. If you plan to stay a lot in the room forget it, otherwise for sleeping and sight-seeingyou get what you pay at a very good location.

<Content>Dissapointing, but not the worst The Santa Marta hotel was the first hotel we stayed in when we got to Europe. We were expecting horrible conditions, but it ended up being better than we woulod have expected, but not much better. We ordered a single room, but they gave us a double, so we basically got an additional bed for free. However, one of the beds we stayed in only had three legs, and would shake wildly if you tried to roll around on the bed. Later on, we found the fourth leg, as it had rolled underneath the bed. The entire room stank of bleach the first time we entered, but the smell receded as the days went on. The bathroom was not very clean, but it was managable. The television was was there, but would not get any channels. The best part of it was the air conditioning, which was quiet yet powerful. Howver, it leaked about a gallon of water a day and we had to use towels and buckets to control the water. The walls are paper thin. I was frequently woken up by people upstairs flushing the toilet and night. You can basically hear everything a person says in the next room. The breakfast is a miserable pile of doo doo, as everything tastes a few days old. There were a few cockroaches and the elevator basically doesn't work, as it takes around 4 minutes to go from floor 1 to floor 6. The location is quite good though, it is pretty close to the beach, and many restaurants.

<Content>Simply the Worst! I have just read the other reviews and feel I must write in to tell people that these reviews are right. I unfortunately stayed in the hotel for a long weekend earlier this year. After arriving late on the Friday night, we went straight to bed, the rooms were v small, v dirty and most uncomfortable, although we luckily did not have any exposed wires in our room. We asked for a room with a bath, but what we got looked more like a large shower. At breakfast on the saturday morning my bag was stolen from the hotels restuarant, and when i wanted to report it to the police the staff were most unhelpful. The manager simply disappeared, and made no report at all to the police. When I asked to use a telephone to report my passport as stolen and to contact the British Consulate I was told to be quick as it would cost money for the international call!!! Luckily we had not booked half board, only bb, and we only had to suffer the breakfast, which consisted of bitter coffee and stale break. The walls were paper thin, our neighbours would listen to dance music at full blast to 6.00 in the morning, when i complained about this to reception no action was taken. I can not stress enough how horrendous this trip was. I wrote to the customer service web address, but have never received a reply. I have also wrote a letter of complaint to the president of the hotel chain, and await his responce! But i'm not holding my breath!!!

<Content>what's wrong with it??? My god!!! I read the reviews on this site before i stayed there last weekend and was so disheartened. I even rang the people I booked it through to try to cancel it on the grounds of 'no fire escape'. Obviously didn't work because I got back yesterday. There actually was a fire escape on every floor. If you're paying for a 2* hotel, a 2* hotel is what you'll get, nothing more. This hotel had everything i would expect from a hotel like this and even impressed me slightly (considering some of the places I've stayed int he past). Granted the rooms were small but they were perfectly adequate. The people in reception were more than helpful in suggesting places to go and calling taxis for us. It was only 15 minutes walk to Las Ramblas and just around the corner from the port - great for a morning walk. The worst thing about the hotel was the breakfast - croissants were a bit stale - but edible. Don't get disheartened if you're going to stay in this hotel, it's really not that bad.
