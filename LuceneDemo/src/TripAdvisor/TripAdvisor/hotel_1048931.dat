<Content>6-Star Spa If you're looking for a superior class spa in Lovina, this is the place. The hotel is in the $30-$80 range, like a lot of others on Lovina Beach, but the spa is far better than most 5-star hotels. They can accommodate couples, or even larger groups. The staff are well-trained and friendly. And the selection of treatments includes a large variety, including packages if you have time available. We also ate lunch at the restaurant, which was a mixture of Balinese and Chinese - adequate and a good price. The hotel is renovating some rooms, so expect some construction noise. We didn't stay overnight, so I can't vouch for the rooms, but go here for a fantastic spa.
