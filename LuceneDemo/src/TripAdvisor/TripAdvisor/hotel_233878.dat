<Content>Good price for Berlin Although a little way from the centre of Berlin the hotel is very close to the rail station and trains take as little as 10 minutes to the centre. However the price makes it worthwhile to stay out here. You can also explore Spandau on foot and there are plenty of eating drinking options close by. Standard Ibis hotel in terms on interior and facilities.
