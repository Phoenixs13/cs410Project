<Content>Excellent Hotel in the Downtown Area ! My business partner were visiting Downtown Phoenix for a Convention. I booked the Holiday Inn based on price and location. Plus the pictures looked really nice. Overall I was very pleased ! It was a nice 4 block walk to the Convention Center, the hotel was Clean and the service was Execllent! I loved the breakfast they changed the selection daily. Even better they would bake FRESH COOKIES, and set them out in the evening. Our flight left late in the afternoon and they held our bags for us, which was great since we had a convention still going on that day !We did not use the pool however it looked nice. Our convention pushed for us to stay at the Wyndham since it was only 1 block away. However I do not mind the exercise and this hotel was way more affordable plus and breakfast !!! I am sure I will stay here again.

<Content>Updated and Clean My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in August. The rooms are very nice, and clean. The breakfast was much more than a traditional continental. The parking is free. It's convienent to get to. The outdoor mall was nice but nothing to spend a lot of time at. We went to the movies one night which was convienent. It was too hot to walk to the convention center but on a nice cooler day it would have been doable. The pool was inviting but the air was too warm to be outside for any extended period of time. The staff was very helpful. We would stay here again for sure.

<Content>Great for ballgames We chose this property because of its proximity to Chase Field. In cooler weather the ten minute walk to the ballpark is pleasant, but in the heat of summer it's too bad they don't offer a shuttle service. Other than this small omission, we really enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious and well appointed. Breakfast was typical. Overall, a good value and we would return without question.

<Content>Another great stay at HI Express This hotel was clean, the rooms were large (complete with miocrowave and fridge), and the staff was friendly. Complimentary parking was a plus. The hotel was within walking distance to Chase Field, as well as all the other downtown attractions. It's also conveniently located right off I-10. There are multiple restaurants, bars, gas stations, and fast food places nearby. Once again, I had a lovely experience at a HI Express!

<Content>A Clean Hotel with Value I was in Phoenix for business in April and needed a hotel in this general vicinity. The hotel is in a decent area. The main walking areas are a 5-10 minute walk away.The lobby was very clean and the receptionist was very pleasant and quick. I was checked in and up in my room in a matter of minutes. The room was very clean. It is bright without being obnoxious. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean. All the amenities were working well with the exception of the internet which tended to cut in and out. I did not try out the pool or exercise facilities, but everything I saw was very clean. Obviously it's not a 5-star hotel, but an above average Holiday Inn.

<Content>Great Location - Walk to Downtown I was in Phoenix for a seminar hosted at the Wyndham. The Wyndham wanted almost $200 per night, so I picked the Holiday Inn Express. It turns out that for a 4 day trip, I put less than 8 miles on my rental car. Everything was within walking distance of the hotel. I had dinner each night at the Arizona Center, lunches downtown. It was about a 15 minute walk to the Wyndham and felt very safe. The hotel was clean and comfortable with nice LCD HD television set. I'd stay there again.

<Content>Great Place to stay with kids we recently stayed at this hotel and we weren't expecting much because of the low price. WOW, we were so impressed. The room was spotless and spacious. We had our children with us and they had space to play and we weren't concerned with dirty floors etc. Also, the beds were very comfortable and the bedding was above average. Check in was a breeze and warm cookies were waiting for us at the desk. we had a refrigerator and a microwave. It was an excellent stay....highly recommended.

<Content>Great Choice for Lady Luck. Rooms are clean. They are also comfortable, unless you happen to get one facing the construction site that continues through the night. The complimentary breakfast is better than most, but offers the same choices each day.Finding a parking space in front of hotel can be tricky, and there are only two handicapped parking spaces.Staff made several mistakes before my reservation was correctly booked, but were otherwise courteous and helpful.

<Content>Very convenient to airport We stayed in this hotel on September 24, 2007. The staff was very helpful and check-in was quick. Even though the hotel offers a large continental breakfast in the morning we had to leave early to catch an early flight. The hotel is a short drive to the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport; we didn't have to get on the interstate to get there!

<Content>Construction going on all around this hotel Stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is being upgraded so construction is going on at present. Also, there is so much construction going on around the site that it's not pleasant sitting around the tiny little pool. The pool deck is so small that one subed almost reaches into the water. The room was spacious and clean. It had a microwave and fridge. There are numerous TV channels and it seems to be used a lot by business travellers rather than tourists like us. We visited the Frank Lloyd-Wright house which was indeed worth the trip. We also shopped at Arizona Mills Mall. There is another HIE right beside the Mall and that location would suit toursits better. We also visited the cinema there and ate at Carrabas nearby. The breakfast was pleasant and regularly filled up by staff. We found the location difficult to find as 6th Street is not on a major junction with traffic lights. If you don't know the area you need to look for a right turn from the Interstate. Once we saw the sign we were OK. As a tourist, I wouldn't stay here again as there are better locations.

<Content>Excellent Stay! Great for Families! We are currently here at the Holiday Inn Express! Everyone here is provides high customer service, from the Manager, Kristin, front desk, and the maids. All the employees are courteous and helpful! The rooms are very spacious couch and seperate sleeping areas with two queen beds! The refrigerator, microwave and sink came in handy with children! The pool area is clean and warm! The location is currently undergoing construction! However it is very centrally located to Downtown Phoenix by car. We have friends staying in Tempe and Mesa and it only took us 15 minutes by car to see them! We will definitely stay here again! Thank youLucy from Chicago

<Content>Nice Place. I stayed here on a business trip. Upon check in, the front desk was very helpful in suggesting dinner ideas. It's within walking distance so that was nice. The room was very clean. The breakfast was really nice. Quaint breakfast area. The lobby is really nice. Warm cookies were waiting at the lobby desk upon arrival! USA Today was waiting for me to read during breakfast. I was very happy with this stay.

<Content>Impressed with every detail We are currently staying at this hotel (two rooms, one suite). I'm using their free internet (available in every room) and INCREDIBLY impressed with this hotel. For the price, the rooms are extremely spacious. Amazing clean. The staff is very friendly. We were strangely locked out of our bathroom and they came immediately. The decor in the bathroom is very modern. Washing machines are available. Free cookies in the lobby. Free continental breakfast. The pool outside is comfortable and warm...a perfect place to spend an afternoon. The whirlpool is great (though there seemed to be excess chemicals). The fitness center is a tiny closet (I would definitely suggest running outside instead). The location is within walking distance to all of the quaint shops and delicious restaurants downtown. I would definitely stay here again!
