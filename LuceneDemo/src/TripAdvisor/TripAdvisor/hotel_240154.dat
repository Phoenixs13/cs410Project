<Content>Good place to stay I stayed there for 3 nights over my summer holiday at Berlin. The way to reach hotel was so easy. It was comfortable to go to city and shopping center by undergrounds, trains, buses or by walk. Inside the hotel, room was pretty small and quite. Staffs were friendly, one of them (a guy) spoke English very well. Breakfast served you right at the balcony, looked simple to me--nothing amazing more than just bread and cheese, salami, coffee/tea/juices.

<Content>excellent Joke and Guus Dekking, Netherlands.We stayed her two nights, i.e. february 24 and 25, 2007.Good location, very close to the U5 subway station Samariterstrasse. Quiet at night, clean room. Friendly and helpfull staff. Situated around a huge inner courtyard (plaza) with restaurants. Excellent value for money. Next time we go to Berlin, we will certainly book this hotel again!

<Content>Not bad, some snags Excellent price via their website but a few snags (hence score of 2) which might not be so likely in a small family run hotel, and equally may not worry everyone. E.g. rooms are either overlooking the street or overlooking the quad; street has street noises 24x7, quad had late-night bar noises (till well after midnight while we were there). Hotel aircon is rarely reliable in my experience (ours was broken) which means closing the windows for peace and quiet may not be an option, and rooms on the quad don't get real outside air through the window anyway (the quad is fully enclosed). Beds ridiculously soft (but that seems to be a common problem). Couldn't get the in-house MyCloud WiFi working either, but an Internet station in reception worked fine. Also on the plus side, the quad has a daytime cafe and three restaurants; we enjoyed the cafe, the German, and the Italian restaurant but didn't try the Thai. The location while not central (hence the price?) is convenient for public transport.Summary: may not be the one for you if you enjoy your evening peace and quiet.

<Content>Simply an excellent hotel... My wife and I stayed here for one night in January 2006. We paid 40 euros pre-paid through their website. For that amount of money, you will not find a better hotel in Western Europe. It's located inside a mall on a busy street with plenty of stores and restaurants, a few blocks from the subway. The room itself was incredibly spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. It's easily a 3-star hotel, and the best place we stayed at during our tour of Nice, Berlin, and Sardinia.

<Content>Excellent value I booked through Accor's website and got a deal of 40EUR per night for 4 nights. That was even cheaper than Ibis and Etap.The hotel was in a office building complex, occupying one wing of the quad-shaped complex. The rooms were simple, clean and comfortable.The hotel is not centrally located, but transportation is convenient.

<Content>The best hotel of our trip We stayed at this hotel on November 16, 2005 for 3 nights and it was one of 5 hotel in a trip to Europe and it was the best! Receptionst very helpful, we had a early check in and they help us to keep our bagagge in a meeting room, rooms are quite large and very clean and bathrooms all clean, you can feel safe in there. The breakfast is plenty of all you can wish in the morning, hot meals, fruits, cereal, etc. Also, this hotel is into a place where you can find almost everything you need, ATM, restaurants, coffee, etc, even a good bar where you can hear live music singers and have a good time... I would really recommend this hotel as it is centrally located, close to a metro station Samaritansstrase and it is a very good deal, it worths a lot more than the price you pay for it.

<Content>Mercure Berlin City Ost Hotel We stayed at this Hotel from 23 to 26 August. Excelent services, well sized room, with all you need. Very clean and excelent staff. The hotel is close to metro station (Samaritenstrasse). The hotel is placed into a small comercial centre with well restaurants, ATM's, supermarket, etc. Just in front you can find Restaurant La Palma, an excelent and very cheap italian restaurant. In my next visit to Berlin I will be in this hotel again.

<Content>Very nice hotel on the East Side I received this hotel as a result of a bid on Priceline ($50/night). I was very happy with the quality of this hotel for the bid I made. In fact, I was ecstatic. The hotel was wonderfully clean and located in an area that had everything you might need. Restaurants, bars, ATMs, etc.. The hotel is a five miunute walk from the Frankfurter Allee S- and U-Bahn station in a pretty section of the Friedrichshain area. The hotel is somewhat removed from all of the sights Berlin has to offer, but only a 15 minute subway ride away.
