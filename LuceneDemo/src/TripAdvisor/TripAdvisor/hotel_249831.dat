<Content>The best anniversary at the best place! We came today from a weekend at the Parador Palmas de Luc铆a. Is the best place for a great vacation. All the excellent attention we got and the service was great.The food was the best. We got the All-inclusive package (which, by the way, recommend it), so we didn't worry about nothing. You go to the restaurant, write down the time you want to eat and what you want, you come at that time and give the room number and 5 minutes later... voila! food is at your table. Quality of food is great.You have a room with a small balcony but with a beautiful view. A/C worked great. We had a small glitch with the hot water, but we didn't understand at first, this is a green hotel. It's a solar heater, and the first day it wasn't so hot... but the next two days, it was solved.The pool, albeit small, is was perfect if you want to relax, even enjoy it with your family, The beach near is beautiful.This is a green hotel, so you will se reciclying and reuse tips all over, but it works.Looking forward to come back next year.

<Content>What a rip off Both my wife and I were born in Puerto Rico but have lived in the New York City metro area most of our lives. We have been drawn to the Island over the years and have stayed mostly with family and on occassion at Resort properties. On our most recent visit to the Island, we decided to see and seek lodging on the southernmost part of the Island.On our first 2 nights we stayed in the beautiful Ponce Hilton and were treated like royalty. But then we left to go to the DUMP known as Palmas de Lucia. The beach is full of garbage, and is not attractive at all. The Inn accomodations, staff and food service are also very subpar. During our first night at Parador de Lucia, we were awaken at midnight by a drunken group of people, 3 men and a women who occupied the adjacent room. I made several phone calls to the front desk but no one answered so I looked up in the phone book the number for the police. I don't know if the police ever showed up but the noice subsided around 3 in the morning. In the morning I found out from the front desk clerk that they lock the entrance doors to the Inn at night and the Police would not be able to enter. Great security, but what if you need outside HELP. I then told the clerk that we were leaving because of concerns for our safety but they insisted on billing me for my 3 night reservation. It seems I made the mistake of initialling their check in sheet notifying me that under no circumstances they would credit me for an early check out, in other words (NO REFUNDS). It is three months later and they are still insisting I pay for 3 nights without regard for the horible time we had our first night there. Fromers gave them a decent recommendation and is the reason we made a reservation in the first place but all is not what it seems online. Be very careful and should you make the mistake of booking a room there remember the Police cannot get in to save you. A very disappointed and disgusted Puerto Rican in New York

<Content>Wonderful stay will be back My husband, mother-in-law and I recently stayed at Palmas de Lucia. The check in staff was very friendly we had a wait because the people in front of us had not booked and paid online but when I told the front desk staff we needed to rush because we were closing on a house they expedited our check in. The food was great my mother-in-law hates to eat out but she LOVED the food there. She said the red snapper was the best she had ever eaten! I am vegetarian and they had no problems accommodating my diet (the marinara sauce was excellent). Ozmin and Ramon were excellent waiters!!! The rooms were clean a few ants were seen at times but nothing to complain about. All rooms have a TV and a refrigerator. The pool was very clean. Also being in the health profession I found it very impressive the hotel has an AED!!The beach is down the road it has sea grass and not maintained by the hotel. The water was rough while we were there but it was still beautiful to look at. Great place to relax and reflect.The only complaint we had was the bar down the road plays the music REALLY loud on the weekend (it is against the law to play music during the week). (They do make great drinks.) My husband and I just drowned the music out with the TV but my mother-in-law had a rough time with the loud music. Next time we will request rooms down the hall. If you are looking for a 5 star hotel this hotel is not for you! If you are looking for off the beaten path were you can spend time with native Puerto Ricans, and enjoy the ocean then this is the place for you. It is best to rent a car to travel to the Bacardi tour, to the rainforest and/or any other great spots in PR . Before you go on an excursion stop by the stores along the road by the hotel. They do speak English and carry ice chests, ice, drinks, snacks, etc. The Puerto Rican people at the stores were very welcoming.We chose this hotel because we were in Puerto Rico to purchase a house. We wanted to save money but also wanted to be close to our house ; the Palmas de Lucia was the PERFECT spot. Since the Palmas is close to our new house if our house is not finished when we return to PR we will definitely stay at the Palmas de Lucia if our house is fixed we will definitely be back for meals and to visit the GREAT STAFF.

<Content>Terrible Parador Experience DO NOT GO HERE. You will be disappointed.  I have heard great things about other Paradores, but this one is an exception. They have a nice website on which they advertise their proximity to the beach and exquisite restaurant menu, among other things.  The public beach next to the property is 100 feet away as advertised, but they left out the fact that is full of garbage and inhabited by stray dogs (one of which I saw lying dead in the surf, and it looked like it had been there a while). I have never been so disgusted by a beach before in my life; not what one looks for on vacation. The restaurant was a similarly terrible experience. The service was slow and confused, and the food was even worse. $15+ USD for reheated steak and frozen vegetables. Enough said. In all fairness the room was clean and comfortable, but considering the other factors, not at all worth what they charge.  I would not even recommend visiting this area of the island. All of the beaches seemed to be severely neglected and there is an oil refinery 10 minutes up the highway.

<Content>wished I could say the stay was nice Well to continue a bad trip after a credit card was lost on vacation my wife and I tried to make the best of a bad situation. So we decided to go to the hotel...... what a mistake we were told to wait for the manager who was eating lunch. so we waited..... and waited....... and waited I wish I could tell you her name but she never came out. ohh it was after 1:30 when we arrived. We explained our situation to the hostess and had our bank on the line in order to authorize the sale and were promptly told no. We both had identification and our passports and were told We can't tell if it it's really you yes because Identity thieves carry 3 forms of ID that include their social security cards. All in all after being treated like a criminal you couldn't pay me enough to stay at this hotel or any other under the same management. So they gave us the best anniversary gift they could.... WOW!!! Really you shouldn't have!

<Content>no real complaints We spent two nights at the Palmas de lucia and found it comfortable and clean. It had a nice pool and a work out room. The resturant is okay, alittle pricey.  If visiting family or friends its a great place to stay for the money. Would not recommend it as vacation destination. There is little to do in the area. Also the surrounding areas are very depressed.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprized We just returned from a week at Parador Palmas De Lucia, and we were completely satisfied with our stay. Everything 鈥?our room, the hallways, and the public areas were immaculately clean. Maid service was daily and efficient. The towels were full size, fluffy and replaced daily. Our room came with a coffee pot, microwave and small fridge. The food was good, and the service in the dining room outstanding. We had a problem with our patio door, and within minutes of reporting it, the owner himself arrived with a screw driver and fixed it. The pool wasn鈥檛 huge, but it was more than adequate and like everything else, scrupulously cared for and clean. The entire staff was friendly, helpful and welcoming. While the immediate area doesn鈥檛 offer much 鈥渢ourist鈥?stuff, the location is perfect for those who have a car and want to travel the south coast and east coast. The only disappointment was the beach. It鈥檚 public 鈥?not owned by the hotel - and is a weekend hang out for local young people who don鈥檛 care about the trash they leave. This is not your average tourist hotel 鈥?there were days when I am pretty sure that we were the only 鈥淣orte-Americano鈥檚 in residence. But if you are seeking a taste of the real Puerto Rico, then I can highly recommend it. We will definitely go back. I have paid a lot more for a lot less.

<Content>My honest opinion... We stayed at Palmas de Lucia on the weekend of Sept 29th-Oct 1st. I have to say that I have mixed feelings about this place. Check in was quick and the lady at the front desk was very nice. Small pool, but my nieces and nephews did not seem to mind, they had a great time at the pool. The area around the pool was nice, but outside the hotel is kind of dirty and the beach is no a good one for swimming. I found a broken beer bottle on the sand. The rooms were ok, nothing fancy, with a little fridge and microwave, and the beds were comfortable. But it was very humid inside the room! The bathroom was another story. Very bad design, and no air vents. Had a hard time to get warm water, it was like extremely cold or extremely hot. After a while trying, we got warm water. The outlet was broken, so I could not plug my hair dryer. Apparently this is an ongoing problem, since another room in our party had the same problem. And the room smelled musty. The room had a balcony looking to the pool. My husband and father in law had breakfast at the restaurant, and they were not happy. They said it was not good at all. We went on sunday to a nearby bakery and bought bread, ham and cheese and had breakfast. We did not use the restaurant for dinner, since we were there for a wedding in nearby Humacao, so we ate there, and I'm glad it was that way. Also the room doors and the frame are metal, so every time you close the door, it slams. Slams so hard that I could hear it from far away. A little annoying. I'm not a picky person, the only thing I ask for is a room in working order.I do not think I will stay again....

<Content>Disappointing We recently spent one night at the Parador Palmas de Lucia (on the southeast corner of Puerto Rico) and were disappointed. The hotel is near the beach, but not on it. There is a small building between the hotel and the beach, which blocks the view. Maybe there is a better view of the ocean from the second floor rooms, but from our first floor room, we only had a peak.The building has seen better days. The doors to the interior corridor all looked in really bad shape. We thought from the description of the place that it was new, so were disappointed.All in all, if we had to do it over again, we would not choose that hotel nor that location. We did pass another hotel nearby, up on a hill, overlooking the ocean. If for some reason we wanted to stay near there again, I would try to find the name of the other hotel.

<Content>hidden jewel after spending three nights in noisy and busy san juan, we found this hotel...what a pleasant change...just what we wanted...long sandy beaches with lots of coconut palms....the staff were friendly and helpful and really made you feel welcome...rooms were clean and spacious...this is not for those who want to be waited on hand and foot....but for $90 a night including taxes this is truly a good value....family run and it shows.....

<Content>Ahhh....so relaxing Stayed 03-07 Feb 05, great getaway for couples w/o children. Hidden away on the lower east coast w/ great calendar like scenery. On site restaurant w/ good variety of local cousine. Very lay back staff, so go w/ relaxation in mind and deal with slow but great service. Rooms have necessary amenities, no frills. Nicely manicured garden, open pool, and near by public beach (no services). Shorth drive to larger serviced beach. Hotel has an all-inclusive  ala carte mode for the restaurant; we took the ala carte and has an expanded menu, did great. We would defitnetly return as long we stay childless. During weekdays we had the hotel to ourselves as the local influx departed on Sunday for the workweek, the stargazing was out of this world. Again, think relaxation, low draw...if unable to cope Palmas del Mar is 15 minutes away @ $300/day.

<Content>Loved It! Very good service. My husband and I stayed at Palmas de Lucia four days on January 2005. We requested a deluxe room package with all-inclusive. The room was nicely equipped, microwave,refrigerator, king bed, cofee maker with compliment coffe ,Cable TV etc... The package was for three days and 2 nights and we requested an extra night because the service was excellent. The hotel is only two minutes from the Toll Highway and aproximately 7-10 minutes from Humacao City which has a huge shopping mall with cinema theaters and lots of restaurants. The only thing we didn't like about the hotel was the beach. It was very dirty, lots of crabs and it was not swimmable. Everything else was lovely fo the price.

<Content>Charming Paradores I have fond memories of this area from visiting Yabucoa as a child. I stayed here in April of 2004 with my 6 yr old son at Palmas de Lucia for 8 nights and enjoyed the facilities, warm and welcoming staff, and cleanliness of the rooms. All of the staff was bi-lingual which very helpful. My son enjoyed the game room, basketball court and pool. This truly could be considered a family resort. The beach adjacent to this property should be for walking and sunbathing only as the currents and riptides are dangerous, it is nonetheless very picturesque, soothing and a relaxing place to vist. The only recommendation or drawback when traveling with children here is that the menu for the restaurant is somewhat limited for a childrens menu. If you have a rental car there are supermarkets and other Americanized restaurants close by to get you over that challenge! This was a memorable trip for my son and myself!

<Content>Dirty Beach :o( Mu husband and I stayed at this parador for 4 nights and we were totally wrong picking this place. Very very dirty beach - it is not swimable and you cannot lay down or walk on it. Food was OK (we didn't have any other choices), and one of the waiters was so mean, when we came in around 8.30 pm - he said they would be closed at 9 pm and we supposed to come in earlier !!!!! We're so regret that we stayed in this parador.

<Content>Nice Place to Stay My wife and I spent one night here (paid $105, includes tax) and very much enjoyed it. We had a roomy second-story room that was nicely furnished and air-conditioned. The room was very clean, although me noticed a few very tiny ants in the bathroom. The parador has a very nice staff. There is a nice swimming pool and landscaped courtyard. It is only a very short walk to Lucia Beach. We ate at the on-site restaurant. I had the grilled red snapper, and it was outstanding. Very nice wait staff at the restaurant.

<Content>Low rates - but watch out.... Hotel rooms were fine and pretty quiet. Stayed three days - on the last day when I looked for my Nautica jacket I left in the closet -it was not in the room (unfortunately for me my wallet was in this jacket as well). Moral of this story - do not keep anything of value in the hotel rooms at this hotel since the cinchy key locks to the room or room service is not trustworthy. Fortunately I was able to cancel all my cards upon arriving back in the states that evening - only hit with a 10.00 gas bill on one of the cards before more charges had racked up.
