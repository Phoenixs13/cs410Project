<Content>Hot  Positive: Clean, good security, great location, surrounded by numerous good restaurants, Negative: do not rely on receiving wake-up calls, shower will alternately skald  freeze you each time anyone on your floor flushes a toilet, subscribes to TV cable with only Spanish speaking stations, rooms are extremely small, 2 elevators hold only two/three people each per trip which is normally not a problem but this hotel caters to groups and between the wait in line on each floor and the time to get from the ninth floor to the lobby can be a 20 minute trip when the groups are all coming down to catch a bus at the same time or a 30 minute wait to get back to your room if you were at the back of the incoming bus.

<Content>We enjoyed our stay!! We stayed at the Hotel Florencia for three night in May, 2006. Our only regret was that it wasn't longer. The breakfast buffet was good, the rooms were nice and clean and the staff was very accomodating, easpecially the head bellman. The area has a lot of great shopping, both high class and artesianal. Antique stores and great restaurants are everywhere. We really enjoyed the seafood restaurant The Los Arcos, which is within walking distance of the hotel. If you take a taxi take a regular taxi (not a green volkswagon) instead of one of the hotel taxis because the hotel taxis will cost you about three times more.We will stay in this hotel again as it was one of the best medium priced hotels that we have found in Latin America.
