<Content>Do not waste your time or money Got fool by the web site pictures. live and learn, never again book one of these small hotels thru the web.Anyway we have 4 kids with us from 25 to 13 yrs traveling around PR and learnig about this beautiful island have to offer. When we got to The Cofresi Beach Club Hotel our kids said to us that they feel weird and uncomfortable in the room. The hotel was empty and we (my wife and I) went downstairs, after driving for 4 hrs ,and explained the situation with the kids to the manager and to ask for a refund. They refused and we decided not to pursue and left. The rooms were old and not kept up, we went to see the roof pool and laughed, our bath tub is the same size , that was the best joke of the day.Anyway if your are really drunk and prefer to sleep someplace else than the street call them.

<Content>Great Place to stay!!!! Great place to stay. Clean and comfortable. Great pricing for the off season. The staff was extra friendly. Couldn't ask for better. Right down the street from the poblado (village) of Boqueron. What an amazing place. Everyone is friendly and Sundays nights are the best down there. The hotel is convienent to everywhere in Puerto Rico with the small town atmosphere. LOVE IT will stay there again.

<Content>would stay there agian Hotel exceeded my expectations. The rooms were very clean comfortable. Kitchens in the suits were well equipped and staff service was great. Had booked a two bedroom unit and was upgraded to a three on arrival!! Loved how there were two bathrooms and the balcony was nice for drying bathing suits. I have stayed at a number of places in Puerto Rico and this hotel gives you the most bang for your buck. I would highly recommend this hotel to singles and families alike! Should mention the hotel is not geared for people looking to spend a lot of time there,. The pool is nothing to get excited over and there is not a real common area to be in.

<Content>Did not like the stay My family (all adults) and I stayed at this hotel for 5 days. It is a small 3 bedroom apartment-hotel. Seemed clean, but the inside of the closet slats were dusty as well as the ceiling fans. We were sneezing, and woke up with stuffy nose every single day. Furniture and bathroom need some updating and could see the wear and tear.Kitchen is equipped, but did not use any of the utensils/ dinnerware. Glasses were dirty. The key to turn on the A/C is in the same key chain as the entrance door and the electronic gate opener. If you leave the apartment you are forced to turn the AC off. The key will not come off unless you turn it off. All keys are in the same key chain and cannot come off, the chain is welded so the keys will not come off. A hassle as we were in 2 cars and going separate ways, coming and going at different times. Some vertical blinds cannot open, chain broken. Others can be slided to the side but not completly. Parking lot is about 5 houses down the street, has an electronic gate. Office personnel were very nice.
