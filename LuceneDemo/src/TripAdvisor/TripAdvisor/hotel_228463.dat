<Content>A good experience We booked the hotel at a great rate, probably because of the building work going on at the one side of the hotel. The hotel itself was very well presented and attractive. It is very modern, but the art work on display makes it interesting to look around. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. However do be careful if booking taxis through them. We took a taxi up town and were charged almost 19 euros. We were amazed when we took the return journey and it cost less than six!!! Check the rate when you are picked up- the meter should be on about 2 euros at pick-up or you are about to be ripped off. As with all the hotels breakfast is expensive, so take a short walk to the left and eat at one of the perfectly fine small cafes for half the price and less. Mar Bella beach is a short stroll across the dual carriageway, you wont need a swim suit! We have been in the sea in December twice here- it is bracing but a great experience. The tube is about a 10 minute walk away. The room was modern and bright with a really nice bathroom. The only negative was the building work outside our window, but they can't help that and the rate reflected it. I would be very happy to stay there again.

<Content>Excellent hotel Just came back from two nights at this hotel. The hotel itself is excellent. Cannot complain at all about the staff, facilities, rooms, cleanliness etc.The location was great for my wife and I. Literally 2 minutes (across the road) from the beach. A very pleasant walk along the sea front towards the centre of the city took about 30 minutes.If you're not into walking far the Poblenou Metro station is about 7 minutes walk 3 blocks away.The only thing I would make people aware of is that if your room looks out onto the Carrer de Lope de Vega (the main street the hotel is located on), then there is some major building work going on in the plot across the road. We were woken both mornings around 8am by pneumatic drills, lorries reversing, banging etc.We visited from 20-22 October 2008, and the building work was in its very early stages, so I presume it will continue for many months. As we are both early-risers the noise didn't bother us though, and maybe you can request a room not on that side of the hotel.We would definitely go back to this hotel again, and it suited us great.

<Content>AWESOME!!! For a 2 star hotel This hotel in Barcelona is awesome! The rooms are very modern, even hard wood floors. Bathrooms are very spacious, plenty of hot water. It is in front of the beach. To go to the metro is 4 blocks away. Safe and quiet area. Breakfast includes eggs, ham, bacon, pastries, fruit and yogurt. After staying in this hotel my expectations for other 2 star were raised.

<Content>Good Value, Nice Hotel near beach Just stayed 3 nights for 75 euro/night including breakfast. Plus tax of 1.07% came to roughly 82 euros. Very nice hotel, clean, no issues. We stayed on the 5th floor, so it was quiet. We had what looked like a handicap accessible room, but it wasn't a problem. It was right across from a great beach and we quickly figured out the transportation into town. The yellow line or the 41 bus. Our only nit was that the hotel charged us 3 euros per beach towel to use. That was in our opinion in poor taste. Taxi back to airport was 35 euro, but it is what it is to get a beach location. Considering that hostels with private bath go between 60 and 80 euros, it was well work it. GIven that the dollar exchange rate absolutely sucks, a 75 euro nice beach front hotel was appreciated.

<Content>loved rooms but not walking distance we stayed in hotel for 4 nights with my husband.Infact we like the hotel in terms of price(75 euro/per night), clean rooms, good air condition, safety. But hotel is a little far away from city. 2 ways to reach barcelona city center. 1-by metro from poblenou (10 min walking) 2-no:41 bus (2 min walking but not often (in 15 min time it's coming)

<Content>good hotel This hotel is very nice, the rooms are spacious and very comfortable, and the hotel staff is friendly too. The hotel location is quite far (20 min. walk) from center (the Ramblas), but it is very close to the beach (5 min. walk).If you're traveling by car, it is very easy to find a free parking spot just 10/20 meters from the hotel main entrance.I would recommend this hotel for people looking for a safe and quite area of Barcelona.

<Content>Excellent service I have just had 4 nights at the hotel. Very good, clean and adequate accommodation. The buffet hot  cold breakfast is well worth the 13.50 euros which cater for lots of tastes. We had late night snacks on the terrace at reasonable prices. The receptionists are very helpful and the Food  Beverage Manager Ricardo placed a bottle of Bubbly in my room for my 50th birthday. Just 10 mins walk north of the hotel is Diagional mar a large shopping arcade and lots of eating outlets, just besides the forum.The best way to travel about is by taking the No 41 bus from almost outside the hotel into the center of Barcelona 1.25 Euros. Purchase a Bus Turistic pass 1 day = 19 or 2 day = 23 Euros - you can hop on and off all day seeing all the sights over 3 tours - well worth the money.If your in Barcelona for more than 2 days take a trip down to Sitges 30mins by train south 5 Euros from the main train station. A lovely fishing village with great beaches and good restaurants/bars. OH! use taxi's they are dirt cheap before 12pm airport to hotel 20 Euro, 8 euro from the town center to hotel. I can recommend the hotel - very good

<Content>Quiet, Clean! Good value for the money. Short walk to underground. Very short walk to beach. Pleasant walk along beach to beach restaurants. This isn't the neighborhood you'll want to hang out in - kind of dead but safe. May be due to residents were gone on Easter week. Room clean and quiet. Nice staff.

<Content>Nice Hotel The hotel is nice but a bit far away from the centre. There is a good 10-12 min walk from the Metro stop Poblenou.We also tried once using the bus from Placa Catalunya. The rooms are nice with a stacked mini bar.The breakfast is average.

<Content>Rafaelhoteles worth it We got a good deal on the rate, compared to other prices given by tourist-central hotels.Very nice, comfortable rooms especially for European standard.The location is not the greatest -- Four blocks away from the Poblenou metro stop and in a rather rundown residential area, but it's close to the beach! (Just have to cross a busy road and you're there!)Awesome breakfast, but expensive! The chocolate chip muffins were by far the tastiest!

<Content>Quiet  My girlfriend and I stayed here for 8 days while we explored Barcelona. The hotel is safe and quiet, and the staff are friendly and very helpful. I loved our stay here.The nearest metro to Rafaelhoteles Diagonal is Poublenou, a good 10-minute walk. It looks like a sketchy area, but it's really not. The long walk to the metro allowed us to discover things you'll never find in a tourist book. We stopped in the local diners for breakfast, shopped at the little groceries, and we even found a hometown pizza place we ate at a couple of times. The hotel might be a little distance from downtown, but we were far more interested in getting to know the people and the city, rather than clubbing or late night drinking. The locals are very friendly, and it's just a cozy area all around. A nice change of atmosphere after a long day of crowded touristy places and loud drinkers in the city! A cab to the hotel from the airport was about 28 euros, more or less depending on number of bags.

<Content>The perfect Base The perfect base for a Barcelona experience trip! Ask for Anna Fischbach at the reception desk. She gives you the information to find the right places without wasting time. Me and my son had a great extented weekend and we will be back soon.P.S. Make the water temperature fixable in the shower, please.

<Content>Very nice hotel I stayed with my friend in this hotel which I already new was good since I stayed in the same chain once in Madrid. It is a very nice place indeed, very nice spotless clean rooms (You can not find cleaner), nice soft sheets, excellent air conditioning system which could make the room freezing in the hot weather of barcelona which is kind of unbearable in the summer time, (over 30 degrees). Only inconvenient was that it is not very central, and the views are not very nice, but I found the location still good since it is quiet and not as noisy and unbearable as the city centre, and besides, the very good underground takes you to the city within 15 minutes and a taxi journey does not cost 10 euro. The hotel also provide nice toileteries and they can even give toothbrush in case you forget yours. You can also rent towels for the beach for a very little price (1.50 euro). Staff is friendly and managed to speak French and English quite decently. Rooms are nice and bright, shower is great and the hotel is less than 100 m from a very nice sand beach. I highly recommand this place for everybody who wants to enjoy a great quality service and a very nice hotel,at an very affordable price (I paid 65 euro double without breakfast). Forget to tell that the decoration was very nice, and that they offer a short time internet connection free of charge.

<Content>Really friendly and Smart Hotel I booked this Hotel using expedia and was a little worried by some reviewers comments on it's location. However we were very pleased with the hotel and after walking around Barcelona city centre we were glad of a bit of peace and quiet! - The staff in the bar were very friendly and although the counter is not always manned they have a notice asking you to contact reception for service. The rooms were very clean. Breakfast is buffet style and should have something to suit anyone.

<Content>Good hotel, slow service! Stayed at this hotel during April 2004. Really nice hotel, rooms were clean, modern and spacious. A bit far to walk into the centre of Barcelona every day (30-45 walk) for me, but taxi's were relatively cheap in the day - book early in the night though.Only downer with the hotel, was the slow service in the bar. On our first night in Barcelona we ended up staying at the hotel and having a few drinks as one of our group was ill. We ended up having to go out and find a bar in frustration as it was taking us over half an hour to order a new round.....and we were the only people in the bar!!!Having said that, I must recommend the shabby Bar Musical on the same street (lopa de vega?) owned by Antonio, a fab and funny Spanish guy who will keep your glasses full all night!!!

<Content>Nice view, but far away from the city center We were at Rafael Diagonal for a long weekend in March. The rooms are all nice but some have as a view a empty field full of construction equipment ( the area is under development). We got a suite and that had a nice sea-view. The sea is at less than 100m away and on the beach side you have some local tavernas with good sea food and good priced paellas-this is in fact your only possibility to get some decent food in the area.Otherwise you have to go to the center of Barcelona which is pretty far from the hotel.One should always get the bus (at some 50m from the hotel) or go to the metro station at 10 min walk.The journey to the city center can last up to 25 min with the bus and one can have a hard time to find a bus to go back from city center to the hotel after 10 pm.The rooms are very clean-some equipped with jacuzzi- and you get new amenities every day. There is a coffe-tea possibility in the suites. We did not try the breakfast nor the restaurant in the hotel but prices seemed reasonable. The staff is very friendly and try to do their best with English. In total we got a very positive impression from the hotel but when you have walked around in Barcelona for 10 hours then you realise that it is located really far away from the center.

<Content>Excellent quality of service I had a three night stay in Barcelona for which I booked into the Rafaelhoteles Diagonal Port. I had done some research beforehand in order to ensure I got a good quality hotel at a price I could aford. I was not let down, the service was excellent and the hotel very stylishly furnished.After check-in I immediately took a walk along the sea front to La Rambla (main shopping centre). This took about 45 minutes which I didn't mind as the weather was fine and the views beautiful. Subsequently, I always used the metro station situated about 5 mins walk from the hotel.Taxis to and from the airport will cost around 20 euros. Taxis from the centre of town will around 10 Euros.The hotel supplies stuff like shower gel, soap etc and even supplies a toothbrush in case you've forgotten yours!There is a safe in every room which is free and allows you to set your own combination.The rooms are cleaned every day and are maintained to a very high standard (even I was more than satisfied!).In short, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who requires good quality of service, does not mind a hotel on the outskirts of the city centre but extremely well priced.

<Content>A Must for Cat Lovers! My husband and I recently visited Barcelona along with a couple of friends.It's always a gamble booking a hotel online despite the various sites offering reviews. However, this one exceeded my expectations.If it has a downside, it is only its location. The whole of this area is being redeveloped and at present, there is a lack of restaurants within walking distance. The buses, however, are frequent and cheap taking you to the Rambla.However, the rest of my review is solid praise.The rooms are spotlessly clean, light and airy. The marble bathrooms are lovely. The dinner was excellent and reasonably priced. Great selection of everything at buffet breakfast. The staff in both the bar, restaurant and at the front desk could not have been more helpful.We even had the pleasure of watching the antics of a family of feral cats from our bedroom window! Great for cat lovers!!I recommend this hotel without reservation!

<Content>A good hotel choice Rafael Diagonal Port is a good choice for a resonably priced hotel in Barcelona. The hotel is modern and clean but does not have any local charm. The hotel is conveniently located to major attractions and transportation. It is about a block from the beach and we had a lovely view from our hotel windows.We were a group of 15 people who traveled together to Spain and stayed at this hotel. Everyone in our group was pleased with this hotel.
