<Content>Above average Room had full kitchen and hotel had FREE guest laundry with 4 machines. No breakfast. Paid $125 for Sunday night with AAA. Front desk seemed understaffed. About a one mile walk to the Galleria and a few other restaurants. We wound up at Paradise Cafe. Soups, salads, sandwiches. Hotel is freeway close. This worked well for our one night in Dallas.

<Content>Good place to stay. I am actually still staying here, and I can tell you that since the latest reviews on THIS site, they have changed a lot. New beds (VERY comfortable), high speed internet, recliner, DVD player, CD player, fitness center, and pretty big closet space for a hotel.My only negative comment is : The shower pressure is... odd. It's high enough to be comfy, but I think I'm just picky about my shower. Hot water!Very quiet! In a good location.

<Content>Trouble place I got the hotel thru hotwire usually when i reserve with them the rating was pretty good. This time they missed it. They give candlewood hotel 2.5 but it is a 1 star hotel. Dirty room, leaky air condition and restroom fan is not function. I asked to chage to another room they said i have to wait 4 hours. I paid the full amount and i do not have any choice to finish the remainder of my two days stay here. I alredy have staffy nose and headache. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL PERIOD.

<Content>Not to my liking I stayed here three days during a business trip. It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible.They offer full kitchen facilities in each room. However, they only offer housekeeping services on a weekly basis. If you wanted clean towels or sheets, you would have to exchange them at the front desk.They offered snack items on the honor system in their room they called the Candlewood Cupboard. They weren't too expensive, but I usually went to the CSV next door because there was a better selection.If given a choice, I would not stay here again unless it was a last resort. It was better than a motel, but not as nice as even a Holiday Inn.

<Content>Wonderful! Serves the purpose perfectly Wonderful experience! Serves the purpose extremely well! Rooms are spacious, amenities are great. Has a lovely kitchenette in case you plan to make or bring in food into the room. Service is prompt and courteous, has a pretty cool fitness center and a Convenience Center that works in the Honor System. Free Video rentals are available at the front desk. Laundry facilities are good, business center albeit small is sufficient. Location by the Galleria is awesome! Has a neat little barbeque place by the side.The only thing the hotel lacks is a spacious decorated lobby that the 5 star hotels boast of; but do you really care?It was great value for my 40 bucks!
