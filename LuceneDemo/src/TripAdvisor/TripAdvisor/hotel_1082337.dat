<Content>Nice clean hotel in a quiet area Staff were very polite and helpful. The room was very clean. Hotel is close to the U-Bahn and a nice Tapas bar, but apart from that there is very little around the area other than office buildings (so no final bars or late night snacks when you return to the area). Breakfast was nice enough and reasonable value at 鈧?.We stayed in the other section, so we had to go through the breakfast area and then turn right into another building before using the lift/stairs. I got used to it, but I imagine older guests might not want to go through so many heavy doors to get to and from their room. Negative points are, the beds were fairly narrow, a wider bed would have been more comfortable and the hotel should offer some light snacks (e.g. sandwiches) since there's nowhere in the area to eat late.If you want a nice, reasonably priced, clean hotel in a quiet area that's still connected to the transport system, then I would recommend this one. If you want to be in the thick of the bar action then look for places in Nord Mitte or Prenzlauer Berg.

<Content>A Work In Progress This hotel is located in a nice area of berlin near the ubahn station of spittelmarkt.it was clean, the rooms are a bit small but suitable for a city break. However when myself and two friends booked what was advertised on their website ( namely two double rooms with connecting door) on arrival we found that this was not the case, in fact they did not have this type of accommodation at all despite having written confirmation to the contrary. After a couple of hours deliberation we were finally accommodated. this hotel opened in my opinion too early and was not ready to receive guests. The breakfast area is located two sides of a passway in the lower basement of the hotel. found this a bit claustophobic. Reception staff do not comnmunicate with each other when trying to solve a problem that did arise when we stayed there. with time and effort this could improve and maybe this hotel will rise in its rating.
