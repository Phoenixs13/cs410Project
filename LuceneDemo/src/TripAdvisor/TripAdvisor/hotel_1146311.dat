<Content>brief but lasting The hotel concept and location is for people spending a few hours in Amsterdam Airport (Schipol), but after reaching my destination I count the stay in Yotel as a pleasent and memorable. The booking is done through an automated machines (similar to ATMs), the room is a cubicle with everything available within hand reach. I stayed for 4 hours during which surfed the net (free wireless connection), took a hot bath (so pack some change clothes with you on the plane), wathced some TV, took a good nap and had my wake-up call from the recetion desk on time. the stay gave me a good jump start for my connection. Also everything is available within a few steps like McDonnald, Flower shop, gift shop, Sushi place,.......So, if you have these few hours in Schipol go ahead and YOTEL.
