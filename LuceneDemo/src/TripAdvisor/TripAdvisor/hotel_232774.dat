<Content>Great location. Not as clean as one might want. Not associated with the Ritz Carlton in any way shape or form, something that becomes evident upon arrival, but has a great central location in Barcelona. Room service lacked basic foodstuffs, like bread and ham. We found a dirty condom under the bed, left by a previous occupant, which we discovered while looking for our 3 year old's shoe. Management offered to send a maid to clean the room again, nothing else. Nice bathroom, decent size TV, cute little terrace. Pretty small room. Very thin walls. Good amenities, plenty of towels. Terrible, super-hard mattresses. One of the least comfortable nights I have ever spent anywhere -- and I slept in Grand Central Station once in the 80s. Did I mention the dirty condom under the bed?

<Content>Not too bad The hotel is quite okay. The staff is friendly enough but seems a bit laid back. Communicating in english is a little difficult. THe room is fine. Clean and spacious. The location is about 5-10 min walk from the nearest metro. It's about 15 min walk to the La Rambla. All in all, I was quite happy with the hotel

<Content>Good hotel in excellent central location This hotel is two blocks from the Plaza Catalunya at the beginning of the Las Ramblas, the most popular pedestrian way in Barcelona which leads to the Gothic quarter and the Port. I would suggest eating at one of the nearby cafes or restaurants. The hotel is well maintained and stylish and its staff is well mannered and helpful. Barcelona is a very beautiful city. Enjoy!I would actually rate this hotel 3.5 stars out of 5.John and Judy from Boston

<Content>Loved it!!! lovely hotel, massive room with balcony. staff were lovely very helpful and put up with our groups drunken antics! very central location - walked everywhere. top of the road is the famous Gaudi House and just down a bit was Gaudi Apartments. Didn't have breakfast - but found very good cafe round the corner - Tapas Gaudi which sereved bacon / eggs / toast / coffee and orange juice for 鈧?. Would highly recommend to anyone going to Barcelona - which is a fab city!! Will def be going back.

<Content>Ritz in name only Reviewer Manchester EnglandJust spent two days in Barcelona with the family at the Ritz Roger de Lluria hotel. Not impressed at all. Let me start by saying that the location is in fact excellent, and the rooms of a reasonable standard for the price, if somewhat lack lustered.But the staff (other than an excellent Italian concierge) were completely useless. Surly, lacking any idea how to run a front desk with a complete lack of working English. I can understand this from a small hotel off the beaten track, but not a so called 4 star in the centre of a major European city. Just to give you one instance, we have a party of six, over 11 pieces of luggage, which we had to man handle in the lifts ourselves because the porter forgot to callFront desk said he was busy, but porter said that he just forgot !!!!When he finally arrived he failed to get us the taxis we required, leaving us to wonder in the street searching in the rain.Breakfast was the only meal we took, poor and lacking variety. If you wanted hot tea, you had to make it your self, pouring out hot water from a communal hot jug.There are much better hotels, at a similar cost to stay at in Barcelona than this one. Avoid it !!!!!!!

<Content>Beautiful hotel with the best Barcelona location Beautiful decor, great service and an unbeatable location in Barcelona. I have been to this city plenty of times, and this is one of the nicest places to stay. The Ritz is a great value compared to the Palace next door.

<Content>Don't bother Positive:1) Central Location2) Large rooms by European standardsNegative:1) A little rundown2) Ridiculous telephone prices3) Arrogant, unfriendly receptionAs a business traveller, I see a lot of hotels - good and poor. Check-In was ok, but ist was the first time, that I got a room, that wasn't made. Got a new one, no problem. Rooms are old and a bit rundown; not too clean. Breakfast was good except for rancid raw ham and salami and constant asking of staff for room number (they didn't do much else). Unpleasant check-out: While talking to me the manager on duty was also on the, very unfriendly. The mini-bar rates charged me on the bill where higher than on the list in the room. What really surprised me was the cost of a 3-minute local call: more than five Euro for two units. For me that's clearly rip-off. In total, I CANNOT recommend this hotel.

<Content>great location we have just returned from the ritz roger barcelona,enjoyed every minute of it ,the hotel as it says a four star,,beautiful decor, marble and spotlessly clean, courteous staff very helpful ,fantastic location just a few blocks off the ramblas and catalunya square, we went july and it was very busy ,very hot and humid, we went by metro to go stiges another resort about half hour journey which is very nice and clean but not as busy,lovely shops,the hotel rooms have air con but you need to tell them if it is not cool enough and they will adjust it for you, buffet breakfast was average,there was eggs,bacon ,cheese,hams ,yoghurts ,toast,rolls , pastries,drinks ,fruit, ,the bathrooms even have toothbrushes,razors,tgoothpaste just incase you forget them.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Central Location This hotel was in an excellent location about a 10-15min walk from Passeig de Gracia/ La Ramblas (The two central streets of downtown Barcelona). The hotel itself was well maintained and had a nice decor. The reception staff were very helpful and courteous which made our stay even more enjoyable. The rooms were of a good size and had a well stocked bathroom even complete with bathrobes. The only let down was the buffet breakfast. It was of a poor standard, not much variety and the buffet was constantly running out of food which was quickly replaced when the staff were alerted. All in all a great place to stay but don't bother with the breakfast.

<Content>Old - I Hated It...But Wife Loved It I have to give the Hotel Ritz Barcelona (no affiliation with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel chain) a neutral rating because my wife loved it...and I hated it.It's old. Yes, as the previous reviewer wrote, it is in a great location...because it's old. If you like Old Europe feel, then this is the place for you. I like new and modern, so -- when we had lunch at the Ritz Carlton's Hotel Arts -- I knew that we had made a mistake. (Hotel Arts is gorgeous, by the way. Even my wife acknowledged that it was beautiful.)Our room at the Hotel Ritz was old. I just hated it.The concierge staff was good. They recommended dinner at a particular restaurant (I don't have the name in front of me right now) that both my wife and I enjoyed very much. We appreciated that recommendation. Breakfast at Hotel Ritz was pretty average. Not great...but not bad.My wife would stay here again...but I won't. :)

<Content>Great centrally located hotel Stayed at this hotel for three nights from 2/Sept/5  had a great time. Staff are very friendly and efficient.Hotel is of a very good standard. The room was huge, well furnished and very clean.However, as our room was on the first floor at the front of the hotel the noise from the busy street below is a little annoying during the rush hour periods.
