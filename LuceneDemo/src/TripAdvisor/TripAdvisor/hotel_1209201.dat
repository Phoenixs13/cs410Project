<Content>Get a chocolate with your coffee! My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in December 2008. Check in is in the bar-cafe downstairs and then you go out and round to the courtyard and up stairs ( no elevator!) - we were on the 2nd floor(52 steps and yes I counted them) and though not really a problem, it would be difficult for some people. The rooms are interesting, spacious and clean, although not luxurious, but the bathroom was very clean and modern with a super shower. Because the rooms are at the back and face onto the courtyard it is blissfully quiet at night - Mehringdamm is quite a busy street but we couldn't hear the traffic at all.The buffet breakfast is served in the bar and is good and very generous - the items offered on Christmas morning were unusual to say the least! zB Wurst und Kartoffelsalat.The disadvantage, I would say, is that, apart from the bar downstairs which by the way is a lovely place to have a snack-lunch or a late-night drink, there is no residents' lounge as such - there is a smokers' lounge but we don't smoke!It is a 5 minute walk to the U-Bahn stop at Mehringdamm and if you have a 3 or 7-day travel ticket it is really easy to get around Berlin. Just around the corner from the Sarotti is Bergmanstrasse and a huge selection of eating or drinking places - very good and good value! On Christmas Eve we went to a Carol Service ,,Christvesper in the Berliner Dom - wonderful! On Christmas Day we queued in the freezing cold with our German friends to go to up to the (Norman Foster designed) dome of the Reichstag but it was well worth it! and that night we went to a Weihnachtskonzert in the new Philharmonie. If you like modern architecture a boat-trip will take you up the Spree and you will get an amazing view of the Bundeskanzleramt and the Reichstag.... We would both say you should not miss going to see Nefertiti (in Altes Museum at the moment); more beautiful than the Mona Lisa we reckon by far. The queues at the Fernsehturm were so long we did not wait.
