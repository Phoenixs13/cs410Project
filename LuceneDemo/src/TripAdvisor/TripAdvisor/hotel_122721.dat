<Content>Literally Execrable This apparently independently-owned and operated hotel tried hard in some respects, but not at all in others.The good news is that they were running some sort of shuttle service as a side business, or at least were on Texas-OU weekend. For a negotiable price, your large group can be transported all over town in a roomy van and not have to mess with a cab. This was very convenient. Of couse, they were unavailable Saturday night after the game, and anyone who has experienced the free-for-all that is the cab experience on Grand Avenue after the game can testify that this was an unhappy development (as a side note, Dallas cab drivers are worse than any others on Earth, aside from Athens, Greece).The neutral news is that the nice long bar pictured on their website is indeed a bar, but there is no bartender and no booze. An enterprising sort could haul a cooler to the bar and tune the TVs to playoff baseball, as our group did, but it is certainly not what the website suggested.The bad news is, there was a significant sewer backup sometime Friday night. The staff adressed the problem with squeegies and fans, declining to call a plumber. All weekend. When confronted with evidence (e.g., a toilet that would not flush, a bathtub full of undetermined liquid), the assistant manager simply stared at the rising water and maintained that everything was fine. It was somewhat surreal. When a member of our party who went without a bathroom for 2 days asked for, say, one night's discount, said assistant manager asked how much he paid for the room, and finally offered 50 bucks for our troubles. To top it off, his colleague at the front desk refused to pay it, telling this weary travleler to call Hotels.com. We eventually left with two crumpled twenties when the front desk brain trust figured it was bad for business to have an angry man yelling about sewage in their lobby.

<Content>Pleasant and a good value for the money We stayed here in a king room for $44 per night, the coupon price from one of those rest area discount guides. We liked it enough that we extended our stay to two nights.We had a pleasant if not huge room on the fourth floor, which had a sliding door that opened to a balcony and treetop view. Furnishings were nice and included an easy chair. The TV had limited cable. The room was adequately clean. The air freshener was noticeable but we were able to leave the slider open while we were gone, which allowed the room to air out adequately. The bathroom featured a granite counter and fluffy towels but was very small; the toilet paper was hidden under the sink behind the toilet, requiring a certain amount of underhanded stretching backwards. This being an upscale sort of place, we were supplied with real glasses (one dirty) and mugs. Perhaps it was related to being on the fourth floor, but the water pressure in the shower left a lot to be desired, and the low-flow showerhead didn't help the situation.The front desk staff was helpful and accommodating.Breakfast was not included in the rate.The hotel is centrally located, a bit of a challenge to find if you're not familiar with the local freeway system, but once you know where you are it is convenient to any number of things.Overall, despite a couple of minor quibbles, this hotel was pleasant enough and an excellent value for the money we paid. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Good value...nice place Clean hotel in a fairly decent part of Dallas. If you are using Choice Privileges points, it鈥檚 a great value for 6000, and a good value for 8000. The front desk help was good. I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to use it again.

<Content>Comfortable and clean I have stayed at several hotels in DFW trying to find one to fit my budget without sacrificing cleanliness and comfort. The Clarion fits the bill and I will be staying there again soon. The only criticism was the service at the front desk. At check-in the desk clerk was cold and didn't care about my requests. When I got to my room he initially refused to do anything about replacing the missing remote. While waiting for a replacement I found it under the couch. Despite that initial road bump my stay was pleasant and uneventful.

<Content>Mixed feelings After reading some of the reviews on here I was very nervous about the hotel. We had a large group staying at the hotel. For $55 a night it was not bad at all. There were a few problems and a few good things. When you first get into the hotel, its very nice. The lobby is very up to date and the lobby bathrooms were very nice. The front desk help was not overly helpful and kind-of did not seem like they really knew what was going on. After we got all checked in, we went to our room, that is when I found out the pool was not open yet. When someone from our group called to ask about the pool they told them ''yes we have a pool'' but did not offer up that it was not open yet. We took the elevators to our room. I though they smelled funny and made a funny noise, but no one else seamed concerned so I just let it go. Well a few other times I was walking past the elevator shaft room I could still smell rubber burning, so I took the stairs most of the time. The last time I rode it, someone in our group told me that a person on the 4th floor got stuck in the elevator! So from then on, I did not ride it again. The rooms were very clean. I was impressed. When we were walking down the hall the carpet was really stain and the trim was falling off the walls, so I though for sure our room was going to be crappy. We got in there and it was nice, clean, up to date, and fresh smelling. Everyone in our group did have a problem with the water鈥t was not very hot鈥ore like lukewarm. We did not have breakfast in the lobby ever. I did hear it was $7 all you can eat. The bar was never open for us. It was right of 635, each to get to and to get to other places. Like the others said though you were not able to hear the interstate noise. Over all the hotel was nice. I wish they would have been up front about the pool. The hallways needed some work. There were a few women working the front desk a few nights that were great and very helpful. But the older guy and younger kid鈥id not really know what was going on. IF you are looking for a cheep place to say, this would be good. If you are looking for something a little nicer you may wanna spend money some where else. If we go back to Dallas ever, we will find a different place to stay.

<Content>Great Place to Stay I was a bit worried after reading reviews of this hotel here at Trip Advisor, but I could not have been more pleased. This hotel was very clean, nice, with a helpful staff. They offered free drinks at the bar during happy hour for guests and a free complete breakfast. The rooms were clean, spacious and just nice. This hotel is located in a central location with easy access to many points of interest. I would reccomend and would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Not what it used to be I have stayed at this hotel many times, since when it was a Doubletree. I will not stay there again. Night one, when I arrived the front desk clerk said the hotel was overbooked and they had to walk me. Then the hotel they sent me to was a motel. If I'm going to be walked it should be to a hotel of the same or better quality. I went back to the Clarion to tell the front desk clerk he was going to have walk me to some place else. When I arrived there was a line of over 20 people standing at the front desk. It was people from a local convention and none of their room keys worked. When I finally got up to the front desk and expressed my dissatisfaction he said one room had just become available and gave me that one.Night two, about 12:30 in the morning I hear beep beep rattle rattle rattle and then this process repeats about 3 times. A couple minutes later the phone in the room rings. It's the front desk. The man says Our system shows this room is clean an unoccupied. I inform him the room will be occupied until Friday. Night three, I get back to my room and my key doesn't work. I go to the front desk and tell him. He asks for my room number and takes the key and reprograms it. That's it, no ID, no who are you, no identity verification at all. Just tell the guy a room number and he will program your room key to open it. In addition to that about half of the lamps in the room didn't work, the air conditioner dripped water on the floor and left a 4ft wide soaking wet spot on the carpet, and the base of the tub was covered with mold. This hotel used to be good value. It's not what it used to be.

<Content>Terrific Hotel for the Price We stayed one night when we came into Dallas for shopping. The hotel is close to the Galleria and lots of other shops. It is conveniently located on 635, yet I never heard any traffic noise. Our room was spacious and clean. The sheets were nice and smelled fresh. The towels were fluffy. The mattress was comfortable. The a/c was ice cold. Request for 3 extra pillows and late,r 2 more sets of towels were promptly met. The bathroom was small, but efficiently laid out. I liked the full length mirrors on an actual closet in the room. Plenty of nice hangers, too. They actually have glassware to drink from instead of the ubiquitous plastic cups you find in most mid-priced hotels. The bath amenities are of a nice quality. The lobby is very pretty and has work areas, that we did not use, for business travelers. I would skip the breakfast here, though and eat at La Madeleine at the Galleria. BTW, if you are not set on a certain hotel; use the Exit Information Guides available at gas stations and McDonalds. We were able to snag a walk-in only rate of $44.00 per night with the coupon available in these brochures. The downside-No guarantee a room will be available.

<Content>Gone downhill and getting worse! I was told that this place was sold in May 2006. It has deteriorated since then. The owners, who are on property, are rude and uncaring, the staff seems to know this and as a result, have stopped trying to serve the guests and do not care if the guest is happy or not. Room was not clean. Food in the restaurant was terrible.

<Content>Very Happy This was a very nice place to stay, very quiet rooms considering its right on a freeway. One of the lifts/elevators had a strange smell of burnt oil (I think a maintenance man must have spilt some when servicing the lift) but this faded towards the end of our stay. Very efficient and polite staff, clean and spacious rooms, everything anyone could ever want...why pay more?

<Content>Nice Hotel This hotel was very nice and definitely up to what the pictures showed. The staff for the most part was friendly. The rooms were clean. Be aware that there is an extra charge for the refrigerator and/or microwave. I did encounter an problem but the manager on duty made sure I was happy with the outcome. Also, they prefer that you book directly through them to get better service instead of booking through an online service.

<Content>Great Business Hotel The lobby work area is great! Private cubicles for my meetings were available as well as free high speed internet. Bar crowd a bit slow but convenient. The rooms were clean and the staff is super friendly. I was nervous about the location when I first got there due to some highway construction but didn't hear a thing.

<Content>Great value, Nice digs This hotel is a fantastic value. It is a fairly new property, very clean with a helpful staff. The only two down sides 1) it is located near the construction of the new High Five overhead exchange at the intersection of 75 North and 635-East and West, and 2) the Au Bon Pain bakery located there is overpriced for the quality of food. If you are looking for a clean and upscale business hotel that is quiet, this should fit the bill.
