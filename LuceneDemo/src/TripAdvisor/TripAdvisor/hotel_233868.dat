<Content>Great hotel I have just returned from 4 nights in the Heinrich Heine hotel in Berlin. What a great place, and I don't just mean Berlin itself. Well-located, the hotel is only 2 Underground stops from Alexanderplatz, from where you can get just about anywhere in the city on its excellent transport system. As a single traveller I am used to being put into rooms little bigger than a cupboard, but I was in what was more like a decent-sized apartment. There was an electric hob, microwave, dishwasher, fridge, mini bar, as well as an ample supply of tea, coffee etc. The bathroom was large and the sleeping area was bigger than many living rooms I have been in. The room was kept very clean as is the hotel itself. Reception staff were very welcoming (all spoke excellent English) and were very helpful. I will certainly stay there again and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

<Content>Great deal, great value! My partner and I stayed here for four nights in September 2006. I was a little skeptical about the value since I booked the hotel for a special price on Expedia (I think it was less than 80 euros a nightat the time). But I figured it was OK since it was affiliated with the NH chain, which is pretty well known throughout Europe (especially in Spain).We arrived pretty early from JFK on an overnight flight and got to the hotel at around 10 AM. Reception was very friendly and advised us that our room would be ready in 15-20 minutes. So, we left our bags with them and got some breakfast at the friendly bakery just outside the door. We loved the bakery so much we went there every morning for breakfast during our stay (and is much cheaper than the hotel breakfast). I could not believe my eyes when I saw the room. Spotless, tons of closet space and a kitchenette to boot. The bed was a standard European double (slightly narrower than a US full) and the mattress was a little firm, but not a huge problem to complain about. The bathroom was IMMACULATE and huge! It had a nice size tub (first one I've seen in Europe that actually fit me - and I'm only 5'10). Having stayed in hostels and mostly 2-3 star hotels, this felt like staying in a higher-end 4*. There's a supermarket almost directly across the street from the hotel where we bought a case of 11 beers for about 75 cents each! And having a fridge in the room comes in handy to keep them cool. There's also a bank around the corner if you needed to withdraw euros via ATM.The only drawback I would think of is that the neighborhood surrounding the Heinrich Heine is pretty quiet at night (though you always felt safe) and is a 10 minute U-Bahn ride to the center of Berlin. The U-Bahn is very convenient though and very safe. If you'reokay with that and a five-minute walk to the U-Bahn station, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel for its value and cleanliness.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel...! My fiancee and step-daughter surpised me for my 30th birthday with a trip to Berlin, a first for me and them and thankfully, courtesy of her rather impeccable taste, we stayed at the Heinrich Heine. The hotel itself could, to the first time traveller, seem a little off the beaten track, not slap bang in the center of all the tourist hot spots, but that is well and truly the only chink in the armour for the Heinrich Heine. It is located about five minutes away from a U-Bahn station and is on several bus lines (if you walk 300m up the road to the Moritzplatz U Bahn station a bus will take you to Kurfurstdamm as well as other great places to see) and the area in which it is located is superb. There is a lovely little shopping precinct practically out of the front door, which is filled with little shops, tobbaconists, cafes and even an Aldi supermarket. There is also a wonderful little bakery which makes amazing bread and cakes plus another 2 supermarkets, so there is pretty much all you need within a stones throw of the hotel.So, the hotel. A comfortable and extremely clean environment, with front of house staff who can't do enough for you. The rooms, well, you really have to see them to believe them....They will sleep at least four people (for 2 couples it would be ideal). There is a master bedroom with loads of storage and is warm, comfortable and within minutes it almost feels like home. There is a HUGE bathroom with 2 connecting doors, one from the master bedroom and another from the living area and the living room is MASSIVE. A sofa, three chairs and a desk plus a sofa that transforms into a double bed. And, there is a kitchen. And not just the usual self catering three ring electric stove and a few cupboards, but a wonderful fitted kitchen with dishwasher, hob, microwave and all the things you would need or desire. The housekeeping ensure the room is kept in pristine order, they even load the dishwasher with items you may have forgotten! In short, if you are after a lovely room in a quiet and safe area, then book at the Heinrich Heine. It made a wonderful trip to Berlin that little bit more special.

<Content>Home from home Apartments rather than a hotel, but facilities were excellent. The room in the last hotel we stayed in was a bit cramped so we were looking for something a bit spacious and more comfortable. This was ideal.Good location with good bars and restaurants around the corner. 20 minute walk along to alexanderplatz and about the same to potzdamer platz, you can pretty much walk to all the major sights if you've got the right shoes. There is also a U-Bahn station about 5 minutes away. There is an excellent bakery, supermarket and a chinese take away/cafe on the same site for those who are self catering.The hotel is in a residential area so you get a good feel for what it is like to live in Berlin rather than just being around all of the sights.Staff were really friendly and spoke excellent English.We would definitely stay there again if, or probably when, we go back to Berlin.

<Content>Roomy, clean, quiet - very good value Spacious, clean apartments, very quiet location. Fairly central - about 20 min walk to Alexander-platz and under 5 min walk to Heinrich Heinestrasse U-bahn stop. Nearest train station: Ostbahnhof. Breakfast is expensive, but cafes and bakery nearby offer much cheaper alternatives.

<Content>Bit of class Very spacious suites, very clean and well equipped (even had a microwave and dishwasher - and there's a handy supermarket just out front). Two stops on the nearby U-bahn to Alexanderplatz. I couldnt recommend it highly enough. When I go back to Berlin, that's where I'll be staying.
