<Content>Clean room, reasonable value for the price My room was small but clean. It was not noisy.The hotel has no real amenities.The service was fine.I was traveling on a budget, and this place worked out for me well.It is next to the red light district, which is not a great place. But it was located only a few minutes walk from where I was working.I believe that it offers fair value for the money.

<Content>OK !! Location good, thats about it, single rooms very small had to upgrade to double. No bar or restaurant this is a low 3 star hotel and you realy do get what you pay for.Was staying on business and had some late nights and constantly put do not disturb sign on Door, but every hour from 8am cleaners kept banging door! even with do not disturb sign on !!!!!Eventually had to be rude and tell them to stop knocking.

<Content>Good location, clean We stayed at the Hotel Domicil in October 2007. The rooms were clean, the location was convenient to the train station and the desk staff were helpful. We did not try the breakfast as it seemed a bit pricey and the internet access in the lobby, while convenient was not friendly to the user. We originally had booked at a Best Western sister hotel near the other side of the train station. They bumped us for a tour group, but did pay the cab fare and for any difference in room rates. A bit inconvenient, but not a great hardship as this was a slightly better location. Noted this because it could happen in reverse.

<Content>Hotel Domicil Just discovered 'Trip Advisor' and as a seasoned traveller, I ought to add some reviews. Stayed here in July 2004. The hotel is close to the red light district of Frankfurt, by the main railway station. Although this is limited to two or three streets, this may be an eye opening experience for some as in one street the local drug addicts flopped out! As for the hotel, I had a single room. It was clean and tidy. Minor quibble was the drooping shower head in the bathroom. As for breakfast buffet, this seemed to vary each morning in terms of quantity and items offered. Reasonably priced for the standard of accommodation provided.

<Content>Good value in central station area. I've been staying here for many years, because of its handy location and the reasonable rates during trade fairs. I've tried many of the hotels in the central station area and this is probably the best mid-price one. It's really a business hotel and I wouldn't take my family there; you can do much better out of fair time. The rooms vary in size and the single ones can be small and cell-like. Ask for a twin room for single use on the rear. Having said that the staff is friendly and the breakfast quite good.

<Content>Not for families Our extended family of six recently spent one night at this hotel. We were flying out of Frankfurt the next morning so I booked us into what I felt would be a quiet, clean, safe Best Western hotel. I had made reservations well in advance and asked for two triple rooms. This request was confirmed but when we arrived only one triple room and one double were available, so they put my son in a single room (at no charge), his wife and son in the double and my husband, myself and our granddaughter in the triple room two floors away from the rest of our family. But this was a minor problem.This hotel is in a questionable location with girlie shows, men's clubs etc. surrounding it. When we asked the desk clerk where we could eat dinner that was close to the hotel, we were told there wasn't any place safe or suitable to take a family in that area. We ended up driving several miles before we found a place. Parking in the evening in Frankfurt is difficult at best and parking for the hotel is a block away. There was constuction going on next door to the hotel and this construction went on all night, making sleep almost impossible.The only plus to our experience was the breakfast served. The hotel puts on a great German style breakfast.Would I stay in this hotel again...NEVER.
