<Content>I don't recommend this Ramada Stayed on Nov. 22nd and 23rd of 2008. Firstly, the front desk is not friendly and not helpful. Make sure to get your stay rate either faxed to you or printed out from your email confirmation..because they will try to play dumb and up the rate upon arrival. Also, if you book the Cowboy Package, as we did, make sure you have that in writing because they will try to charge you for the shuttle to the Stadium(which should be free). KEEP your Confrmation print out!!! Very important! Secondly, The water pressure was terrible..I had read it in the reviews before I booked and asked them about it over the phone. They assured me there was no problem with the water. NOT TRUE!! Not only did the water pressure suck..the pipes were very loud...and at 2:00 am...just imagine! Oh, The smoke alarm also woke us up twice in the early a.m. ...apparently for no reason. If you like to sleep, don't stay here!

<Content>Hotel not bad, but couldn't receive refund! We are from Louisiana and had a hurricane coming in our direction. We were issued a mandatory evacuation order so we booked two rooms at the Ramada. I booked the rooms through Expedia; BIG MISTAKE! The reservation was originally a four night stay, but because the evacuation order was lifted after two nights we checked out early. The hotel assured my mother that she could contact Expedia for the refund for the remaining nights. I contacted Expedia several times and received unsatisfactory service several times. Finally, I was able to speak with a rep that was helpful. He contacted the hotel for approval to issue my mother's refund and was denied by the hotel because apparently the rate was a special rate and my mother had to stay for three nights. I told him that she could be charged for the extra night and be refunded for the fourth day. The hotel would not help. Expedia did issue my mother a $50 hotel voucher (that she will probably never use!) in the end. I also tried contacting the Ramada customer service and they were not helpful either. So, my advice is if you are an evacuee for a hurricane or any other act of God, DO NOT STAY AT THE RAMADA. They will not be sympathetic to your situation.

<Content>Do Not Stay At Ramada_Dallas Love Field *******THIS IS A DUMP!!!!!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED****** Let me first say I have stayed in this hotel on many (at least 10) occasions when it was branded a Fairfield Inn. It is now a Ramada under new ownership or management. PROBLEMS:1) Check-in....Clerk is slow and does not understand English very well. Took 15 minutes and I was the only one there. She could not answer rate questions and said she could not provide a small refrigerator for medical purposes as she was the ONLY person working in the hotel! (7PM)2) SHEETS WERE STAINED WITH BLOOD!!!! Did not notice until bedtime(12 am). No one on duty to change sheets!!!!!!!3) Could not play in room movies without a $50 deposit on my credit card and asked to come to office to put up deposit at 10 pm.4) Keys did not work upon check-in and had to return to office to be re-keyed.5) Roaches!!!!!! Several large cockroaches were in bathroom.6) Furniture and rugs were dated and stained as well.7) Management did not even offer an apology at checkout!!!!!!STAY ELSEWHERE!!!!!6) Management (Foreign????) did not even attempt to appoligize on checkout!!!!!

<Content>This hotel was good for family of 4. My mother stayed in a king, and my wife, 2 kids and I received the 2 double bed suite. The rooms were good. The service was great. The breakfest was unexpectedly great. The pool area doesn't look dingy and is fenced in. Very cool gazebo. Did not feel unsafe, as it is a very industrial area. Industrial area's on weekend are not bad at all to stay around. I do not enjoy staying around residential area's that are poor. The place is fenced in to only one entrance. The location was great. Our complaints.The wallpaper or color of the walls was very uncomforting. This meaning that the walls looked dirty because of it. The lobby was always hot, the side door closest to the entrance did not work with key (not a big deal at all seeing as how the front door is about 15 ft. from this) Beds were hard.

<Content>Pretty clean and comfortable- bad location Not much to say. This place was very decent, clean  comfortable. It is situated not too far from a sleazy strip club in a bad location. I would recommend this place to a single business traveler who has no interest in seeing the nice parts of Dallas. Good hotel for the price.

<Content>Great Place We recently stayed here and found it to be extremely clean. The hotel was older but appeared to have been recently remodeled. The bed was nice, the linens were nice and the room was extremely clean. We have stayed at many hotels that cost much more and were not this clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the shuttle service staff were also very polite. I honestly can not think of anything bad to say about our stay here and would difinately stay again.

<Content>Worst Hotel Ever This was the absolute WORST hotel ever. I booked the room through Orbitz, and read reviews here. After reading the reviews I thought I was safe. Big mistake. It started with the shuttle from the airport. I was the only passenger in the van and the driver stopped to pick up her friend. I then had to listen to their ghetto talk all the way to the hotel. When I got there I was told they couldn't find my reservation. They explained that the computer had lost all of the reservations. After 15 minutes it miraculously reappeared. I think the girl behind the counter was just totally incompetant. Then I was assigned my room, and I went up to change. I had plans to meet friends for dinner in 20 minutes so I didn't even have time to shower. When I came back at midnight I was totally exhausted and went right to bed. I got up in the morning and upon entering the shower I realized there was a dirty rag hanging on the shower head. I figured the maid had forgotten to take it with her. Five minutes later the maid comes in and explains that the room was supposed to be vacant. That it was never cleaned the day before. I started to look around, and to my absolute horror I noticed trash in the can, towels missing on the shelf, and the toilet paper was not folded all nice like they do. The house keeping supervisor explained that the room had indeed not been cleaned and that whoever checked me in put me in a dirty room. I was livid. The front desk staff told me there was nothing they could do to compensate me because I had paid through Orbitz. Then they tried to say it was somehow my fault because I didn't inspect the room when I checked in. That it was my fault I had slept in dirty sheets. This story is long enough so I will just add one more thing. The shuttle driver on the way back to the airport dropped me off five miles form the hotel and nowhere near the airport, because he was going somewhere else first and didn't want to drive all the way back to the airport. He radioed for another shuttle to come and git this dude from shugga baybees, he need to go to da a-pote and then left me in a parking lot in the blaring sun. I am mortified at the though of anyone else staying at this hotel. Please Beware.

<Content>Nice Stay After a Trying Day! During a day of nasty weather at DFW Airport, our flight was hopelessly delayed for 11+ hours. We were finally de-planed at Love Field and had an unplanned night in Dallas. Many of us from the flight booked a room at the Ramada Inn. While everything around DFW was booked, this hotel near Love Field had plenty of rooms and a shuttle. I booked a AAA rate for around $75 for two. It was a great end to a memorably bad day! The room was clean, and ours had a view of a nice outdoor pool. The beds were good, the shower was strong, and the internet access was free and reliable. After a good night's sleep, we had the hotel's continental breakfast. It included muffins and a waffle bar. Good coffee, too! It was nothing memorable, but there was plenty of food and it was kept clean by staff.The shuttle was great! It's free from Love Field, and we were charged $5 each to DFW the next morning (it was cheap because there were so many people from our re-routed flight in the van -- I believe he collected $35 total for the trip). On the way over from Love Field the night before, we asked the driver if there was any food near Ramada (the plane had no food), and he went through the drive-through at Whataburger, about a block away. Yup, it was that kind of day! The neighborhood didn't look all that great between Love Field and the Ramada, and we all quietly wondered what we were gettting into. But the hotel was terrific and exactly what we needed after a long day in the sky (and sitting on the tarmac).

<Content>Great Value and Clean Hotel I stayed at this hotel and had five rooms. They were all clean and neat and the staff was very friendly. There was a small breakfast that was plenty to get the day going. The price was right and the parking was easy and free. I had meetings in downtown and it took less than 10 minutes to get downtown in the morning traffic. I would definitely stay here again. For what I paid for 5 rooms per night at the Fairfield Inn I could not have stayed in one room where the meetings were held. It is a great value and served its purpose well.
