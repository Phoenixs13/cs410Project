<Content>Excellent This was an excellent small hotel, especially when I was traveling on a set allowance for work. The hotel is in a quiet residential street with good bus and metro links within 3 minutes walk, and the central Avinguda Diagonal within 15 minutes stroll, and the Nou Camp walkable in 30 mins. It was a pleasant bonus to have a small private balcony, the breakfasts were good, and the staff helpful. I got a taxi from the airport, which was convenient as the hotel is on the right side of town. Being in a residential area was nice, the local amenities weren't touristy or tacky, just pleasant. This hotel is a short walk to Sarria and the Pedralbes, both worth a look.
