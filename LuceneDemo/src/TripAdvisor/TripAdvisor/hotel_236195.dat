<Content>Unparalleled - Best service I have ever had in EU or US I can describe the service during my 5-days at this hotel with one word: unparalleled. From the people at the reception (Amelie, Alisa, Miguel, Fran and Daniela), all speaking perfect English and accommodating my every need, to Fran the barista, bringing me my espresso as soon as he saw me coming down in the hall in the morning, even without me asking. I could keep going, but then again I think I made my point. Extra nice, super-professional, yet never intrusive or overbearing, this is the most professional, best hotel staff I have ever ran into - and I do travel quite a bit, across the US and Europe. I wish I could get this type of treatment somewhere else, but I think it will be hard.Really, I am finicky about stuff, but these people really are a match to the superior, gorgeous design interior of the hotel hall! I will come back and recommend it to all people I know coming to Barcelona!

<Content>do not stay here if you speak no spanish This is a beautiful hotel,but the service is lacking if you don't speak any Spanish. Not one of the staff speaks a word of English.Consequently, we couldn't find out if the hotel has the facilities as stated on the website, reception was not aware if there is a gym/sauna, or if there is, where in the hotel it is...we couldn't get any room service, despite it supposedly being available all afternoon until 11pm.A very very disappointing experience, despite the lovely hotel building and room.I would think that a hotel that markets itself towards English speaking customers should make an effort to employ staff that have a basic understanding of the language.

<Content>Nice hotel in quiet residential location I just stayed at this hotel while visiting the UPC campus which is very nearby. If you are visiting UPC, this hotel is in an outstanding location, 5 minute walk from campus. The lobby and rooms are modern and stylish. My room was not large, but it was very modern and nicely appointed. The bathroom was gorgeous. The room overall had everything I needed, including free wireless internet. The most remarkable thing about this hotel is the staff. They go out of their way to help. When I arrived, the checkin process took only moments, and almost as quickly they had brought a fresh cup of coffee to my room. At checkout, they had my luggage into a taxi for the airport within about a minute of me appearing in the lobby. They are clearly well-trained, and it was a nice experience.

<Content>Nice hotel out in suburbs Stayed here recently for 鈧?5 per night / double room. Pretty good value.The rooms were modern and well appointed with effective air-con and the staff, who speak excellent English, were friendly and helpful.Buffet breakfast, while of good quality, was pretty steep at 鈧?4 per person.The main thing about this hotel is that it is quite far out of town and, although the bus service is pretty good, the most frequent bus (No. 22) takes a good 30 minutes to get into the centre, while the nearest metro station a 20 minute walk away. One advantage is that Barcelona Bus Turistic, which brings you to all the major tourist attractions, stops at the nearby Monastir de Pedralbes. Taxi fare to the city-centre is about 鈧?-11, depending on traffic.As noted in a previous review, however, the distance from the city-centre does mean that the hotel has nice views of the mountains. There's also a decent shopping centre on the Avinguda Diagonal near the metro station.Overall, we found the Sansi Pedralbes to be a decent base if a little too far from the city-centre; going back there every evening before heading back in to town for dinner, clubbing etc. was an hour-long round trip. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Barcelona, and we will be back.

<Content>Excellent value for money I stayed recently at this small, new hotel right in the centre of Barcelona. The biggest advantage is clearly the location. Aerobus drops one off right in front of the hotel (Gracia/Diputacio). From there Plaza Cataluna, Avda. Diagonal, Gracia etc. are in short walking distance. Apart from that one gets to stay in a very modern, nicely designed hotel with all amenities one would expect. Only downer was breakfast. But I guess for 65?/doubleroom one can live with that.
