<Content>Great Place! We were in town visiting my brother who lives close to the airport. The location was perfect for what we needed. If you want to be close to the airport then this is the place. The hotel was very clean. Breakfast was decent. It was what you expect at a Hampton. The rooms were large and updated. Looked like a new flatscreen! The bathroom looked new and was clean. The only complaint was that the pillow was hard as a rock. I called for a feather pillow and they delivered it within 10 minutes! That pillow was a thousand times better. I really don't have anything bad to say about this hotel. We will for sure stay again when we visit.

<Content>Nice room We booked a rewards room and were extremely pleased. We were driving cross country with a 7 year old, a 4 year old and a dog. This property does not allow dogs so the dog was staying with my sister in Phoenix when we stayed here. The hotel seemed new, check-in was a breeze. The room was large and clean. The bed was very comfortable. Having stayed at many hotels over the years I can say that they all offer the same hot breakfast and we really aren't impressed but most people seem to love it. They had eggs and biscuits and gravy, pastries, cereal, yogurt, etc. Enough to get the kids going anyway. I used the laundry room, we used the wireless internet. Everything was fine. The front desk staff was mostly unfriendly but I am long past the age when I care about things like that. I want a clean room, a comfortable bed and a quick check-in. The Hampton Inn delivered on that. I would stay again.

<Content>Another great Hampton stay We, myself and two little children, had a good 2 night stay in this hotel. The front desk staff was very helpful. They have a file of copies of clear, printed directions to some common destinations ( zoo, car rental return etc) which was much appreciated. Good location convenient to the airport as well as attractions like the zoo, the US Airways centre, Chase field. I always appreciate the predictability of Hampton standards - great beds, clean rooms and this one did not disappoint. Room was clean and quiet with a small refridgerator and microwave that was great for this family. Nice selection of fresh food at breakfast. Parking plentiful and convenient. We also,like previous reviewers experienced some problems with a somewhat bipolar cooling system - unable to keep it from swinging from uncomfortably hot to too cold . And our sink drain would not plug. In both cases attempts were made to improve the situation. There was a big dust storm while we were there that left a lot of debris in the pool - it was completely cleaned up by next morning after the storm abated. We have had nothing but good experiences with Hampton Inns anywhere.

<Content>Room reeked of smoke Our room reeked of smoke. It was awful. Anyone with asthma would have faced a dangerous situation. We complained but they were unable to give us another room. To compensate they offered us a free night within the next half year but since we did not return to Phoenix that soon the free night offer was useless. It was an unfair bargain: they got our money but we did not get what they promised and we paid for: a smoke free room.

<Content>Pretty decent stay Just finished up a three night stay at this hotel and everything was pretty good. As a Hilton Diamond member I always request the highest floor, away from the elevator, but this time I was given a room on the second floor. I asked to be put on a higher floor, but they didn't have anything available. Ok, that was fine, but the only complaint I had was being on the second floor, I heard every footstep of the party staying above me. It was very loud at times and one morning the noise actually woke me up. Other than that the hotel is in a great location, very accessible to pretty much anything you want to do in Phoenix. The front desk staff is very friendly and the overall cleanliness is good. This is my second stay at this property and I would definitely consider it for future visits to Phoenix.

<Content>Nice Staff  Very friendly staff - so helpful with directions. Hotel is located near airport and good access to freeways. Rooms were clean, breakfastwas great and the kitchen staff even gave me fresh-baked cookies to take to some kids I was picking up at the airport. Asian Plaza across the street has Quiznos and some local fare. IHOP, Applebees and a grocery store are north on 44th at Thomas.

<Content>Good Hotel, but customer service issue handled poorly We stayed at one night at the Hampton Inn after seeing allthe great reviews by other trip advisor travellers. The hotel is conveniently located near the PHX airport about 1 mile north of the airport, also across from the only chinese plaza in PHX complete with an asian grocery center and restaurants.Our rooms were up to standards expected for the Hampton Inn, well appointed rooms, clean and comfortable beds. There was free WI-FI, business center with 2 computers and internet access/printing, and also a fitness center with a few exercise machines and one weight training equipment.Our overall stay was pleasant, however we soon realized that the shower in the bathroom did not work properly - in fact, there was barely any water coming out of it. Initially, we approached the receptionist and they stated that since everyone else was using the showers, there was not enough pressure; we realized that this was not the case since my spouse had tried taking a shower in the late afternoon the night before and had similar problems. there was clearly not that many people using this at that time.We are still awaiting the response from management, i think this is an overall well run hotel, but would be careful of the showers; try them before you accept your room - it's hampton inn and they guarantee 100% satisfaction, so we'll see..

<Content>Cleanliness issues We stayed here before an early flight out the next morning. The front desk person was not overly eager to help us, but did allow us to checkin early. The room was large with a separate living and sleeping area.Several of the towels were dirty or stained so ended up stealing some from the pool. Also, the floors did not appear to be vacuumed recently, or at least very well.Parking was only located at the far end of the hotel and the closest rooms were still 100 feet from the closest parking spot. The airconditioner had some issues in our room and would not maintain a constant temperature. We were up about every hour to adjust it as it was either 65 degrees or 85 degrees in the room. The pool and hot tub were nice. There was also a fitness center with the typical cardio machines but also a multi-use weight machine. Continental breakfast was fine, but nothing special.I'd probably try to stay at the Fairfield Inn by the airport instead.

<Content>Great Airport Hotel We stayed there for 1 night only, due to an early flight the next morning. We checked in at 10 pm and got a nice room on the second floor. Had dinner at the asian center across the road, returned the rental car and arrived back to the hotel at around 11.30 pm. Everybody at the hotel was very nice.The AC was blowing 63 degrees in our room and it was freezing and so I just turned it off (the control on the wall, instead of temperature, press off). So we had no problems with that, as the previous reviewer did. The room and the bathroom seed new and was nice. I'm a light sleeper, however did not detect any noise from the street, maybe because we had to leave at 5 am. The shuttle was there and on time, the breakfast was in the bag and the recipt was accurate.As far as airport hotels go, this one is very good. I would recommend this property to anybody at the airoprt in Phoenix.

<Content>Accessible to Airport or I-10 Easy access to the Airport or even I-10 (the Red Mountain Freeway). We usually have personal business along east McDowell Avenue. In comparing between the Embassy Suites further north along N. 44th street, this Hampton Inn looks more pleasing to the eye. In fact, further north on 44th street, there is a shopping center, i.e. Target Store, if personal items are required. The hotel went through renovations to the front lobby in comparison to our last visit in 2006. The front lobby has more of an executive look to it especially since dark, wood/panels were used. The front staff was friendly and receptive. The Hampton Inn food is typical with the nearby food attendent moving food around and refilling canisters. We stayed in Room 429 (on the Northweast end) and not much(if any noise from the streets/freeway). In fact, the air conditioning with temperatures set at 66 degrees was blowing most of the night. There was no way to turn the a/c off - so why have the temperature 'control' on the wall? There was also no way to 'get' coffee as the cafeteria lobby with HD TV was closed. The only other lobby open was the front desk with a few leather sofas. You do need to have an assigned access code from the Hotel if you plan to use the enclosed business room to check e-mails....Overall, we would consider staying a 3x in the future.

<Content>They gave my room away I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions prior to a flight since I live two hours from Phoenix. The family suite works well for my family of five. We got a late start from Prescott and arrived about 10:30 pm to find out that our suite had been given away and we were given a smoking room with two double beds instead. We thought we might tolerate the room for one night, but we could barely breathe. Even though I am a HiltonHonors Silver member and had reserved my room with a HiltonHonors American Express card, they gave away my room to someone who had arrived earlier. Since no other rooms were available, we ended up relocating to another hotel at 11:30 pm.

<Content>Nice stay We chose this hotel after reading reviews on this web site and because it's near the airport. We wanted to leave our rented car the evening before our flight and so we needed a complimentary shuttle from and to the airport.We checked in, left our luggage in the rooms and asked what we should do once we left the car. The reception gave us all the help we needed and also fixed the shuttle for the day after. The rooms are very nice,clean and spacious. We didn't use the pool because we were too tired but considering the temperature outside it wouldn't have been a bad idea!

<Content>Excellent Hampton Inn First of all, I usually seek out Hampton Inns when traveling on business because I have found their franchise standards to be quite high, resulting in a consistency that one looks for when traveling. Free high-speed internet, comfy beds (and a variety of pillows), and a very clean room.Second, this particular Hampton Inn appears to have been recently remodeled, so I found everything to be in excellent condition. Everything from the exterior to the lobby to the rooms were excellent.Third, the front desk clerk (Christy?) was extremely friendly and was able to provide us with easy and clear directions to nighttime entertainment, as well as getting to the airport.It's amazing how everything I just described should be easily accomplished by virtually any hotel, but since today's world is mired in mediocrity, it's places like this Hampton Inn -- places that try to be better than average -- that make stays enjoyable.

<Content>Not bad - as airport hotels go Typical Hampton Inn in most regards. Pleasant staff, standard architecture.I arrived in Phoenix, needing a room at the last minute - they offered me a good rate, and I was thrilled to get it. However, they said their shuttle service ended at 11:00 PM, and it was about 11:05. Therefore, I should take a cab - and get this - they would pay for it! 2 points for them. (I wish the Phoenix cabbies were as pleasant as the hotel staff).So, when I got to the hotel, it was about 11:30. The room was lovely, and divided quite distinctly into a sitting and sleeping area. Just a room (not a suite), but well laid out. Comfy bed, and nice, large bathroom. So far so good. I finally unwound and fell asleep about 1:00, secure in the knowledge that I had made my return shuttle reservation for 7:00 AM (This particular property requests that you book your shuttle the night before). So, it was unfortunate that I received a call from the desk at 4:30 - wanting to know if I had planned on being on that 4:30 AM shuttle.So, that part was a bummer - but I understood the need. If I had booked a shuttle and overslept, I would want them to call. I was just annoyed that my already reduced sleep had been interrupted. There was a mixup in room numbers.Anyway, it did not detract from my overall opinion of the hotel. If I were in the area again and needed a quick sleep - the Hampton Inn Phoenix North would be on my short list.

<Content>A suitable airport hotel We spent one night at this hotel and as a fan of most Hampton Inns, I felt that this one lived up to most of their standards. It was clean and nicely decorated. They have a well equipped business center with one computer, printer, copier, etc. We asked for a top floor room as we wanted a quiet location, but were placed in the room next to the vending machines (with ice clinking down on a regular basis). Highway traffic noise was also loud at times. Both problems could be avoided had I been more astute when first entering the room. Their shuttle service to the airport is very good.The one problem that they were not able to take care of was finding pillows that weren't the size and comfort of a beach ball. The two Hampton Inns that we stayed in on this trip had large foam pillows .... nice if you like to have your head propped up on an awkward angle :-) I asked for either thinner foam pillows or feather ones. When they had not arrived 3 hours later, I phoned again but was told that they had loaned all of their other pillows out and had not received them back from the other guests. I guess if that many people are requesting different pillows, it means that most people do not find their regular pillows to be very comfortable. Their w/e rate was fairly reasonable.

<Content>Very near the airport Good place to sleep. Best feature: near the airport. Pool was only reasonably clean. It was also heated to a very warm temperature. Expanded buffet was good. Like other Hampton Inns it features scrambled eggs shaped by a machine into pancake-like objects. Edible but no more than that. 44th street is very busy - ask for a quiet room if traffic noise is not your thing.
