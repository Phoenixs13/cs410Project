<Content>Excellent Hotel! Stayed 3 nights at the NH Sant Angelo, and what a wonderful stay it was!Check in was very efficient and polite, and very helpful.Our room was large(unlike some other reviewers?), spotless and tidied daily.The breakfast buffet is great...fresh fruit, cereals, pastries, a few hot options, toast, juices, tea, coffee, yoghurt, etc.Free soap, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, comb, razor and foam, toothbrush and paste, chocolates and mints. Lovely soft fluffy towels. Large TV. Fridge(mini bar). It is a few minutes walk from a couple of Metro stations and the bus stop is around the corner.It is in a lovely part of the city..near to everything but without the noise of being too close to Las Ramblas.All in all, we had a brilliant stay, and would definetly stay here again.Thanks!!!!

<Content>Would recommend it My boyfriend and I spend a long weekend in Barcelona, and were trying to find an affordable but comfortable hotel within reach of the main Las Ramblas area of Barcelona. We went on many review sites including Trip Advisor, and settled on the NH Sant Angelo based on the reviews given which said that it was a comfortable, and above average hotel. The hotel was easy to reach from the Arc De Triomph bus station (which connects to the Barcelona Girona airport) and it is less than a 10 minutes walk from the nearest Metro station. There are 3 Metro stations close by, along with Sant railway station. From the nearest Metro station, it is about 10 minutes to Las Ramblas (on the Metro) and about 20 minutes walk. The only drawback would be a slightly undersized room but this seems to be typical of most European hotels. The pics shown are accurately descriptive of the hotel, and the receptionist staff were all very friendly and instantly provided us with bus timetables when requested.The best thing about the hotel was the breakfast which came included within the price. It was a buffet breakfast, and consisted of pastries, croissants, cereals, yoghurts and drinks, juices, fruits, cold meats, scrambled eggs and chorizos. This was one of the widest array of choices in a buffet breakfast that we've had so far for the level of hotel.We would recommend this hotel if you are searching for an affordable and comfortable hotel with a good level of service.

<Content>loved the buffet breakfast I've recently returned from Hotel NH Sant'Angelo in Barcelona.The Hotel is nice and the staff at the reception are friendly and helpful.The buffet breakfast was very good with several qualities of bread, yaourts, cheeses, juices etc.The only drawback was the size of the room, which was really rather small when compared with the photos in the hotel site. I was rather disappointed with that.Furthermore I could ear whatever was goin on the next room's bathroom. Considering everything it was a good experience and I woudn't mind staying there again.

<Content>Lovely hotel NH Sant Angelo We have just returned from a weekend break in Barcelona with 2 friends. We booked through an online hotel site. The hotel is in the city centre next to Joan Miro park and we paid 拢60 per night per room. My friends had been to other NH hotels, and this was just as nice  clean, decorated in a contemporary style. Breakfast was not included (like most of the hotels in Barcelona). It is located 5 minutes walk from Sants train/metro station  3 minutes walk from Espanya  Tarragona metro stations. We bought 3 day travelcards for 拢13 and thus travelled throughout the city. The nearby restaurants are authentic Catalan, but this means Spanish only menus.We definitely recommend staying here if going to Barcelona.

<Content>Easy to get to, Clean and efficient Stayed at this hotel for a long Weekend while in Barcelona on holiday.Was the cheapest I could find which belonged to a reliable chain, although I had never used NH before. Hotel was absolutely spotless, in a good location- about 5 minutes walk from the Metro station where trains run till 2am Fri/Sat and midnight the rest of the week. Room was small but well furnished and comfortable, it looked out on an internal 'space' but for the price we paid was good. A/C was a bit dodge but couldn't be bothered asking for another room and moving stuff, opened window instead. Not all staff spoke English and this hotel certainly showed it was a Spanish chain, however I speak minimal Spanish and got by. Certainly would stay again.
