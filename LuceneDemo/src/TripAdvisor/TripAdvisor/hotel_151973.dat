<Content>Horrible stay; non-responsive management We stayed here on New Year's Eve, because of the proximity to the Ponce airport . When we checked in, we advised that we had a 6am flight and needed a 3:45 am wake up call. Beginning at approx. 8pm, we heard very loud music coming from a poolside DJ. There were no guests around the pool. We called the front desk on several occasions and merely asked that the volume be turned down, so we could get to sleep. Each time, we were assured this would be done, but nothing happened. Finally, around 11pm, I went to the front desk in my robe and asked to see the manager. We were advised that the DJ refused to reduce the volume. There were no other rooms available, and we were told we would receive a refund for the night, since our room faced the pool and the music was too loud to permit sleep. After several follow-ups with the hotel, we never received the promised refund.

<Content>If you like the smell of mildew...this is the place for you I along with half of my bridal party booked our stay for a few days in order to save some money as we were going to stay at Ponce Hilton for two days. I must say after two days we went over to the Ponce Hiltion because we couldn't take it anymore. First and foremost the motel is overpriced for it's ammenities or lack thereof. On the second day a pipe broke and we didnt' have running water for at least six hours. My husband had to wash my hair with cold water bottles. After having a lengthy debate with the manager I was discounted a night's stay. The gym had ONE working treadmill that had one key...so if a guest used a key and forgot to return it no one was able to use the treadmill. There is no elevator so if you have a second floor room get ready to carry your luggage to the second floor amidst the hallways that smell like mildew or rotting towels..pick one. On the upside the complimentary soap smells great, and the motel is near everything. I would recommend this place if you had no where else to stay and would NOT stay past one night.

<Content>Nice hotel - GREAT STAFF! The hotel was OK, but the staff really shined. They treated my wife  I with wonderful service and great smiles. The pool looked nice, but usually had a herd of young children in it and so we never really got into it. This is no reflection of the hotel - just the time that we were there. But the real star here is not the hotel at all - As I said the hotel is so-so. The STAFF is the real star. They helped us with directions, WIFI Hook-ups, Phone service, Restaurants, Use of their business office (FREE!) as well as many great smiles. THANKS Folks! All in All a very good stay.

<Content>Simple, confortable, dark Its a good hotel for it's type. I wasn't expecting the Ritz for sure. Kinda pricey if you compare it with hotels from other areas, but it has an average price for Puerto Rico. Looks a bit dated and the hallways are a bit dark at night for my taste. The continetal breakfast was not very good. It's a good hotel for short stays, especially if you already live in Puerto Rico and plan to stay most of the time outside the hotel. The employees are very helpfull and kind.

<Content>enjoyable stay We stayed for 7 nights for a business/pleasure trip. The room was very comfortable, staff friendly and helpful, and the pool very clean. The pool area is very nice with a bar. We found the restaurant serviceable but nothing great. The continental breakfast had a good selection of pastries, cereal, toast,etc with coffee and juices. Having a washer and dryer available was handy and reasonably priced, never had to wait to use it. Would definitely return.

<Content>Horrible service, a disaster waiting to hapen Our traveling theater group was booked into this hotel despite having a not-so-great experience here the previous year. The Howard Johnson met our poor expectations. Some of our problems included: * The restaurant closing early with only a rude staff member shooing us away from the door.* The restaurant being routinely understaffed.* The front desk staff treating our group members rudely when we called with requests or complaints.* Inconsistent enforcement of rules, allowing some pizza delivery people to wander the halls but holding others at the front desk.* Fire exits being deadbolted shut.I have never encountered such rude front desk staff as when I brought the last item to their attention. One woman got up from the desk and walked away from me. An unfortunate circumstance for the few staff members, including one front desk worker and the bartender, who were very friendly.This hotel clearly has no understanding of the importance of fire exits. I hope no one gets hurt when this attitude brings about its results.

<Content>First and last I stayed at this hotel for 1 night; thanks God it was only a night! When I call to make the reservation they gave me a price of 163.00 (鈥渢axes included鈥?- we were 4), but when I checked in they told me a price of 185.00 because supposedly they charged only for one person, but when I went to check out they charged 201.00 supposedly taxes weren鈥檛 included. They assault me with these surprises, but I just wanted to leave. I have to say the staff didn't seem to care about anything, there is no elevator and internet is limited to the lobby area, no internet was available in the rooms.I have to admit rooms were clean but nothing especially memorable from my experience. It was my first time and my last here.

<Content>Nice Basic Motel I stayed at this hotel for a night and found it nice though I must agree that the rate is high for a hotel that would not be worth $60.00 per night if it were in Orlando.The room was really clean and it smelled good.That was a nice first impression.Another thing was the A/C which was working perfectly.Actually the room was too cold and I had to turn it off for a while.One negative point is that there is no elevator.Thanks God I was just carrying a small suitcase;otherwise I would have had to carry all the luggage upstairs.It is a two stories building,so,no big deal anyways.I would definitely go back if I am going for business.

<Content>Really not the best choice I stayed at this hotel with 2 friends for 1 night, wich was more than enough. I found the hotel terribly overpriced at 117 dollars per night. I am suprised it is allowed to carry the Howard Johnson name. The room was not really up to standard. The coffee maker in the room was not working. After notifying the front desk and an new coffee maker was promised, I never heard from them again, nor was the coffee maker changed. I had to buy coffee from a vending maching in the lobby. Breakfast is horrible. Just a prepackaged cinnamon bun, with juice and coffee, serviced in a space off the lobby area. It should be called a snack, not a breakfast. The promised internet was limited to wireless internet in the lobby area, no internet was available in the rooms. The website does not state this clearly. The hotel, the rooms and the corridors are quite depressing. One good thing can be said and that is that the (front desk) staff is friendly and knowledgeable.

<Content>service is horrific My family and I stayed at the Howard Johnson in Ponce and from check in time it was nothing but problems. The front desk gave us a room  the room wasn't even completely cleaned. The beds weren't made, there wasn't a shower curtain in place,  the bathroom vent wasnt working. As we are changing our clothing the maid walks in without even knocking at the door. We decided to go into the pool  my husband slips not once but twice because the tiles were so slippery as were other guest by the pool area but my husband got really hurt. My son which is like a fish did not enjoy the pool water because the water was so hot. Then with the package that we chose we were to receive complimentary drinks  breakfast but when we go to use them they told us that the tickets were no good  that they could not be used so after a constant battle with management we were reinbursed for the drinks  breakfast.Also their so called internet service was horrible you constantly got kicked off the computer. From the first night we stood at this hotel we wanted to leave. The service was horrific  the staff didn't seem to care about anything. Finally we checked out  went elswhere.

<Content>Not exotic, but quite comfortable My wife and I stayed here two nights at the end of April. Ponce is a lovely city, but the choice of hotels is pretty limited. We tend to like small, local places like the other paradores, but we had just come from a bad experience at one, so we opted for a plain vanilla, basic American motel when we reached Ponce.I think this is a former Day's Inn, and it shows. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Nothing especially memorable. A family kind of place.The swimming pool happened to be closed for repairs on our first night (bad timing); but it was delightful and offered an abundance of towels when it opened the 2nd day.A good value if you're not looking for a heavy dose of ambiance or luxury.

<Content>wonderful time My family and I stayed here last year when we took a trip around the island. We had a very good time here and we wanted to extend our stay but were'nt able to because it was a busy weekend. It was my first time here and we were assigned to a room on the second floor. The hotel was being renovated at the time, and although the first floor was very nice, work was still taking place on the second. My room was right next to where the work was taking place and they were using some sort of chemical that filled my room with an awful smell. I asked to be moved away from the construction area, and they immediately accomodated me elsewere. The rooms were very nice and very clean, and what I liked the most was that every morning like clockwork they would clean the pool. The facilities were very clean and the hotel was near everything. My family and I loved our stay in Ponce, it is a very charming full of history. We live in Puerto Rico but it is amazing how many places we've never seen! Ponce Inn made our trip delightful and we are definately looking foward to stay again.
