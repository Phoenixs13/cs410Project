<Content>great value We stayed for the Thanksgiving weekend. The $80 rate was a great value for a suite room with a king bed and a kitchen. The TV in the living room also had a VCR. The room was quiet, spacious and clean. A Kroger is less than half a mile away, and the hotel is next to a Racetrak gas station so it was easy to fill up with cheap gas. On the website, we asked for a room on a high floor, which we received. The rate includes a hot breakfast with bacon, eggs, potatoes, waffles, oatmeal, etc. and a happy hour every day. The hotel has an indoor pool, business center and fitness room. Unlike other hotels, wireless internet access was included without an extra fee. Parking was ample and free. When we asked to stay an extra night, the manager gave us the same $80 rate.Last year we stayed at the Doubletree Campbell Center whose glass walls transmitted all the cold air into the room and whose walls were paper thin. I was aghast the Doubletree Campbell Center received a high rating on TripAdvisor. We have had good experiences with the Doubletree chain, but not the one at Campbell Center. We will stay at the Homewood Suites instead of the Doubletree Campbell Center and save 50%!We have also stayed at the Fairfield Inn next door to the Homewood Suites Park Central, but the latter has a kitchen so it is a better value.

<Content>Ok - a bit dated After staying at Homewood Suites in Houston I thought this would be of a similar standard - I was wrong. Although everything is clean and fresh everything is really dated, from the lounge to all the units in the kitchen area. It's not in a wonderful position either, our room was on the ground floor overlooking an office car park. I wouldn't rush to stay here again.

<Content>Nice Hotel Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. A nice Hilton property - really nice breakfast each morning with waffles, eggs, bacon, cereals, hot oatmeal - anything you might want for breakfast - evening meal looked good, although I had dinner plans both nights - one night it was a pasta meal and the next night there was enchiladas, rice and salad..with wine and beer, tea or lemonade.The rooms are nice with a kitchen, refrigerator, etc. The bedroom is separate from the living room/kitchen. Hot tub was great!The front desk clerks are some of the friendliest that I have encountered.Overall, it was a nice stay - I certainly would stay there again and would recommend it to friends and family.
