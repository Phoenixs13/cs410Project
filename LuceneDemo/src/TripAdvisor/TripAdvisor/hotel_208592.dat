<Content>Great place to stay Stayed here for our wedding aniversary. Room was terrific, with a view overlooking the street. Room had balcony, where you could chill out and watch life go by.Room good size, clean and above what was expected for a 2* hotel.Reception staff very helpful.When i booked, i did not include breakfast (but wished i had done), as speaking with other guests, was informed the breakfast (for the price) was was excellent.It also saves looking around for a reasonable place to find breckie, that didnt cost an arm  a leg.Would recommend this hotel, and would most definately stay there again, if i returned to Barcelona.Ideal location, also

<Content>Most impressed Never stayed in a 2 star hotel before , but picked this after reading reviews and looking at location.On arrival all was dealt with proffesionaly , the room was a fair size on the 4th floor overlooking the steeet. All aspects of the room were good ( furniture, bathroom etc. ) and very clean. The location is good , litterally 100 metres from Las Ramblas and within walking distance of many bars / retaurants.. Would recommend the Bombay Spicy restaurant ( opposite hotel ) Also recommend the open bus tour of the city. We have stayed in worse 3 and 4 star hotels . Be warned Barcellona is an expensive place to eat and drink but still worth visiting.

<Content>Did not stay, but great location. I work for a travel company, and i was looking at the hotels in Barcelona. In my old place where i worked, i used to sell this alot and was lucky enough to go on a fam trip around Barcelona. I was not specifically going to this hotel, but on our way back from Par-al-lel i came accross it. I did not go in the hotel, so cannot comment on the rooms themselves. I think they are basic, but for location, it is fabulous! and low prices to boot!

<Content>Decent Budget Option Our goal was to spend as little money as possible on our hotels in Spain while still finding clean accommodation with excellent location. We met our goal with Hotel Espana. I would not recommend this hotel for those who plan to spend much time in the hotel for relaxation. We were rarely in our room except to sleep each night. The bedroom and bathroom were plain and clean. The bathroom was roomy and seemed much newer than the bedroom. The foyer, breakfast room and dining room had more character but appear tired. The gentlemen at the front desk, especially Vincent, were helpful and friendly.

<Content>Don't do it!!! Hotel was noisy, breakfast was rubbish, rooms smelt of drains  staff were not very helpful. 13 of us stayed in this hotel for my stag do, and even in our drunken state we all thought it was really bad. To be fair it was reasonably cheap (we paid 拢90 per room per night - 2 in a room) I have never stayed in a hotel this cheap abroad before and maybe it is what you would get for the money! Would suit deaf travellers with no sense of smell, as it was quite central for bars etc.Hotel photos look bad on the website, it is 10x worse in real life. Oh and one more thing when you come out of the hotel DO NOT turn left, if you do you will end up in a square full of rotten prostitutes  African pimps!!! Turn right and you will be about 1 minute from bars  resturants, we found the Irish bar on the end was a good laugh.

<Content>Great location.. A great location for a hotel in the center of the Ramblas. A beautiful old world foyer and rooms very clean and plenty of hot water and AC. Felt quiet safe in this area , but we have been to Barca before. The one drawback was breakfast there,forget it. Much better to go to one of the numerous cafe's in the area, like Flahertys bar and get the big breakfast .

<Content>loved the beautiful old decor Very last minute stay. No regrets. Staff very friendly and helpful. Bedrooms standard and very clean. Some of the guests were noisy. We loved the beautiful old decor, with some areas currently being sympathetically restored. Continental breakfast ok but would have liked to have had cereal offered as well. Sept. 6th 2008.

<Content>Vey good for the money paid! Ive never had a very good impression on Barcelona, when i think Barcelonai think of drunken Brits on hen and stag do's!!But how wrong was i!!Barcelona IS one of the most beautiful places i have ever been to with so much culture, i could not decide what to see first...Overview of our trip..Hotel Espana,,,This hotel is very cheap to stay at and with a 2* rating i was very concerned to what the quality of the room would be like...But i was pleasently surprised, first the hotel staff are freindly breakfast good and rooms very clean, BASIC but comfortable!!Would reccomend this hotel for the pure fact of its location right in the centre of the Rambla!! which in my eyes the best part of Barcelona, a long street leading to the harbour with resturants and spainish dressed up in all sorts trying to entertain you along the way, a must see!!From the airport:taxi or bus to centre then i advise popping into tourist informaton which is next to bus stop and they will give you directions to your hotel which is a 10 min walk, My advise:For 26 euros you can have a two day unlimited pass on the open top tourist bus which is well worth the money, this bus goes all round Barcelona stopping off at various tourist stops including olympic stadium, beach, harbour, port, aqauriam, barcelona football stadium (nou camp) cathedrals, shopping centres, zoo ect ect this bus allows you to hop on hop off as much as you like and with buses every 6 min you are never waiting long for the next to arrive , a must to see all the beautiful spots of barcelona,Enjoy your holiday i certainly did!! xxxxxxxxx will add photos shortly

<Content>Very good ! I am always a bit reluctant to stay in 2* hotels but this time I did the right thing! Hotel Espana was a very pleasant surprise: report quality/price was very fair. rooms were very clean, staff was really nice and helpful and breakfast was very good for a very convenient price. I definitely recommend it and will most likely return to this hotel if ever in Barcelona again.

<Content>Great hotel Just come back from three night stay at Espana Hotel in Barcelona. The hotel is great.......chabby chic and we loved it ! Our room was a good size with loads of wardrobe space.It was clean and had a good sized bathroom with clean towels every day. We used the safe in our room as we do everywhere we go. The location was second to none , right in the heart of thecity.We had no trouble with pickpockets and felt very safe walking everywhere .Loads of people were walking around at night down the small streets and we never felt threatened at all......in fact there was a great atmosphere !!The staff were friendly and helpful,the breakfast was the usual continental type ,but certainly adequate and you could have as much as you wanted ! Also the air conditioning in our bedroom was FAB as it was very hot while we were there .The only negative thing I can say is that we had an inside room with no view but then we weren't in the room that much !! All in all a great budget hotel and would certainly reccomend it to anyone !!

<Content>Slightly tatty in places but clean  We stopped here for 3 night in Dec 07 and found the place to be fine. It is about 100 yards off the Ramblas about half way up so in terms of location, you couldn't get better. The hotel itself is huge and very old looking but the rooms were fine and cleaned well every day. The court yard that is overlooked by most of the rooms is strange, its got a roof but feels like it's outside! My only criticism of this place is not of the hotel at all but the horrible, dirty little African prostitutes that swarm around you if you walk around this area in the early hours. There were 7 of us (all blokes) so I'm guessing that's why we were targeted, but coming out of the bars on the other side of the Ramblas at about midnight - 2am is an ordeal because of these dirty little, disease ridden prostitutes that swarm round you like a bunch of untamed monkeys. They try and confuse you by the sheer number of them and before you know it they've got their hands in your pocket trying to pickpocket you. The best way to deal with them is to keep your hands in your pockets and push them away anyway you can. Im sure this wouldn't happene if you are in a couple but as a bunch of drunken blokes, we were the target, particuulartly on the Saturday night. However saying this, I'm sure this is the case all the way up the Ramblas and not just around this area.

<Content>Suited us fine! After hearing all the bad reviews about this hotel, i was a little concerned about staying here but it was absolutely fine and it is a fantastic value hotel.The reception staff are very friendly, polite and speak good english and there are two computers in reception with internet connection. My first impressions of the hotel were very good, the decor and old design of the hotel make it look very appealing, the rooms however are much more basic- but we only wanted a place to sleep!We arrived in the day time and i was a little worried about walking back to this hotel at night, only because it is a side street but we had no trouble and there are plenty of people bustling up and down the side street and it is very well lit, so it was fine.The rooms are very basic and the shower could of done with updating but it was fine and very clean. The air con was good and the bed was comfortable with plenty of towels. The only concern that i had is that the door to the hotel room was old and i wasnt sure how much the lock could withstand if someone wanted to break in. For precaution sake, we would leave out tv and light on when we went out at night- we had no problems! There are safes available in the reception however, so we could of used these.Breakfast was very basic but nice and plentiful and enough to start you off in the morning. We never had an evening meal in the hotel but the restaurant seemed very popular both with people staying in the hotel and people coming in from outside.The most fantastic thing about this hotel is the location. It is literally just off of La Ramblas, enough to be near but not enough to be noisy. There is a Metro stop a minutes walk away and it is close to the harbour, the gothic area and great nightlife area, with bars, restaurants and outdoor cafes on las ramblas.The hotel is easy to find, simply take the A1 bus to Placa Catalunya, then either walk down La Ramblas or take the metro to Liceu and then the hotel is a minutes walk down a diagonal side street. The hotel seemed very popular with a mix of people, business men, school groups, young and old couples...

<Content>Great Location Not quite sure what all the bad press is about with this hotel!! It is situated in a great location just off Las Ramblas, its near the metro and waterfront and the hotel itself was clean!!! Not sure why people were mentioning the narrow street in its location, it was wide enough to fit two double decker buses, side by side.The room we were staying in had everything we needed. Clean sheets, tidy, and a modern bathroom. Water from the shower was good, enough towels in the room of 3 adults. The reception service throughout the day and evening (even at 4am) was excellent.I would recommend this place to anyone.

<Content>Espana Hotel Very old hotel but saying that we had a good room with plently of hot water shower could do with updating.The cleaner we had was excellent and made the beds each day with clean towels every day.Hotel is covered in scaffolding and a lot of work is being carried out so it did spoil it a little that we could not use balcony.When hotel has finished refurbishing I dont think there would be any complaints as it is in an excellent position just of fthe Ramblas.Food at breakfast was plently and good chocie.Remember it is a 2 star and is very good value staff very nice.All in all enjoyed staying at this quirky and interesting hotel would go again

<Content>Borderline Shabby Just on the cusp of rating this place a dump - the rooms are nothing like the ones pictured on the hotel's web site. In addition, I started sneezing as soon as I entered my room - maybe it was the dust bunnies on the ceiling fan but most likely it was the cleaning solutions used in the bath - a lingering soapy smell that kept me congested evey moment I was inside, including lying awake for hours with a wet towel over my head the first night. After a day of running the AC the smell dissipated enough for me to sleep the second night.If you can deal with that, the place is in a good location IF you want to be close but not too close to the chaos that is Ramblas, and the windows are of recent construction and very well sealed from the nonstop activity in the theoretically pedestrian-only street outside. The rooms are also individually air conditioned, and have ceiling fans. Everything worked and was clean. The hotel had no ice, but no one else in Barcelona seems to have ice either.If you want to be close to Ramblas, and aren't allergic to anything, this place might work for you.

<Content>fantastic location just returned from 3 night stay at this hotel. was a bit disappointed withoutside as hotel having a face lift. However rooms were clean, friendly reception staff. Breakfast disappointing. But a fantastic location that made it all worth while. I have only just read the other reviews previously posted, but am happy to say no thefts or cockroaches, one party of school kids whose worse crime was to eat more than their fair share of breakfast, they obviously liked it. Oh and my husband and his friend where propositioned by a couple of females of a jubious nature one night.

<Content>good central hotel We loved this hotel. We experienced none of the problems found in the other reviews. Our double room was clean, air conditioned and had its own safe. ( a deposit of 25 euro's and then charged at 2.50 euro's per day). The hotel is undergoing an external face lift so don't be put off by the external scaffolding. It is down a alley way off Los Ramblas but then all the streets off Los Ramblas are alley ways. We walked down it very late at night along with lots of other people and were perfectly safe, never felt uncomfortable. If you want a hotel that is all modern shining chrome than don't book it but if you want a central hotel, reasonably priced, with bags of character, friendly, helpful staff then you won't find better than this.

<Content>Great Location I stayed at this hotel when visiting Barcelona for a hen weekend and have no idea why if gets so many bad reviews. Yes the decor is a bit tired, yes it can be noisy but the location is perfect and for a weekend away with friends I would highly recommend it. Just remember, you get what you pay for and this hotel is cheep and cheerful (and clean).One word of warning though, if you are leaving on a late flight and plan on leaving your bags at the hotel after you check out, make sure you bring a luggage lock as whilst the luggage room is locked,anyone wanting to leave a bag or pick up a bag is simply given a key and unsupervised access and you rely on them to lock the door afterwards.

<Content>cheap and cheerful we stayed at the hotel espana for 3 nights in total for a friends stag weekend. it was far from a hilton but the hotel and rooms were clean and comfortable. the rooms had air con and en suite bathrooms which i understand had just been refurbished to an acceptable standard. the bedrooms were serviced every day and the hotels location was superb, right in the heart of the town. there was 11 of us in our group and not one of us had anything to complain about. if you want somewhere safe, clean and affordable to stay, whether you're part of a stag or hen party or just on a romantic weekend away, i'd thouroughly recommend the hotel espana. we had a fantastic time in a beautiful city. congratulations myth!!

<Content>Loved the Espana Hotel I don't really understand why this hotel has such bad reviews. Granted the rooms are kind of shabby but I don't know why you would spend much time in you hotel room if you are there to see Barcelona. I agree you get what you pay for. We had no problems with management and we loved the location since it is central to everything and near the subway. The hotel is a little loud at night but I have to say we had no problems sleeping. I also loved the breakfast area. We also had no problems being in the area around Las Ramblas. No one bothered us at all. We were careful about locking up valubles, as we did in every other hotel we stayed in. We stayed here for 3 great nights and we would defiintely come again.

<Content>Disappointed!!!! Went to Barcelona for my 40th with my sisters and a friend and even though we had a great time the hotel was nothing like we viewed on the internet. I had to ask to change rooms because of the state of the room and the bathroom. The second room offered was a touch better but it was like living in a hostel. Very disappointed that we were deceived by the photos shown on the internet. Will never stay in this hotel again unless it has been refurbished ie knocked down and re-built.

<Content>Very basic - bordering on shabby! Room we had was very basic - we are a family of 4 - there where 4 beds in room which left very little space to move! Room could do with a lick of paint and a new door. The bathroom was spacious enough but shower didn't work properly and the drips were causing mould on the wall. The hotel room and linen were clean and if you want a cheap, central base for touring the city, this hotel will suffice.

<Content>Good location, simple - clean but noisy at night. LOCATION: Slap bang on the Ramblas and a tube station. You do have to walk down a narrow street but never had any trouble with this. It looks worse than it really is on your first night.ROOM: Basic but clean. Everything worked. There was aircon and a television. There was a little balcony over the street. The bed was clean and comfortable, though there was much noise at night from outside. Also some of the other guests were a bit noisey. Bathroom was clean and everything worked.BREAKFAST: Simple, clean and quit nice selection of cold meats, cheeses, yougurt, fruit, muesli, fruit juices and coffee / tea.STAFF: I found them overall to be helpfull and chearfull - though I think having some grasp of Spannish helps a bit. RECEPTION: Nice - unusual. It is obviously an old building with interesting mosaics here and there. OVERALL: This is a simple, clean, basic place that is in a good location for exploring. It provides a comfy bed with air con, a roof over your head and fair / simple bathroom.

<Content>Only If You Have To This hotel is near Las Ramblas and metro, but I would not recommend it if you are looking for conveniences inside the hotel. Our room smelled musky, there is no shuttle to the airport, and you have to pay 2 Euros if you want to use the Internet for 15 minutes. It is located in an alley not far from many party goers. It seems that the hotel is being remodeled perhaps to resemble its former glory days if there were any.

<Content>won't be back We (both in our 30s) stayed in Barcelona and at the hotel Espana for 4 days/3 nights. The location of the place is superb, right in the center of town and the building from outside and the entrance area is thrilling - so much for the good things.The bad ones showed up as soon as we came to our room. It was a dark whole that smelled really bad, because the bathroom, that did not have a window was mouldy. The only (very small) window our room had, led to an inner courtyard that functioned as an amplifier to all the noises from the rooms gathered around it. There was plenty of noise from all the people and big groups coming and going all night (!). In the last night we were woken by a drunk man who poundered against our door and would not leave.The staff did not show any signs of courtesy and help and/or information was limited. I know I'll be back to see Barcelona, but I would not stay at the hotel Espana anymore

<Content>Character hotel An old fashioned hotel with character - plenty of modernist features and a great breakfast room and dining room.Ideally situated just off the ramblas and competitively priced.For location and price/value for money this was excellent - a good hotel in a central location, with very helpful reception staff.Rooms not the most up to date, and the walls are rather thin which means you can hear whats being discussed next door, and the occassional whiff of drains from the bathroom.However, for a short city break where not much time was spent in the hotel room it was fine and perfectly located

<Content>Enjoyed our stay We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Espana. It is classed as a 2 star but to be honest I have stayed in hotels in the past that were on par and gave themselves a 3 star rating.We hired a safety deposit box for valuables, passport etc but I would do that where ever I stayed.The room was basic but clean, the staff were friendly and helpful.The first night was noisy, (walls between rooms are really thin.) There was what sounded like a group of teenagers running around laughing who attempted to open our room door around 11.30 at night. (their idea of a joke) but to be fair that could happen anywhere.The location of the hotel is great, easy walking distance for the port, ramblas, bars, restaurants, market, etc..

<Content>What a HOLE!!! We went with the school not expecting much but a decent place to sleep at night...too much to ask! We were harassed whenever entering or exiting the hotel by the thugs lurking on this particular street and when opening our bedroom window we were perved on by the men living in the apartment across the street who were almost in reachable distance! The staff were unhelpful and impolite and did not make us feel welcome at all but more like a burden! Security was pretty slack and we did not feel safe knowing that downstairs there was another key to our room and the staff had a past record of stealing. The only saving grace was the breakfast which was alright. I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Had a Great Time Here !!!! Myself and my partner (both in our 30's) stayed here 17th Dec 06 for 3 nights, I feel I have to post a review as we never experienced ANY of the problems people have wrote here. The breakfast was nice, a good selection. The reception staff were ALL lovely and helpful in giving us directions (in paricular to the Nou Camp Stadium, which is a must) or answering any questions.The hotel itself is lovely, the rooms basic, (well we did go just to sleep and wash there) . It is a very good base to stay at, in an ideal location (right in the centre of Las Ramblas with 2 train stations on the doorstep).Our ONLY and Very MINOR problem was that we had forgotten our little alarm clock and when we asked for a 6am call, (to catch a train to go sightseeing) we were informed the telephone connection in our allocated room was broken, and at that time in the morning when the breakfast staff are arriving, we could not be guaranteed a knock on the door, (which we never got) good job we woke up anyway.As with any place (even at home), you get groups gathering on corners, which was not a problem for us, as we thought we were lost on our first night ,and ended up having a laugh and joke with a group of lads and girls, (on a street corner) when we asked for directions because we were facing our street. (we did not know where we were) haha.Hope this helps with your decision in going to this hotel.We did not pay much, so we got what we paid for (cheap an cheerful, with every amenity (what we needed) PLUS more than what we expected (after reading all these other reviews).All in all u get what u pay for in life, so when it does not cost you much (or is extremely cheap, or a bargain) it normally is, SO do NOT expect THE RITZ.They are trying to do their best.AND their best was what we needed in a city at that time ( a week before Christmas).It was good for shopping.Reviews

<Content>What A Nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Where do I begin? I am very disappointed to say the least. Our 鈥榣ong weekend鈥?break turned out to be the holiday from hell!Initially we (me and my girlfriend) were about to cancel due to the terrible reviews of thefts, rude staff, noise, etc. However, having spoke to our travel representative we were assured all would be ok.During our first day there were some strange occurrences in our room on our return after having been out for a meal e.g. we found hairs in the bath that didn鈥檛 belong to either of us, footprints in the bathroom, open windows, etc. We didn鈥檛 report the incidents as none of our belongings had been tampered with or stolen. As a precautionary measure we decided to get a safe for peace of mind.All seemed well until our return to the hotel on the second night. After a night out me and my girlfriend inadvertently realized that misplaced the room key. Upon asking for a spare at reception we were asked our room number. When we confirmed our room number we were welcomed with what I can only describe a tirade of verbal abuse. The gentleman at reception in broken English said we must leave immediately! Obviously we were very confused. When we asked why we were told that it was due to excessive noise coming from our room. He was not in the slightest interested in the fact that we had been out all night and the noise must have been coming from one of the adjoining rooms 鈥?not ours! He kept on shouting 鈥測ou must leave鈥?鈥測ou must leave鈥? We decided to leave (in hindsight we should have stayed and called the police) and resolve the issue by speaking to the manager first thing the following morning. As a consequence we found ourselves trawling the streets with our entire luggage in the early hours of the morning. To make matters worse the neighborhood was what I can only describe as very dangerous. At one point we were being followed by 4 men. Eventually we found a hotel (Hotel Mileni) costing 拢90 per night. We had no choice but to accept. Needless to say my girlfriend was terrified by the whole experience.The next morning we went back to Hotel Espana in order to speak to the manager in order to obtain an explanation. We were told the manager was unavailable (even via phone). It was a different person on reception. He too told us the level of noise was unacceptable. He was totally disinterested in the fact that we were out and we were receiving the blame unnecessarily.We decided had no option than to report to the police. After waiting for an hour to be seen we were redirected to another police station. At the second police station we were told that it was not a police matter as any theft or violence had not occurred. We went back to Hotel Espana requesting a refund, we were told to take it up with our travel agent. This wasted almost an entire day in our 3 day trip! We had no choice other than to check back into the hotel where we had spent the previous night.All the above said Barcelona is a beautiful city and we would definitely visit again 鈥?but not stay at Esapana hotel!

<Content>Loved it! We stayed at the Hotel Espana from 26th Feb to 1st march 07 and would definitely stay there again. I dont know what all the fuss is about in the previous reviews - you get what you pay for! Ok, so the bedrooms arent exactly luxurious, but they're clean and spacious. As we had gone to see Barcelona, not the inside of a hotel bedroom, that suited us just fine. As for the staff, they were all very friendly and helpful. After reading the reviews about room theft,we made sure we took all passorts  valuables with us each day, and kept anything else locked in our suitcases - no problem at all! Tobe honest, I would do that anyway, whichever hotel I was staying in. The hotel is right in the middle of the old 'red light district', so I was fully prepared for the shady characters that could be loitering, but we had no problem at all. Fantastic location - right slap bang in the middle of the Ramblas and close to everything we went there to see - couldn't have been better placed. I have stayed in far shabbier so-called 3* Hotels in London, and been charged twice as much for the privilage. Places like this are what you make them -enjoy!!

<Content>best hotel eva ... 4 a skl trip !! x well... this hotel is amazing, i visited it in early february around about the 5th. When we first turned up in the reception areas there was a horrible smell of fish but that was the only negative thing about it. Every day there would be a different type of smell. The hotel rooms were basic nothing grand or anything. The other bad things were the bathrooms they were alright except for our room which had 4 people in... well our bath had 3 holes in and if you had a shower it would flood the whole bathroom which was alright for a school trip because it was a laugh. Well the cleaners .. all i can say is keep an eye on them because they didnt steal anything from me or my friends but they weren't welcoming or nice. but the rooms had balconys which were fun ! and at night you would hear people running around the place... i dnt no who that could have been but over all i do recommend going there if your on a school trip but not otherwise. We only went for 3 days but it was the most fun in my life !! ooo yer and the doors lock really easily just to warn you !! Some girls on my school trip got locked out of their rooms at half past 3 in the morning and they were in their pjs and had white face masks on although this was highly amusing i would say be careful because not all of the rooms had spare keys... so... once your out dats it !! anyway the hotel was great !! and i would love to go back there wid ma mates. I would recommend it !! x

<Content>An historical hotel which is in the middle of the heart of Barcelona. An historical hotel which is in the middle of the heart of Barcelona. (Las Ramblas)My wife and me have stayed there 3 days and I can NOT write something bad about this Hotel except one day the charlady forgot our room door to close after cleaning and the door was all day long open for unwanted guests, but thank god.! Nothing happened...We had a delicious breakfast for an inexpensive Hotel, that was another positive point for us.It' s an historical hotel which is even remarked as a must be seen location in the booklet of Barcelona City.We recommend the Hotel to the people who concern to stay and remind you not to leave your valuable properties and your money in your room. Nobody knows.! We believe that you will have an outstanding visit of Barcelona city during your time at this Hotel.

<Content>Money  Where to start!!??We booked into the hotel on the 01/12, no mention of safe's were ever made to us, we were a party of 10 ladies aged between 28 and early 60's, some of us had been the year before and had no real problems.I was staying in room 301, our room was basic, but clean, ok could of done with some touching up but generally good for the price and the location.As we got up on the Sunday morning (03/12) my mother noticed that the wallet she kept her passport in, which was in her case under her bed (locked in the room etc etc) was open and her passport was gone, my sister's money that was Inside her passport was also gone, however her passport was left.Immediatly we searched our room, then made our way downstairs to reception.Waste of time.All we were told is to go to the police, nobody ever came to our room, or seemed the least suprised or concerned with what had happened, we were sent to the wrong police station, and it took 3 hours to get a letter that would get my mother through passport control and home.IF you decide to stay here, do not leave anything of any value in the room EVER.A lovely french lady was crying in reception later in the day as same thing had happened to her....Stolen to order in my opinion.

<Content>'THEFT' I have only just returned from my stay at this Hotel. Warning:DO NOT STAY THERE! Three of my rings and my mp3 player were robbed. I told reception, they didn't seem bothered at all. I have written an email to them today, I doubt I will get a reply. This is a very basic hotel. It also has a bad smell in it and no safes.If you do go take all your personal belongings with you whenever you leave the room.

<Content>theft of passport We stayed in this hotel last year in july with no problems at all but went again on 1st dec and had a terrible time, with a party of 10 women gone for a shopping trip we arrived with no safe offerded to any of us having 2 double and 2 triple rooms no good really.Went out friday night and came back to find one of the triple rooms door opened but nothing had been moved then went out again saturday night came back everything seemed ok until the morning when we all started packing the other triple room had had some visitors while we were out the night before and had taken a passport and several hundred pounds of cash no evidence of the door been forced in anyway. Went to reception to tell them and didnt seem in the slightest bit concerned was sent to the police station when arrived there they had sent us to the gaurdia instead of the policia when arrived back was told by 2 other couples that they themselves had also had items taken from their room and this happened the same night as ourselves.Not happy with the management nobody came to the room to see if we were ok, to help or check room all we kept been told was to go to the police.We obtained a letter from the police that was enough to get us home.Advice - Get a safe or keep valuables with you as possible keys are copied.

<Content>the only good thing is the location this hotel is really awful, the room was very small and poor. You can easily open the door without the key, so we decided to took every kind of personal belongings with us. It is allocated near the ramblas, but the taxi driver told us to be careful because it was an unsafe street (indeed, we didn't have any kind of problem). Breakfast is not very good because there's not so much choice.

<Content>Great historuc hotel Take no notice of those few bad reviews (i e the one headed  worse than beruit which says it was ok but...etc) If you are a fussy traveller - stay at home its safer ! Go and enjoy this hotel. A group of us (5) stayed a long weekend to celebrate my impending wedding. We are all experienced travellers and were pleasantly suprised to find an old ornate hotel, friendly and helpful staff. The rooms had powerful airconditioning and a large ensuite bathroom . The rooms differ so ask before you travel. Fantastic old atrium. A great position for Las Ramblas etc (watch out for the lady birds or whatever they are. if you are a couple or mixed group you will be ok anyway)All in all a great experienceSW

<Content>A great hotel in need of refurbishment We travelled to Barcelona in September 2006 and stayed in this lovely old hotel built in 1900. Unfortunately many of the rooms have not been re-furbished since we guessed the 1950s. Our first room was on a beautiful but vertigo inducing landing (see photo). This had a bare striplight and switch in the bathroom - very dangerous! We asked to move and were given a much better room in a refurbished (1980s) part of the hotel which was much better.Overall the rooms were clean and tidy,with no evidence of the cockroaches or noise mentioned by others in their reviews. We would, however, not go there again, preferring to spend a few more euros for something better. This is definitely a LOW BUDGET HOTEL. The area is fine being next to the Liceu opera house and right in the centre of the Ramblas - the best street in Barcelona. But beware rampant pickpocketing. We had a purse stolen from a handbag - luckily containing only 35 euros.Tip: on your first day buy a Bus Touristic ticket. This hop-on hop-off service goes to every site of interest every few minutes. A bargain.Prices are high in the main tourist streets: 2 cokes=13 euros! But take one step off the main Ramblas and prices halve and quality goes up. Our best restaurant was La Fonda, Carrer dels Escudellers just off the Ramblas - 30 euros for 2 people, 2 courses, wine, coffee - stunning food, brilliantly cooked with well judged sauces. Smaller bars provided good fresh lunches for 15 euros for 2.Good trip!

<Content>Loved It! I stayed in The Hotel Espana in June this year and really enjoyed it. It wasn't the best hotel but the location was second to none right on the ramblas and close to shops, bars and restaurants. I visited Barcelona on a school trip and thought that the hotel was great as we had everything we needed by our hotel without wandering around the city!

<Content>Quaint hotel It was our silver wedding anniversary and as we are not into parties we decided to go on a weekend break to Barcelona. I booked a city break with flyglobespan and chose the Espana as our hotel. After reading all the previous comments prior to our visit last weekend, we were a bit apprehensive. It didn't auger well when we first saw the hotel down a side street from Las Ramblas, but as soon as we set foot inside the front door we knew we'd made the right choice. The foyer and dining rooms were a throwback to it's obviously better days but were still very impressive. Our room on the 3rd floor looked onto an inner courtyard and was very peaceful, just as we wanted. The room was spotless, as was the bathroom. Clean bed linen and towels on both days we were there. The continental buffet breakfast was self service and set you up for a heavy days sightseeing. The staff were very friendly and helpful and I can't think of anything bad to say against it. It's location is very central and has good access to Las Ramblas (a must see!) and also Playa Catalunya where the tour buses leave from. The airport bus also leaves from here and you can catch a train to the airport as well.My wife and I agreed that we will definitely go back to Barcelona for a short break (3 days is long enough in a city that hardly ever sleeps!) and that the Espana hotel will be where we will be staying.

<Content>lovely the lobby and dining rooms are enchanting. beautifully decorated and hark back to a more affluent age in the hotel's histry. the staff were friendly, spoke excellent english as well as german, french and, I think, italian. this hotel is worth a visit just to look at the dining room which is huge and beautiful. OK, the rooms are a bit basic but don't forget this is a 2 star hotel. And anyway, who goes on holiday to spend the day in their hotel room?the hotel is litery 45 seconds walk to the main city centre. excellent location woith places to eat, shop and take in the atmosphere. and only 5 minutes from the posts and beach.we had a gret time.dave watts cambridge

<Content>Lots of character, but Hotel Espa帽a is very lovely, and the modernista interior is absolutely magnificent. It feels a bit like staying in an old mansion or hotel from the 18OO's. Breakfast was OK. The rooms are small and not that great. But the beds are good and you can wash yourself properly, so what more do you need. BUT. First of alI I would strongly advise you to keep your wallet, handbag etc. on your body at all time. My mom's handbag got stolen in the breakfast room. Secondly, do not trust the people at the desk, because one of them let the thieves in. They supposedly wanted to use the restroom. But afterwards he told us they were bad people, so why did he let them in. Plus they had to walk pass the desk and through a second door to get to the breakfast room. He should have noticed that. And none of the staff were very helpful afterwards. We didn't see a manager or anything. They couldn't care less.

<Content>Hit  We went to Barcelona for a 21st birthday.We had a studio room with 4 people sharing. Initially the room looked habitable - however, it was infested with COCKROACHES.We literally had to sleep all 3 nights with the lights on as once we switched the lights off more creepy crawlies would enter the room! As well as this the hotel was very noisy - with the cleaners dragging their cleaning trolleys up and down the corridors at 5am!!!Despite this or maybe because of this we hardly stayed in the hotel. The location was fantastic - about 30 seconds from the main strip of la rambla. The metro is very close by too. It is also located a short distance from placa la catalunya and in the opposite direction - port olyimpique. Barcalona is fantastic - and this hotel is cheap for a central location!

<Content>Beautiful, clean place in heart of Barcelona We stayed at the Hotel Espana for five days in May and were very happy, especially with the friendly people at the reception. Yes, we also got a strange room at first: it was situated in the centre of the hotel and looked out on the patio which didn't give us much privacy but when we asked for another room, it was no problem and we got a nice room in the front. Breakfast is not very special indeed, but look at the room you are having it in! It's FANTASTIC. I believe the hotelrooms in Hotel Espana need a makeover and when that's finished, it will be a four star hotel. Don't forget it's a two-star hotel at the moment.

<Content>I couldn't wait to leave My husband and I stayed here four nights--all I can say is don麓t do it. We had a tiny room next to an air shaft which smelled bad all day and night. The management refused to do anything about the shouting and screaming and running around at all hours of the night by students and drunken visitors. Yes - the breakfast is worth about $2. The hotel was overpriced and so what if it麓s five minutes from the Ramblas. It麓s still not worth half what it costs to stay there.One good thing - the people at the desk are polite.

<Content>Not recommended... We stayed at the Espana in December for one night and would not return. The public rooms (reception, breakfast room etc) are very attractive, but the room we were allocated was more like a cell. Although clean, the room itself was furnished with only a bed, small table and a chair. The closet was a cupboard in the wall in which the plaster was crumbling and the door to the room did not seem at all secure. The bathroom, whilst again generally clean, was very dated,had a mildewed shower curtain and was basically in need of an overhaul. Additionally, despite ceiling to floor curtains, the window was approx. 2 feet square, with no view, so the room was also rather dark and dingy-looking. Whilst the location is good (2 mins off Las Ramblas) I would sacrifice a slightly longer walk for a better room. We didn't like the look of breakfast so went to the famous Escriba bakery on Las Ramblas for breakfast and for a similar price received both good service and lovely food. Barcelona itself was great but look for a better hotel.

<Content>Poor We stayed at the Espana in October with a group of friends. All our rooms were scattered on different floors across the hotel, so not suitable for families who need to be together. Our friends rooms were reasonable (though one of them found a small cockroach), ours however was terrible. The door appeared to be made out of a plank of wood with holes in, one good kick and anyone could have got into it. The bathroom door locked itself several times and the receptionists solution was to give my boyfriend a paperclip to try and unlock it himself. The rooms were fairly clean, however the walls were very thin and you could hear everything that was happening outside, people yelling, doors slamming etc. When we left the hotel the manager tried to charge me and my friends (10 of us) for breakfasts we never had! he insisited that all 10 of us had had breakfast in the hotel and that we had to pay for it, he even called a waitress over who apparantly agreed with him (she was speaking in spanish though so she could have been saying anything!) They also showed us lists of room numbers who had had breakfast and our numbers were scribbled at the bottom. I didn't understand how they convinently had all of our room numbers mistaken for having breakfast. I wouldnt stay there again, Barcelona however was great!

<Content>Don't stay here I stayed at this hotel with my family around New Year麓s. It was nice enough at first, except the showers did not work in either of our two rooms. When you turned it on it would be scalding hot so you could only have it on cold and you麓d have to wait about 10 minutes for the temperature to be ok only to have it suddenly turn freezing. Worst shower experience of my life. Then we found a cockroach in our room! After throwing the trashbin over it we went to the receptionist who was extremely rude and tried to blame us for somehow bringing it in off the street which makes no sense at all (especially since there was no food in the room). He then pulled out a can of bug killing spray, which he had ready behind the desk (does this happen often?), and gave it to us as his solution to the problem. Later that night we found a baby cockroach in the bathroom. I had a terrible experience at this hotel. Unless you want a rude staff and bug infested room, do not stay at this hotel!!

<Content>Generally a nice little hotel We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of December. The hotel was easy to find and was in a fantastic location - literally just off the Ramblas. Check in was no problem and our room was clean and tidy. Our main problem was that we had no cold water in our bathroom which meant that having a bath or shower was impossible without scalding yourself - it was literally piping hot! We ended up having to run half a bath of water, leaving it to cool down over night and then topping it up with hot water in the morning! We did tell the reception about this but nothing was done about it during our stay. The bathroom looked good but the quality of the fittings wasn't so great - the toilet flush was so lose that it looked like it could come off at any time and the same for the bath taps. Breakfast was adequate and all food appeared to be fresh.Would probable stay there again if they sorted the water situation out - not sure whether it was just our room or a general situation.Worth staying there if you have a strict budget.

<Content>OK for the money but wouldn't stay again I stayed here with my husband and we were not very impressed with this place. The room was small and smelled bad, we were very happy that we packed a candle. The hotel itself was very noisy and the staff was only so so. The only good part was that it was right off the Rambla so it was very convenient. I would rather pay a little more money and avoid the smell and noise.

<Content>Never again Historic hotel on a central location just of the Ramblas. Very impressing modernista interior with a superb dining room, but the rooms are not in the same league. Small rooms, worn down, but worst of all: not clean. Although they clean the rooms every day they cannot prevent the cockroaches from creeping in! When confronting the receptionist with this problem he routinely gave us the insecticide from under the desk. Helpful yes, but never again I will stay at this place.

<Content>Yes, the breakfast is horrible Get over the cheap breakfast of a stale croissant and a cup of coffee. Skip it. Lots of good places in the neighborhood for coffee. The hotel is very old, once very grand, and now sits is sad, reminiscent splendor. But, it has a quirky charm, a very nice front desk staff, fun main floor architecture and comfortable if spartan rooms. It is a very good value in the best location you could want in Barcelona ---down a wide alley that never appeared the slightest threatening. And, it is located directly in back of the opera house which is worth a tour. All the other Ramblas sights are right on top of you. We did not encounter noise from young adult groups, but that can happen with any value hotel. We liked it enough to return this Fall. Cheap and fun if a bit basic upstairs, the Espana is a place for people who still value flavor and experience over one more dreary chain hotel box.

<Content>Central but very noisy The hotel Espana looks glorious when you walk in. The murals in the dining rooms and reception are historic, and the tiled floors and sweeping staircases give it a grand look. The reception is spacious and comfortable with seating areas. However, once you head upstairs it changes. My room was had two single beds. The room was very basic but reasonable. The attached private bathroom was lovely, with bright lighting, tiling and a combined bath and shower, and lots of shelving space. The corridors and landings upstairs were faded and definitely in need of an uplift. The staff were formal but friendly. Some spoke English. I forgot to bring my travel alarm clock. I asked for a wake up call twice and didn't get it on either morning. Breakfast is continental and fairly poor quality. The really big problem here is large groups of schoolkids. There was a very large group of teenagers staying. Throughout most of the nights, they banged on each others room doors, slammed doors, shouted and ran riot in the corridors. Other group members tried speaking to their teachers and complaining to reception staff, but nothing was done. The hotel is very centrally located, only a few minutes from the Ramblas and many Barcelona attractions and the best shopping are only a short walk away. The Metro is also very close by. I recommend this hotel for students, young people, school groups and couples, but not for anyone wanting a quiet space from the noise and bustle of Barcelona.

<Content>Great location, a refuge from the bustle . . . This hotel must have been splendid in it's heyday - now a faded monument to it's once oplulent past. A really interesting place to stay though, much better than some nondescript modern affair. Our room was fairly sparse, but very clean. It had a TV, big bathroom and comfy beds. What more do you need for a base to explore Barcelona? Nearest tube station 2 mins away; surrounded by places to eat, within a short walking distance of the beach/harbour area  central town. Check out the beautiful theatre next door; well worth a guided tour. Very tranquil inside, a real haven from the bustle of the streets. To sum up:excellent value; we'd definately stay there again . . . .

<Content>nice but dim the hotel is excellently placed 50m from Las Ramblasalthough the foyer and dining rooms are grand, the top floor (4th floor) room we stayed in was small and 'pokey' - BUT was fine and clean for a short city breakThe room was cleaned every day and new towels left.note: there were NO electical sockets in the room...which was a problem fo my wife and her hair driers/straighteners/curlers etc.the room has a large ceiling fan which was good enough to keep the heat down at night, whilst 'air-con' was also fitted and useful during afternoon naps ;^)Staff were all courteous, polite and friendly

<Content>fab location Smooth was the best way to describe the hotel. Room was small but for 2 days it was fine. Location 2/3 way along the ramblas was smashing. Eat off ramblas for a little touch of local hospitality. If you are using the open top buses worth nipping up to plaza de catalunya. If you want to visit sagrada familia its worth just grabbing any seat you can. After that getting upstairs wont be a problem. If you do find the very small HM head to the back an see a real cocoa/coffee shop in action. Chocolate 'n' churros is just the biz on a lazy afternoon.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised We have just got back from fantastic Barcelona. We where all extremley surprised at this very reasonably priced Hotel. Was not expecting anything special for the price, though reviews had been fairly good. The 2 rooms me and friends had where spotlessley clean (119  120 ) I thought they where more than adequate, Air Conditioning, Shower  Bath, t.v. Safe, Hairdryer and clean and very comfortable beds. The maid came every day and cleaned very well and changed towels. We heard very little noise only from people coming in at night and it wasn't anything significant, we heard nothing from the rooms next door or from above and I usually wake if there is any noise. I don't know what other reviewers mean about thin walls or floors? The Hotel Staff where friendly though I agree some spoke very little English but you'll find that in many places in Barcelona, there was usally 2 staff on and one who spoke English so wasn't usually a problem. The Location could not of been better just 2 minutes walk from The Rambles and the nearest Metro, 10 minute walk from the sea and harbour and 10 minutes from Placa de Catalunya where you'll find Bus Turistic (the brilliant Tour Bus) and the main shopping streets go off from here. Overall I would definetley go back to Hotel Espanya and reccomend it to anyone, do not be put off.

<Content>Didn't love it We stayed at this hotel May 17th-19th and probably wouldn't stay again. Although it was generally clean, affordable and in a convenient location, there certainly were some negatives. When we arrived (in the evening) the hotel staff spoke about 3 words of English, but with my broken Spanish and his 3 words we managed to get checked in. My husband and I were a little surprised when we opened the door and found 3 twin (single) beds in the room. Although we've been married ten years now, we do still prefer to sleep in the same bed. The room had a terrible odor which we discovered was coming up from the plumbing, so if you leave the room at anytime we found it helpful to make sure that all the drains are plugged up, this reduced the foul smells significantly. We have done a lot of traveling and have stayed in alot of hotel rooms, but this hotel must have the thinnest walls ever known! We could litterally hear EVERYTHING going on in the room next to us and above us. People brushing their teeth, full conversations, I mean EVERYTHING. It was like you were in the same room. So all that being said, yes, we got a great room rate, the location is very convenient, but next time we'd pay a bit more and stay someplace else.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Stayed here two nights 3rd May, loved this hotel, really traditional, spotlessly clean and the reception staff are the friendliest I have come across, ok the room was tiny but we were only there 48hrs, the bathroom was great quality, didn't samplethe food though so can't comment on that but the other visitors seemed to appreciate it.The hotel is in a great situation very convenient for all attractions, don't go to Barcelona for a relaxing holiday though there are too many sights to see, must reccommend the open top buses to see everything in the city excellent value for money,would definetly recommend this hotel for a short break, you can't go wrong!!

<Content>Great location We stayed at this hotel 27th to 30th April 2005 and I was quite apprehensive about staying there after reading other people's reviews, but when we arrived we were really surprised. The hotel had a lovely reception area and restaurant. The room we stayed in was very basic, but it was very clean and had a lovely size bathroom. We found the staff at the hotel very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is excellent, we couldn't of picked a better spot and the alleyway to the hotel is not that bad at all. I was expecting something a lot worse. The alleyway/street is always busy with people walking up and down it at all times so its nothing to worry about at all. I would definately recommend this hotel, so long as you were prepared for a basic room. We would definately go back there again!!

<Content>Very convenient, right in the middle Pleasantly surprised, very convenient and right in the middle of the action. Stayed from 25th-29th April. Street was not very inviting but inside hotel was. The decor was exquisite. We found a friendly and helpful staff. We had room 222 which was clean and spacious. It was at the front. There was limited noise, but the window across the street was facing you. That building was deserted with only a mobile phone shop at ground level.There was a safe in the room which needed a key, available with a returnable deposit. As we had arrived late we ate a very pleasant meal among the decor of the dining room. The receptionist stamped our photocopied picture page from our passports which later helped when obtaining an audioguide at Casa Mila. Here they only needed one copy. When buying an audioguide ticket no one said that ID was needed. It does say on the ticket audioguide service available with ID card, passport or drivers license That may be too late to find out. The hotel used room 103 to store luggage and got us a taxi to the airport. The taxi arrived at the door and cost 28 euros. The taxi from the airport to the street of the hotel cost 21 euros. The tabac near the ramblas opening sells stamps. Shower gel and shampoo was not renewed in the room. I would recommend the hotel for its convenience to the Ramblas and the Gotic area.

<Content>Would not stay again. We stayed 5 nights in April. The alley it is on isn't that nice but it is close to Las Ramblas. It was a little noisy Tues through Fri night and very noisy Saturday night. On the weekend the place seemed to fill with very noisy people (in the lobby and out in the alley) who proceeded to party all night long. The price was high (3 star price for a 2 star hotel).

<Content>Barcelona 2 Chelsea 1 Stayed here for 3 nights from when Chelsea lost, english fans a bit too load on that night, quiet rest of stay. Hotel is worth a visit for the location and its architecture and inside decor,Amazing. Our room 110 very basic in corner of quadrangle. There was a strange smell in the hotel and especilay in the area of our friends room118 (drains??) Brakfast OK but no ham or cheese ??as with most cont. brkfst. No coffee available when rest. closed. not sure if you would get one when open. Vending machines for cokes and beer. Had to 'persuide' night porter to open sitting room so we could play cards on night. On the whole if you want somthing very central and easy access to metro and Rambles this is an OK place but just don't expect too much.

<Content>Basic but definitely good value Stayed in this hotel in January 2005. Don't be put off by the 'cut-throat' alley leading to the hotel. The hotel itself is basic but clean and comfortable. The place gives the impression of being a bit old fashioned, but it has charm and character! The rooms, beds etc were clean, warm, comfortable (inc air conditioning if needed). Bathroom also clean with a good supply of hot water. We were in a room at the back of the hotel so it was very quiet. Given its very central location (Las Ramblas and right next to Liceu Metro) and the low cost, no complaints. p.s. the lift is new and trouble-free!

<Content>Ok, but lock up valuables We stayed there in early Jan 2005. Superb location, clean but simple room; affordable and very well placed for metro access. But on the second day a pair of sunglasses went missing from a table (we kept money and passports locked up in our luggage). We reported it to the management and the glasses were returned the next day. The story was that a cleaner 'found them in the waste bin' and thought it would be a shame to throw away good glasses. What was not explained was how the glasses moved from the table in the main room into a bin in the bathroom. Apart from that incident we were delighted with the place and have recommended it to friends. Both rooms that we had had a small safe in the closet (but no hangers).

<Content>Very good value We stayed at this hotel from Dec 14 to Dec 19 2004. We've greatly appreciated this hotel since it is conveniently located 2 minutes walking distance from a subway station and since it is located on a quiet street very close to the main pedestrial street of Barcelona, the Ramblas. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and it's close to the city center and main attractions. The room was clean, comfortable and a very good value given the price and location. Now, a single negative remark about this hotel: rooms which have their window in the inner courtyard suffer from odors which seem to come from the kitchen exhaust fan. But, all this to say, we would go back to this hotel without a doubt.

<Content>Great value in the winter !!! I always stay at Hotel Espana during January, because of their promotional rate during low season... in fact I am flying tomorrow and look forward to it. I find it too pricey in the summer 100 EUR inkl. breakfast. During high season I stay at Hostal Opera which is just across Hotel Espana. They have the same rate of 55 EUR for a double all year round, but I would only recommend it in the summer because of their location and price. But in the winter you find better deals with Hotels.The double is 50 EUR excl. breakfast during low season. Search the internet for deals. If you book directly through the hotel, they offer 65 EUR inkl breakfast. Dont take advantage of the breakfast they offer, it is not good (all prepackaged). You can get a coffee and croissant every where else for 2.50 eur. But thats the only negative thing that I can say about this hotel.Top Hotel floor is used by students who study in Barcelona. So I recommend that you ask for an exterior room on the first or second floor. But keep in mind two things: Barcelona is a bit noisy, this is just something that you must accept. And walls are thin. Also interior rooms maybe quiter, but I would never opt for it, because they are dark!!!Rooms are charming and clean, bath room is very spacious, which you dont find often in Barcelona.Staff is friendly and speaks English. Night staff does not, but this is not a problem.They have an excellent restaurant, you just never see too many people in there.But the biggest advantage is the location!!!! There is not better one. You are right where you want to be (Las Ramblas and Boqueria market, across the Gothic Quarter and main shopping area) and still in a quieter side street. In the back is El Raval, which looks a bit seedy, but they are slowly cleaning it up and already is very hip with many bars. However, at night I would suggest that you never walk alone. Also, watch your purse, especially in the summer this is a big problem!!!! Be aware near the Picasso Museum, many many signs that say Beware pickpockets. If you keep your eyes open, you can easily spot the guys who want to snatch your camera or money.I like Barcelona in January, nice weather (15-17 Celsius) and it is not as crowded as in the summer. Also they have the winter sale.

<Content>Good enough Stayed at Espana 17/12/04 20/12/04 nice and clean . Help yourself to breakfast have as much as you want. The only down side was you could hear people walking in the hotel late at night, but other than that very good.Also we paid 拢290 for 1 child and four adults which was excellent value for money.
