<Content>Lovely Hotel if a bit out of the way. When we first arrived we thought the Hotel was a little out of the way howevere with Trips to Old Tuscon and the Prima Air Museum it was ideally placed for both - and indeed for ventures into Scottsville.The Hotel appeared modern with nice rooms which were clean and airy. Breakfast was good with a reasonable choice.We certainly had no complaints and would stay again.

<Content>Very nice place I was in town to do some work at Intel and decided to stay at the Holiday Inn Express since they had a good Intel rate and because I would get Priority Club points. The hotel had been undergoing some renovations with more planned in the near future. The exterior of the hotel looked good and my room was large and clean. The wired Internet worked great and the bathroom was nice and clean. Breakfast was not spectacular, but good and even had a few hot items. The exercise room had several aerobic machines (including 2 treadmills) and all appeared to be working order. I did not make use of the pool and jacuzzi, but they looked very inviting. The staff was friendly and helpful. Several restaurants were within a 5-10 minute drive and there was a Cracker Barrel just down the driveway from the hotel. I would stay again if I return to Chandler.

<Content>Quiet Hotel and Great Staff In January 2007, my husband and I dared to travel to Arizona with our 19 month old twins. On January 15th we stayed here in Chandler. The front desk was informative, polite and gave us an upgrade for free! I couldn't complain about that! The room had a nice view over the outdoor pool, plenty of space for our little ones to run around, very nice bed. That night, my daughter got an upset stomach and was up most of the night. At checkout the staff was awesome with the problems that had occurred and were completely understood.

<Content>Ok, but not the Ritz I was a guest at the hotel during the LSJ Driver Development Program in Chandler AZ. The staff was accomodating and the rate was pretty fair for the area. The room was adequate, but nothing spectacular. The location is good, near other restaurants and easy access to Hwy 10 and airport. It's not the Ritz, but it is OK. The pool looked great, but we did not have time to use the facility. There is a laundry and also access to email using the front desk business center. Good staff, and friendly housekeeping, All in all -- OK.

<Content>Not Impressed We spent one night here and it was one night too many. I think there were probably nicer rooms in the motel but we were not lucky enough to receive one of those rooms. Our room had a one inch crack below the door....everything was old and dingy looking and it didn't feel clean. The bed was comfortable however, we slept out of pure exhaustion even over the highway noise. The pool area was nice and we enjoyed that very much. Next time coming into town we will make sure we know where we are going and will book ahead.Don't be fooled by the pretty lobby, or at least look to see the room you are being assigned. There are lots of nicer newer motels at the next exit west.
