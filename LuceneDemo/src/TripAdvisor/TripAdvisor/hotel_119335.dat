<Content>Good hotel for budget travelers Definitely this is a good choice for budget stays in the area. There are no other ones in the neighborhood that could hit the price of this.No breakfast is provided but they have coin laundry, pool, and in my room I had a fully equipped kitchen (microwave, refrigerator, stovetop...) Everything is clean and the staff is helpful. They have complimentary shuttle bus to and from the airport.

<Content>All rooms are not created equal at this hotel...read to the end We stayed here two nights in Oct 2004, once before we flew out to Mexico and also the evening of our return. The hotel allows you to park there for FREE while you are gone provided you stay at their hotel atleast one night. They also provide free shuttle service to and from the airport. Our room the first night was a queen-size and was sub-standard. Too small and the bed was hard and there was only one nightstand and lamp so the other person in the room could not read in bed. Rug was in shabby condition. Sofa was tiny. Not very nice at all. Upon our return we did not intend to stay, but were too tired once we got back to pick up our car. The front desk clerk was not the smilingest I have ever come across (and having been a motel manager for 23 years, I have seen a lot of them), but she was very helpful and went out of her way to find us the best rate available and this time we paid a bit more (see why below) but we also agreed to pay even $10.00 more on top of that to be upgraded to a king room, end unit which was much larger and nicer. Full size sofa this time. Bathrooms still small, but adequate for one night. Burnt out bulb in bedside table this time, but that was the only complaint about lighting, as there were two nightstand and two bedside lamps in this larger room. Carpet a bit better than the previous room. The rooms was so large it was equipped with two air conditioners which adequately cooled it quickly as the a/c had not been on when we arrived. Rates were reasonable both stays, but it seems the hotel was sold during the week we were away and new managment might greatly increase the prices (which is why the price was higher the second time as they had already raised them some) which would perhaps not make it such a desirable place to stay as what brought us to the hotel were the rates. The hotel has no restaurant but is two minutes driving away from an Applebee's and large shopping centre for those last minte holiday necessities - there was a Costco, Target, Ross and many, many more shops in the same shopping centre. Would recommend it if you request a king-room and the rates do not go too much higher. They DO give you a nice complimentary breakfast where you can even make your own waffles! Also nice, small kitchen area in the room which we did not use.
