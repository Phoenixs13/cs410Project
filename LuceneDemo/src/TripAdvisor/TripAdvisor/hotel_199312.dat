<Content>A very good stay Stayed for two nights on a business trip. The Hotel is next door to the FestHalle/Messe and close to the U-Bahn station which is one stop from the main train station. I got a taxi from the airport at a cost of 鈧?4.I paid 鈧?80 per night and got a room on the Executive (6th) floor. The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom was well equipped with toiletries, razor, toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc.There is an internet connection in the room via a network cable rather than wireless, cost 鈧?5 from 12 to 12 - too expensive in my view.Breakfast was great, a large selection and well presented - a good start to the day.Staff were friendly enough, I had no problems during my stay so cannot comment on how well they deal with problems.All in all a good stay and I would use this hotel again.

<Content>An excellent business hotel A company that invited me to FRT put me into this hotel for one night. I saw a number of negative reviews and felt leery, but figured - how bad can it be for one night. In the end - a very pleasant surprise. Very helpful staff (we asked to move to a room with a view, then to a room with a king bed), generous size room, everything worked flawlessly. The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 - they charged 15 euros for the internet for a day. Any hotel that charges such a thieving internet rate loses a star in my book! Otherwise the hotel was fine, and I would certainly go back if in FRT.

<Content>Not really nice I had to stay there for 6 nights for a business trip. The hotel was fully booked because of the music fair, and we paid a very expensive fair rate. 325,00 EuroThe room was ok, it was nothing special, it looked like all hotel rooms ind these kind of hotels but it was clean.The staff at the reception was very unfriendly, they lost the booking of our first night, and tried to blame us for that even we were holding the confirmation in our hands! There was no excuse, nothing.The breakfast was uneblievable good. A very big choice, including a japanese section! That was really a good start of the day.The staff at the restaurant lost our reservation one evenning, and this is of course a problem in a fully booked hotel. But they made it possible and were also kind and friendly. But - the food on the buffet was bad! The meat was so dry, we could not even chew it.The Highlight of this hotel beside the breakfast was definetly the Japanese Restaurant. The food was great, wonderful staff, perfect!

<Content>Good conference hotel - excellent breakfast selections Previous reviews are sort of on the mark but to be fair, this is a four star hotel with decent sized rooms and good conference facilities. For those of you not familiar with Frankfurt, the location is to the north-west of the main train station. You could get a cab from there (it would only take about 5 -8- minutes) or the U-Bahn (still a hike with the bags) but if you want to save money, you could also get the tram (nos. 16 or 17) which runs frequently. It is the closest hotel to the Messe (trade fair) and in fact shares part of the congress centre. Rooms are of a good size - there should be no complaints. Facilities are standard and include just about all the cable TV you could need (although no plasma screens in the Maritim chain yet to my knowledge), well stocked mini-bar and good bathrooms which were fully stocked with amenities. Breakfast was included in my rate and was outstanding - the selectionin the 'Ambiente' restaurant was almost overwhelming including cold meats/cheeses selection, eggs done four ways, full Japanese breakfast, fruits, breads and baked goods and so forth - service is generally prompt and to the point.A minor difficulty on checkout which was cleared up quickly but otherwise a good stay and certainly recommended for a stay in Frankfurt.

<Content>Functional with no frills Stayed at both the NH and the Arabella Sheraton and liked both for different reasons. One was very modern whilst the other had an old world charm about it. Plus the slippers they supplied were designed to fit a size 9 foot and above unlike most slippers supplied these days. Onto the Maritim, it is situated near the Messe U4 underground station. About 5 mins into the centre (Hauptwache) although the stop is ROMER. It takes about 20 - 30 minutes by foot. Like a previous reader, the nearest food places outside of the hotel are either by crossing to the Marriott opposite or wondering down to the central station or into town. The room for 鈧?75 has a double bed and is reasonably large. There is no broadband but ISDN?! Who uses ISDN!Toiletries are bog standard and minibar prices are fairly standard at 鈧? a beer. Having stayed in a Le Meridien in Munich and an Intercontinental in Vienna on the same business trip, the Maritim I'm afraid does not offer anything to make me want to stay here again.

<Content>Perfect for business During my frequent business travels to Frankfurt this is so far the best hotel I stayed at. The breakfast is unbelievable - including a Japanese section, there is a pool on the top floor, spacious rooms and good service. Direct access to the fairgrounds. Lobby can feel like an airport lobby when something is going on at the convention center. Central train station can be reached on foot if you have no luggage, although it is not such a nice walk.

<Content>Would definitely stay here again Nice spacious rooms, good location, close to the underground station, wonderful breakfast. Downside - no broadband and the Q bed in my room had a foam mattress. Paid 131 Euros including all taxes and breakfast, so it was excellent value and I would stay here again.

<Content>Beautiful Modern Hotel My husband and I just stayed at this hotel, and it was just wonderful. The staff was very nice and very helpful. If you stay there, you have to use the parking garage, under the hotel, but it does not belong to the hotel. You can pay your parking fee at the desk, when you check out, and it is 22Euros per day, but it is very safe and convenient. The standard room was very nice in size, and also very clean. Make sure that you put your Do not Disturb sign on the door, we were awakened at 9am with someone trying to get in and clean the room. The one problem that we ran into, that was not any fault of the hotel, there is NO-WHERE to eat in this area. We were going to the RUSH concert at the Festhalle (very conveniently located) and wanted to be finished with dinner by 6:30 pm. The resturants at the hotel didn't open for dinner until 6pm, so we ventured out into the streets looking for somewhere to eat. We walked around in both directions for about an hour and found nothing, finally we went back to the hotel and ate at the Bar/Lounge that is by the lobby(I think it was called Lifestyles). They told us that they had a small menu of snacks. It turned out to be a full meal of delicious food and the waitstaff was GREAT, they take very good care of you. Make sure that you are hungry in the morning, the Breakfast buffet could not be any better, they have everything that you could imagine eating, and more!! All in all, we loved this hotel, and highly recommend it.
