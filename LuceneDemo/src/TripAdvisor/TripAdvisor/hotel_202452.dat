<Content>Very rude Everything about this hotel was fine except for the front desk people. For some reason the man that checked me in and the man that checked me out were extremely rude. They never once smiled at me or tried to make me feel like a guest at a hotel. There were some problems with my stay and they never said sorry or tried to make anything better. I certainly didn't feel like I was at a hotel, more like I was at the DMV. I would never stay here again.

<Content>Good Value Hotel Quiet, spotlessly clean hotel, very quiet and really good value for money. We were staying to go to athletics at the Olympic Stadium which is 2 stops away on the S-Bann. 10 minute walk to Spandau which has a pretty old town - there was a wine festival on while we were there - lots of different German wines and some interesting (!) bands playing... Would stay again if in the area.

<Content>use the safe We have just returned from a week's stay at this hotel, good sized rooms and friendly staff. Hotel is about 25 minutes from central berlin by S-Bhan, the local rail system, which was probably at the limit for non car users. If you had a car there was plenty of parking and that would probably have been more convenient.The locality is quiet but the walk from the rail station to the hotel late at night did involve running the gauntlet of the local drunks who inhabit the park area between the station and the hotel. We took to going the long way round.The price per room was fair and the breakfast very reasonable at 7 euros per person. Lots of choice from the breakfast menu.The major downside was the loss of an MP3 player from the room. There is a safe in the room and my advice would be make sure you use it. We had 2 rooms and the room which suffered the loss was occupied by my 17year old daughter and her friend. When I made the manager aware of the loss the reaction was that this was a teenager and it would turn up. The following day the adaptor to the MP3 player was also taken from the room. The unit had a UK connection and would not work without the adaptor. This really made no sense as the cost of the adaptor is probably no more than 5 or 6 euros.I was more annoyed at the second loss as it seemed whoever had taken the item felt they could take something else with impunity. Unfortunately the reaction was very similar to the first loss. These incidents spoilt what would otherwise have been a very nice stay in a very nice hotel
