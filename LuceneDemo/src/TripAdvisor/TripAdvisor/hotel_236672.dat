<Content>A splendid little hotel,a home away from home Hotel Silvana is a small, welcoming, neat, clean and very comfortable hotel located in the heart of Frankfurt close to the Messe. The staff are friendly and helpful. It is my first choice in the city, if they have room, but they are frequently full.
