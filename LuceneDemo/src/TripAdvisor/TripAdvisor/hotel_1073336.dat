<Content>big rooms at the Orchard Grand Court Stayed at this hotel-style apartment for 4 nights. Location is in the Orchard Road vicinity (walk approx. 10 mins). An MRT (subway) station is close by. Check in was fast and efficient. The people at the concierge desk were very friendly  helpful (answered our questions etc.). The hotel room was huge, with 3 beds (one double and one single), a dresser, small round table with 2 chairs, big closet, safe, mini bar, coffee/tea maker. Bathroom is ok size with tub. Breakfast was included in our rate and was ok: very british (baked beans, toast, bacon, sausage, marmalade etc) or asian (porridge with condiments, chinese noodles etc.), also fresh fruit  juices, coffee/tea. Floor (carpet) was a bit dirty - crumbs etc. All in all a pleasant stay. Can recommend this hotel to people who don't want to spend a fortune, as most Singapore hotels are top class and thus quite expensive!
