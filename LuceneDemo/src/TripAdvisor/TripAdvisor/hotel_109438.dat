<Content>Enjoyed my stay My stay was comfortable and quiet. The hotel property is set up like an apartment complex. Parking isn't the greatest, it is first come first serve and you could be quite far from your room. This is not the best area. You will be right off the highway and not close to decent places to eat. However, there is a grocery and pharmacy a stones throw away. The rooms are small for suites, not normally what I've seen in a Residence Inn property. They look very nice when you first enter, it is only after opening the curtains and taking a good look that you do realize there is a lot of wear and tear.The staff was excellent and met every need. The breakfast bar in the morning had much more than what you would expect. Also, the managers special at night was a meal in itself. These two things alone were welcomed since the weather was icy and going out wasn't a fun alternative.I didn't use housekeeping as I only stayed two nights, and I never visited the laundry.All in all, yes the place could use a little work, but for the price and the things that did go right I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again or to recommend it to my business partners.

<Content>Quite possibly the worst Marriott property I have seen I was booked into this property - along with other colleagues - for a consulting project, and was unfortunate enough to stay there for several weeks.The property is not in a scenic spot, though it does have the asset of being in a relatively convenient area, as it is within a short drive to area shopping and other attractions.That being said, the whole lodging experience was a nightmare. The rooms were horribly filthy and incredibly small to truly be suites. One of my colleagues had a significant silverfish infestation, and the staff refused to move her to a different room, much less resolve the infestation. Others of us battled roaches and/or fire ants. The furniture, fixtures, and appliances were all in poor shape - if not outright broken. I personally became known as Mr. Fix-It, because I had several things break or fall off (such as the sliding door between the living area and bedroom) and was left to repair them myself, again because of staff indifference. Though these were billed as non-smoking suites, it was obvious from the strong residual odors on the furniture that smoking had occurred in the suites.The walls were also very thin, so noise from other rooms and outside were impossible to ignore. The property as a whole were equally filthy and in poor working condition. The laundry facilities were so dirty that there was little confidence that you were actually getting your clothes clean. The on-site pool facility was closed for the duration of our stay, though from appearances, I doubt any of us would have used it. As with other Residence Inn properties, there was a free breakfast service. But the food quality was terrible; the hot items were frequently lukewarm to cold and poor-tasting, and other items looked or tasted spoiled. The staff from management on down was horrendous. There was only one of the front desk staff - a nice lady named Betty - who actually seemed to care and who tried her best to make things right despite the circumstances. Beyond that, there was a complete and thorough lack of caring, responsiveness, or general customer service. The housekeeping staff did their jobs poorly, and several of us dealt with theft issues that we could only track to that staff. When - either individually or via our firm's owner - tried to resolve our many issues with the property management, we were largely ignored or otherwise told that nothing was wrong with their facility.After about six weeks, we all moved to another competing property about a mile away, which turned out to be an eminently better lodging experience than this property. We later learned that this Residence Inn served as temporary lodging for refugees from Hurricane Katrina. While that may have explained some of the disrepair, it was certainly no excuse for not making any strides towards resolving them or making right by their existing guests.Even being over a year removed from this lodging experience, I continue to be stunned at just how poor this facility was. As a Marriott Rewards member and frequent traveler, this was unquestionably the worst Marriott property I had ever been at. I am amazed that Marriott would even tolerate the condition of this property and would continue to have its banner on it. It is a detriment to their reputation for quality lodging.

<Content>Good, clean  Stayed here for 2 weeks. The room was very clean, though slightly worn in spots. The staff was excellent.The free breakfast was excellent, with a friendly staff.Right off the highway, so not a scenic spot, but convenient to most areas around Dallas.One thing I didn't like was in my room/suite, the TV could not be seen from the bed.

<Content>Consistent, Clean Stays I've had to stay in this area of Dallas 8 separate times over the past 6 months. After trying three other hotels, I've thankfully settled on the Residence Inn. It was exactly what I needed as a business traveler. Pros: Clean rooms. Consistent each time I stayed there (now 4 times in a row). Friendly employees. Slightly better than average hotel breakfast food selection. Cons: Slower than average free internet. No wifi in rooms, short ethernet cable provided, only one ethernet outlet in a two bedroom suite. I stayed in a third floor / top floor room and heard birds landing and taking off all night long. I'd like the hotel to install some type of anti-bird landing devices before I stay in a top floor room again.

<Content>Good Place to stay Stayed at the Residence Inn and it has a nice homey feel to it. I stayed at a 1 bedroom suite with balcony, a full kitchen and maid service. Rooms are clean and well maintained.Good for a families and business traveler. Currently undergoing renovations but did not hear any noise at all. Front desk are very helpful and friendly. Close to Presbyterian Hospital, the mall and restaurants. They have a free internet service at the lobby in case you need to print your boarding passes and browse the internet. Hot breakfast is served at the lobby from 7-10 am on weekends. Very accessible to US 75. A 30 min drive to DFW or less depending on traffic.

<Content>Very Comfortable I would respectfully disagree with the prior reviewer. I travel to Dallas several times a year on business and always stay here whenever possible. The rooms are the usual Residence Inn quality--spacious and homey. I have never heard any freeway noise at all. Most all Units do not face the Central X-way and are set back--noise was not an issue. I have never had an issue with mattress or pillows either. The location is great. Not far off the LBJ freeway with easy access to almost anywhere in the metroplex. I will stay here in the future and would definately recommend.

<Content>Noise  We stayed here on a Saturday night in Dec. of 2003...mainly for the location. All rooms of this hotel group are the same, so you know what you're getting. However, all mattresses ARE NOT the same. Ours was so uncomfortable, I actually left the king bed in the bedroom and tried to sleep on the sofa bed -- terrible! You expect a sofa bed mattress to be so-so, but you'd never expect a real bed to be this bad. I called to complain to the manager the next Monday morning, and was told by a staffer that I could have asked for a bed board to make it better...can you imagine?!!?? Plus, unless you are on the far side of the property away from Central Expressway, get ready for some major road noise! Unless you can sleep anywhere, forget it. It was like we had a bedroll on the shoulder of the freeway, and I'm not exaggerating that much. We have previously stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott right next door (literally shares the lot with the Residence Inn) and had a great mattress and quiet rooms. We should have stay there again, but opted for the included breakfast at Residence Inn. I would never recommend this place again if sleep is important to you.
