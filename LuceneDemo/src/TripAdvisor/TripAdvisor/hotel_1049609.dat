<Content>Hola Barceloneta! We have now stayed here twice with each occasion being for 2-3 months.The apartments here are great - their position couldn't be better : less than a minute's walk from the seafront and also only a 10 minute walk (along the marina) to reach the city centre.The owners were very friendly  helpful and the apartments were clean and nicely decorated with several of them newly renovated. They all have a free Wi-fi internet connection too and I'd say they're very good value for the money. A definite recommendation for anyone visiting BCN for a short or long stay.
