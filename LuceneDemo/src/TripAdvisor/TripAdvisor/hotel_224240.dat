<Content>Truly a "suite" experience During a consulting project in the Dallas area, me and several business colleagues moved to this property from perhaps the worst Marriott property in the world (just up the expressway). After that experience, any property would have been great, but the Bradford turned out to be a most welcome change for the remaining two months we were on this project.The suites we had had the feeling of apartments, and were largely quiet. I had a suite on the interior section, with windows facing the central pool/courtyard area. The suites were exceedingly spacious, with a nice living area, kitchen area, bedroom, and bathroom. Storage space was more than plentiful, which was good for long stays. There were TV's in both the living room and bedroom, though the cable options were a bit limited. There was a very basic VCR in the living room, which was a nice touch, but would be better utilized if it were a DVD player instead. The bed was a tad firm, but otherwise comfortable. Kitchen appliances and tools were ample, and allowed more flexibility for dining in. A nice feature of the suites were that the in-room phones had their own separate numbers with a voicemail inbox that could be set up with a personal greeting. This made it nice for people to contact you, as they did not have to go through the front desk to be transferred to your suite. The pool facilities were nice, though could get busy and noisy if a lot of kids were around. The fitness facility was small, but functional. The laundry facility was more than satisfactory and contained several washers and dryers, so it was near-impossible to ever have a wait to wash clothes. The facility was clean, safe, and secure. Room keycards were needed for access to the parking garage, and to enter the main doors in the overnight hours. The facility is in a safe area, within easy walking distance of a Tom Thumb grocery store, Barnes  Noble, restaurants, and the North Park Mall. It is also within easy driving distance of other area shopping and attractions. The front desk staff was helpful, if unspectacular, in their customer service. I did not have any encounters with the housekeeping staff, though they kept the suites clean and well-stocked. Another nice feature in regards to housekeeping is that the rooms were serviced twice a week, and the guest could customize the days that they wanted that service to occur.In my last couple of weeks at that property, they were beginning a renovation of some rooms and other parts of the facility. I have since learned that ownership of the property has changed. I hope that the good standards were maintained in this upgrade and change, because for the price and quality, this was a very good long-term stay facility in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

<Content>Excellent Facility This hotel is now the Hyatt summerfield in lincoln park. Excellent location to the north park mall and alot of restaurants. The actual hotel is very clean and new. happy hour daily 5:30 to 7, free beer and wine. complimentary breakfast and free in room internet. doesn't get better than this. Stayed at the double tree hilton the week before but I would recommend the hyatt, much better bang for your buck. Great hotel with a nice pool

<Content>Clean, Roomy but Noisy This property is scheduled to become a Hyatt hotel soon so the name will be changing. And when they were there, they were renovating the place making for a lot of noise during the daytime - even over the weekend - mixed with smell of fresh paint. That's probably temporary and travellers will benefit in the long run but it made for a stressful weekend.Walking to my room, the halls were wide, bright and clean but I heard someone walking in the hall on the floor above me. I wondered if this was a modular unit hotel. The room was large, nicely designed, well lit and had a cool flat screen TV that swirled from sitting area to the sleeping area. Kitchenette seemed to have everything - plates, cooking pans, etc.Food was average for the medium priced hotels that offer free hot breakfast - did not have protein everyday. The eggs were more like torillas stuffed with cheese - tasty if you didn't have to look at them. Rolls, cereal, bagels, breads, good selection of fruit, juice were available during the morning hours.The people were nice. One time I though the maid had forgotten to return the cleaned coffee pot to my unit. I mentioned it when passing the front desk. The night maid was there and she walked me up to the room to show me that it had just been in the in-room dish washer. It was cold, so I didn't swim in the outdoor pool. Internet stations were in the lobby with free Wired Internet in the room. It was a nice stay, except for the noise (and the pancake-eggs).

<Content>Good Hotel; Few Complaints This place was recently updated. Good location (make sure you map the nearby highway interchange and streets or you may get lost!) and the rooms have a nice kitchen, bathroom, sitting area and flat screen TV. Nice closet too. Breakfast is included and is pretty good. It's all neat and clean, if a tiny bit dark and dingy at times. Good value and nice staff. Near a nice mall and Blue Mesa Grill; you should eat there if you can.

<Author>SuiteCase
<Content>Would not return Our stay was comfortable because of the location, covered parking, full size refrigerator, quality pots/pans/dishes, and great service people that work there. The bed and bedding including the pillows were very uncomfortable, considering the Bradford Suites is touted as an upscale extended stay hotel. The bath room sink is a strange miniature size that I have never seen before making it uncomfortable to shave in. Also, the furniture was stained and well worn, definitely in need of replacement. The complimentary breakfast was very low grade quality, soggy-days old fruit, stale pig-in-blanket. The picture of the room on their website is nothing like the room you will get, so look around. I didn't know that you could post pictures here, so I'll make sure to post some tomorrow after we check out.We found a great place for half the price at the Candle Wood Suites. They don't have a breakfast or luxury lounge room but the rooms are nicer and more comfortable.

<Content>Great for business and budget travelers My wife and I stayed one night at this hotel after attending my nearby company Christmas party. Since we didn't feel like dropping over $200 for a night at the hotel of the party, I booked a night at the Bradford for a mere $99. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. Facilities were in great condition. The free attached parking garage was a plus since it was raining the night we checked in. Nice free continental breakfast buffet in the lobby the next morning.Our room had all the amenities you would need if you are a business traveler or someone in need of a cheap stay such as we were. Kitchenette, huge refrigerator, high speed internet, 100 TV channels, etc. Room was very clean. My only complaint that keeps me from giving it a 5 is that the bed was not that comfortable and the sheets felt like they were disposable and made of paper.

<Content>Nice Place Stayed one night to see a Stars Hockey Game. Hotel is located within walking distance of the American Airlines Sports Center. We found the room to be clean and very nice. There was a large HD flat screen TV available. There was a microwave, refrigerator, and electric stove top. The rooms looked to have been updated. There was some construction on the ground floor that did not bother us at all (we were on the 2nd floor). The only negative would be the breakfast which because of construction I believe was served on a tiny shelf. There were the usual rolls, juice, etc. Nothing really special but it was there. Would stay again if in Dallas.

<Content>Delightful Stay in Dallas We went to Dallas for a wedding and had three days and nights to enjoy Dallas. This hotel was an excellent choice because of the location and quality of the property. We usually stay at higher end hotels but this hotel met all of our expectations. We had our two small children with us therefore we were not going for romance, just fun and that is what we had on this trip. The children really enjoyed the hot-tub. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dallas.

<Content>Impressed! I recently stayed at The Bradford to attend a wedding in the area.The hotel exceeded my expectations! At first I was sceptical because there was no restaurant in the hotel, but the staff directed me to 2 restaurants around the corner. The Breakfast was really good, better than I expected. They had breakfast pizza's one day and breakfast burritos the next( in additional the the normal continental items.) We swam in the pool Saturday during the day and it was lovely- I even got a little tan to wear to the wedding! The staff was very nice and even remembered my name when I checked out. The room was very clean, and they had Bath and Body Works products in the bathroom(Loved it!). Bed was comfortable, and room was well kept. I was expecting a budget-type hotel, but this was SO much better. I felt like I was staying a a 4 star hotel. I will definately stay here if I go back to Dallas.

<Content>No phone service?!? I booked this hotel for out-of-town family - and the hotel will not answer their phones! I have called the number for two hours now. I confirmed the local phone number with the Bradford Homesuites national reservation number - they also attempted to call the hotel also with no success. My family members don't have a cell phone so I CAN'T GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM...Moreover, look at the hotel's web site - they don't even list a fax number for the hotel. This is simply unthinkable. I have no idea what has gone wrong with their switchboard/front desk clerk but it is amazingly frustrating and even a safety issue, I would think.

<Content>Great location This is a good location for people like us who need quick access to the SMU area. It's a good value, too. Agree with other reviewer that the wood blinds are nice, but allow daylight in a bit earlier than we wanted. Our suite was clean and comfortable. Liked the amenities in the small kitchen. Bed and bathroom were comfortable. However, the AC went out on day 2 and mgmt. did not fix. They moved us to a Handicapped accessible room (the only other room open). A hassle. While that room was well equipped for disabled, it was a lot smaller than our original suite and no effort was made to credit us. We would stay there again because of its location, covered and free parking and homey amenities.

<Content>Would be great, but..... This hotel is very conveniently located off 75, minutes from SMU, just around the corner from NorthPark Mall (which is HUGE! Bring your hiking boots) and a small shopping center with a Cheesecake Factory restaurant (recommended), Barnes and Noble, and grocery store. While the location was hard to beat, we will not be staying here again. There were good things about this hotel, and the price was reasonable, but the bad outweighed the good for us.Plusses: Our suite was immaculately clean and quiet, (no overuse of air-freshener); the bed was comfortable; the kitchen well-equipped; the service was friendly; parking was in a key-card secured garage connected to the building. The minuses: The wood blinds, while pretty, let in way too much light--- we were all up at the crack of dawn. I certainly wouldn't have been able to nap during the day. I just can't imagine hotels not having block-out curtains in their rooms nowadays. The breakfast buffet wasn't that great--- I've certainly seen better at hotels much cheaper than this.The Nintendo controller was in the bedroom portion of the suite. We had hoped to let our children play in the den area (where the fold-out couch was) while we watched TV in the bedroom. Not possible. And the pool---- it was FREEZING! And this was late September in Dallas! The highs all week had been in the 90s, but you couldn't even let your legs dangle in the water in the afternoon, that's how cold it was. The pool is in the center of the courtyard, blocked on all sides duing the day by the 4-story building, so it only gets direct sunlight for a few hours each day. Our children were extremely disappointed, as hanging out at pool was going to be a big part of our long weekend. I couldn't believe how cold it was. I'm not sure if it's heated at other times of the year, but it would HAVE to be, if it was this cold in September. You might want to check on this if you intend to swim. We wish we had--- this alone would have made a huge difference in our satisfaction with the hotel.So, in short, if you're not planning to swim, and are using this as a business hotel and have no intention of sleeping in, this hotel might be a fine choice for you. We will look elsewhere next time.

<Content>location, location, location We have stayed at the Bradford a number of times. We have been happy with facilities. The room was clean, the breakfast good (and usually available earlier than scheduled), and the staff friendly. The hotel location is good, too, near North Park Mall, right on Central Expressway and very near our daughter's apartment.This time, we had a room on the top floor in the corner overlooking the pool. There are other better locations. The pigeons were roosting on the ledge outside of the window and their cooing was a bit intrusive. Also, there must have been an ac unit above us as we heard it turn off with an audible bang throughout the stay..We would definitely stay at the Bradford again. We just will ask for a non corner room on a lower level.

<Content>Great Choice Again On a recent trip to visit family in Dallas, we stayed at the Bradford Suites at Lincoln Park. This was our third stay at this property. The hotel is right off the Central Expressway, so it is a breeze to get around, including SMU, downtown, North Park Mall, and the West Village.Central Market and Whole Foods are an easy 5-10 minute drive. The property has been very well-maintained. The rooms are clean and unlike many places in Texas do not have even a hint of mildew. Every room has a small kitchen, which is great for snacks and left-overs, but no table to eat at. The pool and hot tub are excellent - plenty of sunshine throughout the day. The breakfast is an extended Continental, with Starbuck's coffee, Panera's bagels and muffins, and plenty of other goodies. Parking is gated and key-card access only, with convenient hotel entry at each floor. Negatives are a lot of Central Expressway noise on the east side of property. Nothing of interest is within walking distance, including any restaurants. The hotel business center is weak, but in-room high-speed Internet access is free. The room price has steadily increased but there are weekend and Internet specials - so it is better to book directly online at the Bradford Suites webpage.

<Content>Enjoyed the stay This was our third time to the Bradford Homesuites Lincoln Park and our first time in a one bedroom accommodation. And, once again, we enjoyed our stay. The staff was very pleasant, the breakfast enjoyable and the bed comfortable. I do miss the nutragrain bars, though. I understand too many of them were wasted and they no longer have the complimentary bars in the kitchenette. Too bad. We will be staying here again!

<Content>Our favorite place Have stayed here several times over the last three years. Rates have been reasonable, secure covered free parking is a plus. Nice continental breakfast (need to add donuts!). This is where we regularly stay. Stayed there last month-- will be there again this month.

<Content>Very snobby for so-so service I've stayed at this hotel many times. Love the room, love the location (used to live in Dallas near this location). Don't like some of the staff attitudes. I've asked for a later check out, desk staff acts like its a big deal. Their check out time is 11:00, only asked to stay until 12:30. During my last stay they had a water problem that wasn't mentioned at check in. No water from 10am to 4pm!!!!! No discount on the room. Still got the snobby attitude when I asked to stay until 12:30. Bradford should offer some perks for loyality especially for this so-called boutique hotel.

<Content>Bradford Suites at Lincoln Park is a Great Place to Stay The Bradford Suites at Lincoln Park is located off the Central Expwy at the Northpark Mall. It offers great suites for extended stay guests. The staff is excellent and provides for a very home-like atmosphere. They offer free breakfast daily and a manager's cocktail hour on Wed eves. I stayed here most of the summer in 2004 and loved every minute of it. Another plus is the covered garage for self parking.... You won't beleive how nice this place is for the inexpensive rates.... unbelievable!!

<Content>As good as expected We just stayed one night last weekend, so had none of the problems mentioned with multi-day stays, internet, etc. The staff were perfectly friendly, the space was attractive, neat, and clean, everything worked, and the breakfast buffet, with hot Mexican scrambled egg breakfast tacos, was well above average. Free garage parking was very convenient, as is the location to Central Expressway, NorthPark Mall, etc. It's not The Mansion, but for the price I think it's very fine.

<Content>wouldn't return don't stay here. i ended up here as a result of their downtown dallas location bumping me with a confirmed reservation held with a credit card. upon arrival at lincoln park (6 miles out of my way), the room i was sent to had not been cleaned. the noise from the floor above was unacceptable for a business traveler. the high speed internet connection was slower than most dial-up connections i've had, and housekeeping kept rewashing the same (clean) dishes every day. the staff appeared totally disinterested in guest satisfaction.

<Content>OK experience, decent value This facility is a good choice for business or other travellers who want a large unit with cooking facilities. I have stayed here twice, once in a junior suite (no separate bedroom), and once in a full suite (with a separate bedroom). The units were roomy and clean, had a basic kitchenette, and a large desk area that would be useful for business travellers. They were decorated rather plainly (walls were a very depressing grey beige color), and hence had a somewhat spartan feel. There was a outdoor pool, a business center, and a small 24 hour store where some drinks and foodstuffs could be purchased. There was a decent buffet breakfast in the morning. Hotel services were not extensive, but staff was professional and friendly.

<Content>Thanks for the Interim Home! We sold our old house before our new one was built and the Bradford at Lincoln Park was literally our home for five weeks. It was a wonderful place to stay; the management was very accomodating; the Wednesday Happy hour was a nice amenity as was the laundry facilities and complimentary breakfast. If we needed extra towels, they provided them. The 24-hour little store was nice in case of emergencies; the price was right. I'm glad we're in our new home, now, but the Bradford at Lincoln Park was a great place to be in the interim!! Thanks, Bradford!!!! You provided my wife and I an invaluable service during the interim.

<Content>Don't stay here The Bradford does not treat its guests well and I do NOT recommend staying there. The front desk does not communicate well with housekeeping, so they will throw away your items if they think you have checked out, even if you haven't.
