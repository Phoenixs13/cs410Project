<Content>Plastic Cube as bathroom !! First the good things about the Allegra, the location is superb, just at Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse, but in a silent street with lots of restaurants around. However, the quality of the hotel itself is (friendly speaking) borderline. Instead of a bathroom the rooms are equipped with a plastic cube with a little more than 1squared meter size (including toilet, shower and sink). It means, you basically have the toilet under the shower. This is FAR below German standard I must say. Secondly, the breakfast room is tiny and there are not enough tables to fit all guests. Hence, you will have to squeeze yourself at any table, where there is a vacant seat, having breakfast with strangers at your table. The breakfast itself is excellent, but there the breakfast room does not provide an environment to appreciate this. Finally, schedule enough time to get to your room. A single tiny elevator serves the 80 rooms. All in all, I found this hotel disappointing, but the locationmakes up for some pitfalls.

<Content>perfect location, good functional hotel I spent five nights at Hotel Allegra during business travel early March. The tariff was fair price, so rather expensive but not too expenasive in comparison with other hotels in the city where some colleagues were hosted. Perfect location, close to UBahn und SBahn Friedrichstrasse, where all connections stop and go. Good restaurants, pubs or theatre are at a stone's throw (do not miss the Staendige Vertretung). At Friedrichstrasse station you get everything at any daytime: Berlin daily or 7days card, phone card, lunch or dinner, bread or cakes, a small market. The single room was at the sixth and highest floor, from the window I could have a look at the Reichstag Dome and the silent inner court. Room was large, bathroom small but functional. I used the room only for sleeping and changing clothes. I heard a noise in the night if leaving the window open. If shut, no noise. Breakfast in the -2 level was good and rich (at least for Italian habits), the staff was rather cold and not friendly. I forgot to say that Hotel Allegra is the dependance of Hotel Albrechtshof. Both belong to the Berliner Mission, so you can say a prayer in the small chapel in the main building. All at all I recommend Hotel Allegra. I heard comments from many colleagues complaining of position and services of their accommodation. Berlin is anstrengend, so hotel location is very important.

<Content>in the middle of Mitte ! We stayed here for 3 nights and are very enthusiastic about it. It's right in the middle of Berlin Mitte: 600 metres from the Reichstag and about 10 minutes from Unter den Linden. Bahnhof Friedrichsstrasse is just around the corner! And yet the Albrechsstrasse is very peaceful and calm with cosy little restaurants and caf茅s (Schiffbaudamm is in the neighbourhood, great to have a drink there on a terrace esp. late at night).Our room was big, sober and clean, just as we like it. We were very pleased with it!The breakfast (buffet) was excellent and the staff friendly. A minor detail : the breakfast-room was a bit too small.The ratings are okay. We loved Berlin (and this hotel) so much that we want to go back next year. I hope we will have a room in the Allegra Hotel again.

<Content>Great location, good value I loved staying at the Hotel Allegra! The location was fantastic, right near the Friedrichstrasse station, which is smack in the middle of everything. In walking distance to Unter den Linden and a lot of the historic sites. Very good breakfast, rooms were clean and comfortable though rather small, especially the bathroom, which reminded me of a space capsule. Across the street is its sister hotel, which has a restaurant and is more upscale (and more expensive).
