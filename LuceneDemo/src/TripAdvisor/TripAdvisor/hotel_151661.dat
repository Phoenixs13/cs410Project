<Content>Wheelchaoir users beware Yes, the people who run the hotel are very nice. Yes, the view from the pool is very pretty. But I don't know why anyone would choose to stay at this hotel when there are so many beautiful hotels, for the same price, RIGHT ON THE BEACH. I selected Crow's Nest because I use a wheelchair, and they said they had a wheelchair accessible room. It was NOT accessible. They had to take the bathroom door down so that I could squeeze through (I am not a large woman, my chair is only 24 inches wide). There were no grab bars in the bathroom, and the shower had a large lip. They had put a plastic pool chair into the shower because I had requested a shower chair. I am appalled they call themselves accessible. The Puerto Rican Tourism bureau also has them listed as an accessible hotel, and I will be contacting to let them know this is not accurate.Our room had a run-down kitchen in it, which was nice to boil some eggs, but we had to wash every plate and pot before we used them because they were so dirty. They do give out beach towels, that was nice, but I just read some other reviews saying the hotel had beach chairs - I wish I had know that, but they never told us about them!There are so many other lovely places to stay (I wish we had known ahead of time) - like Blue Horizon, which is wheelchair accessible, or Hector's By the Sea, which has just one step into their rooms, and I will stay in those places next time.

<Content>Won't stay elsewhere on Vieques I have stayed at the Crow's Nest three times, both before and after the opening of Il Jardin (the new Bar/Grill casual restaurant). I'm actually SHOCKED that someone reported poor customer service. Both my family and friends of ours are repeat customers and from my first visit found the owners and staff friendly and accommodating. Regarding the opening of Il Jardin - the owners DID receive complaints regarding noise right after the opening and IMMEDIATELY took action to resolve these complaints. By our visit shortly after opening, they actively stopped serving and tried to have the area quiet by 9pm for the hotel guests. Unlike many Carribean properties, you will find that many Crow's Nest employees have been with the property for years. The gentleman who served our dinner during year one had promoted and planned an AMAZING New Year's menu during year three. Anyway. Yes, the rooms are not new and not what you would find at the resort. Still, they are comfortable and clean, have stove/refrig/microwave/cable/AC. The hotel provides beach chairs, coolers and ice, and a continental breakfast.. Snacks and water are available for purchase in the office. What else do you need on an island where you will spend 90% of your time at the beach?

<Content>Perfect! I was pleasantly surprised by how many amenities our room had - microwave, fridge, sink+cabinets+kitchen utensils, lovely bathroom, breakfast table, and amazing balcony. All the rooms are well ventilated and guests wake up to the sound of roosters - all in all, a very lovely and tranquil spot of paradise. The only thing to complain of is that the restaurant at the guest house is a bit pricey (average price for a dinner for 2 is around $80 including tips), but in general, all meals in Vieques are a bit overpriced for being of average quality. The guest house does offer a complimentary continental breakfast, though, and this was always nicely prepared and guests are treated to fresh juice such as passion fruit. Be aware that if you stay at Crow's Nest, or anywhere in Vieques for that matter, you have to get a car! They go for about $50/day not including insurance ($10-15/day). With a car, virtually anywhere on the island can be reached in less than 20 minutes. Without car, you have to taxi it or get a bike, and both are unreliable - there are very few taxis on Vieques and the weather is a bit unpredictable because it drizzles w/o warning. 1/3 of the roads are dirt, so there may be washouts or other routes unfit for walking or biking. Cars are the way to go, and I recommend reserving it before you even book a room because the vehicles are much harder to come by.

<Content>the worst customer service I鈥檓 from PR and I have to say, the customer service in this 鈥渉otel鈥?was poor, after a day to get there, they cancel my reservation with not reason and the manager after this, treat us like nobody, so I decide to come back to Luquillo and stay in Westin Rio Mar, and I think that was the best decision that I make with my husband, because the place look very simple to make me pay $130.00 per night when I pay $179.00 in Westin Rio Mar.

<Content>It was okay Having stayed at the Crow's Nest previously (several years ago) we pretty much knew what to expect. Nothing has changed much. Some good, some bad. Bad because the rooms have not been touched in terms of painting or refurbishing since our last visit, and good in that the new restaurant served nice meals and the waiters were very good in comparison to the other restaurants on the island. The hotel management really needs to do something to freshen things up around the property (buildings). The buidlings are looking run down and in need of attention - a little bit of effort would certainly enhance the visual appeal of the place. The pool and gardens at the rear are beautiful - nice to see how the grounds matured since our last visit.Pleasantly surprised that the breakfast provided was MUCH better than our first visit. There was lots of selection and it was very good.Here is my real beef about this place - in two visits (of many nights duration both times), the hotel staff were always less than friendly or attentive. It's like they don't even care you are there, or that you chose their hotel for your vacation. I always feel like I am putting them out by asking a simple question or mentioning something that might need to be fixed in the room (which it never was). It was a small thing, but at least an attempt to resolve would have been nice.This is why we won't be returning to the hotel for a stay on future visits and won't be recommending to our friends any longer. This is really a 2 star hotel now when I would have previously given it 3 stars. Don't get me wrong, we had a nice time - but there are just better places to stay for the price. It is too bad because this place is in a good location. But without sprucing up the rooms a little bit and considering the attitude of the management, I don't see any reason to return. There are lots of other places to stay that actually want my business.

<Content>best trip to Vieques After driving around on the main land of Puerto Rico we saw a ad for the Bio Bays and decided we must see them before we head back to California. We decided at 4pm that day to go to Vieques. The wonderful people at the Crow's Nest made all the arrangements for the tour to the bay. We were in such a hurry we ended up having to fly because we couldn't make the ferry on time. The Crow's Nest provided the phone # to the airlines to Vieques. Because we were running late the Bio bay tour people picked us at the aiport. Needless to say the staff at Crow's Nest was wonderful!! Even our transportation the next morning back at 8am was taken care of!!! We had a short but, wonderful trip!!! We would definitely recommend The Crow's Nest to anyone who ask!!! The food was the best and staff go beyond their duties to take care of you!!!

<Content>They met and exceeded our expectations The Crow's Nest was just what we were looking for. A quiet, intimate, relaxing atmosphere. I have not one complaint and can only offer rave reviews. Room was spacious and clean. Our room was on the second floor with a private balcony. A view of a beautiful flamboya tree being host to many hummingbirds. This guest house is set in the midst of a tropical garden very well kept and ablsolutely beautiful. I just don't see how anyone could not feel at peace here. The staff was very friendly and more than willing to answer our numerous questions and provide us with all we needed. The Crow's Nest along with all of Vieques and it's people met and exceeded all of our expectations. I will stay nowhere else when I return and I hope it will be soon.

<Content>Loved the setting The Crow's nest was a lovely small hotel which provided roomy airconditioned rooms with kitchens, porches and a clean lovely small pool to take a dip in before going to bed. The staff was friendly and knows everything about the island. I would definitiely stay there again, and especially so if I went with family including kids or elders. it's a great value for the price, and has a warm Happy hour every Tuesday 5-7:30.

<Content>2 Bedroom Suite was fabulous Crow's Nest is a very nice, well-managed property. The management was very helpful and attentive. We were more than pleasantly surprised when we were shown our huge two bedroom suite, with a bathroom in each bedroom (one was twice the size of my apartment bathroom), living room/fully equipped kitchen, and huge deck overlooking the pool area and looking out over the hills to the Atlantic. All this for under $250 a night. There were 3 of us; I think you could have slept at least 4 and maybe 6 in the suite. The pool is not huge, but is very nice. The restaurant was in a lovely setting, but the food was somewhat disappointing. But there are enough other very good restaurants on Vieques. Although you are not on the Caribbean, it is really very close by car. The outdoor bar was not open while we were there, so I don't know about the noise other reviewers mentioned. Our experience was of peace and quiet. One thing to note in the suite--there's no windows that open in the living room--there are glass doors to the deck--and although there's a ceiling fan, no a/c, so it can get warm unless you keep the doors open or make sure to access cross ventilation from the bedrooms. (I think there were a/cs in the bedroom, but i think we just used ceiling fans).

<Content>friendly guesthouse, good value I just returned from 4 nights at the Crow's Nest. It is a great value for the money. It is not super fancy - but the rooms are clean, the pool area is very pleasant with a great view  pretty landscaping, and the property is well kept up. Some rooms are nicer than others (one night at happy hour we all did a big tour of various rooms). In general the rooms in the newer building are nicer, and the rooms on the second floor are nicer than those on the first floor. There is a simple continental breakfast -- i.e. bagels, coffee, juice, and canned fruit --- but it is nice to have a little something before venturing out. The staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable about Vieques. They are totally willing to help you organize whatever you need. I traveled to Vieques as a single woman and felt very comfortable at the Crow's Nest. I met other travelers and had a great time. The only down sides to the Crow's Nest are that you need some form of transportation to get to the beaches and to either Esperanza or Isabel II (i.e. car, moped, publico, other guest) and that it is not quiet in the mornings - chickens, staff working on the property, etc. I would stay at the Crow's Nest again.

<Content>Loved it Ideally located; close to town, but far enough away to feel you were in the  forest. Property well kept and reasonably priced. Our room had a living  area/kitchenette (micro, stove, fridge, coffee maker, toaster, dishes,  flatware); bath with shower; queen bedroom, all air conditioned. Small patio outside. First rate small restaurant open only Thurs thru Sun. Great steaks with huge  portions. Front desk staff is second to none in courtesy, professionalism,  helpfulness. Lawrence and Maritza were key players in our favorable view of the Crow's  Nest. They can and will arrange everything you need to make your stay  comfortable and memorable.Caution: Vieques has only three gas stations, two of which frequently run out  of gas by the weekend. Fuel resupply is by boat and may not become available  until Tuesday.

<Content>My wife and I loved it First a little bit about Puerto Rico and this beautiful lil island Vieques which was the probably the reason why we went to Puerto Rico in the first placeReading about places to go with a mind always trying to visulaize places we will see and stay, can be overwhelming sometime- but just a brief insight on crows nest made it an easy decision. Crows nest is a real cozy place with a very HOME AWAY FROM HOME feel- It is perfect if you want to take a dip in the pool which could be right down the stairs from your well kept room. it also has a little walkway leading to a tropical garden. The staff at the reception was great- helpful /knowledgible and courteous. Incidentally you also have a view of the ocean from certain parts of the nest-The lamp chops in the restaurant are one of the best we have eaten anywhere.. if you decide to go to the beach- the staff will equip you with a beach umbrella, chairs, towels..you can always count on the housekeeping to keep your room real tidy..overall a very good experience. we recommend it. The place is between the southern town of Isprerenza and northern town of Isabella Segunda.

<Content>Cozy  My boyfriend and I spent a wonderful extended weekend at the Crow's Nest in Vieques in March, 2006. The hotel assisted with a car rental, which was really helpful. The hotel has an honor snack bar and two restaurants. Although both were good, we enjoyed the pool-side restaurant more than the more upscale upstairs restaurant, which we visited on prime rib night.We stayed in a room with a double bed, mini-fridge and microwave. It was clean and comfortable. We often had the entire pool area to ourselves. I highly recommend this hotel as a place to unwind and enjoy island life!A warning to visitors to Vieques: there are no traffic lights, and intersections can be dangerous. Please be careful!!!

<Content>Pretty nice Really cute little place. Landscaping and architecture are unique. Stayed in a room w/o kitchen, minifridge was adequate. Pool is nice to lounge around, didn't go in. Breakfast was so-so. Two on premise restaurants, but both are closed certain days of the week and pretty much all restaurants/kitchens are closed at 9-9:30pm on the island. Fairly clean, very informative binders in every room, staff is nice but distant.

<Content>Way, way overrated and not very Vieques like I was really disappointed with this place. It was just about the only spot on Vieques that reminded me of the all the gross American vacation spot things I go to Vieques for to leave behind. The bar scene was repulsive and loud. The hotel itself was more like a motel. The view was overrated. Most of all, it was noisy, noisy, noisy. Stay somewhere else on this beautiful island.

<Content>No longer Tranquil The Crow's Nest is no longer tranquil. We visited over winter solstice during the grand opening of the new outdoor bar, which was unfortunately situated in the center of the courtyard facing everybody's room and terrace.If you leave you windows open at night, it is quite rowdy and loud. We used to enjoy a quiet evening/dinner on the terrace with the sounds of crickets and frogs. No longer, now we hear the bar. The free continental breakfast has also gone downhill considerably in quality.Otherwise, rooms are clean, service is good, and the restaurant is excellent.Next time, we will probably stay somewhere else on Vieques.

<Content>What a Wonderfully Gorgeous Spot We decided to go to Vieques in September because we knew that it wouldn't be crowded. We picked the Crow's Nest because of the lovely pictures we had seen and the fact that we wanted a small friendly place.It was just what we expected. The gardens are unbelievable with every kind of tropical flower and plant you can imagine. We thought of it as our own secret gardenOur room was spacious, extremely clean and neat and the staff, everyone front the front desk as well as housekeeping was very pleasant.The restaurant the Island Steakhouse was a big surprise. My husband who prefers to eat only red meat considers himself a real beef afficionado. If he had a choice he would eat steak everyday. We both thought the steaks we got were some of the best we have ever had. The restaurant looks like a tree house completely surrounded by trees and vines. We really thought it was romantic. In September it seems that many of the island's restaurants close so we felt really lucky, that what must be one of the island's best restaurants remained open. We ate there several nights during our week stay.We can't say enough good things about the Crow's Nest.

<Content>the perfect getaway As two returned Peace Corps volunteers, we are very felxible in our accomodations and choice of amenities. However, our stay at the Crow's Nest was outstanding and totally devoid of any problems or issues. We had a huge room with large bed, full kitchen, and air conditioning that kept the room comfortable cool. It was also right next to the pool. This is not a five star luxury resort chain with a spa and wait staff. What it does have is a beautiful view of the ocean, a great pool, extremely helpful staff, free continental breakfast, and a feeling of being totally away from it all. There is a helpful car rental agency right next door, and amazing beaches are a very short drive away. If you want to experience the Carribean without Starbucks and McDonalds, book a flight to Vieques now and stay at the Crow's Nest. We will come back.

<Content>Crow's Nest? No, Gross Fest! My new wife and I booked a room at the Crow's Nest for our honeymoon. The rates were reasonable and we liked the pictures on the website. When we arrived, we thought the place looked cute, but a little run-down. We would have been satisfied if not for what happened on our 3rd night there: We were awakened at 3AM by the horrible smell of RAW SEWAGE coming from the bathroom. I should point out that it was just the smell, not actual sewage. I tried to block the bathroom door with towels until the morning, but it was so thick we were gagging and couldn't breathe. There was no one in the office and I called the emergency numbers they gave us to no avail. So we held our breath and packed our things and headed over to the Wyndham Resort, which I knew would be open late. The Crow's Nest management contacted me the next day and apologized profusely and refunded our entire stay. We met another couple who had checked into the CN the next day, and they were pleased with the place, so we know our experience was probably just a fluke. But still, it was disgusting, and inconvenient to have to move in the middle of the night. You might think we were just being dramatic, but we're not wimps. It was unbearable! We still think of that smell with horror...
