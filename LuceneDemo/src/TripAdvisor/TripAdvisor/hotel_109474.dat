<Content>Non Smokers BEWARE The hotel I am told had been renovated and it looked fine to me. The breakfast was also ok. The hot food was hot and the cold food was cold. It was a decent selection for that type of breakfast service and someone was on hand to keep it stocked and tidy. The room was clean and I had no problems with it. The couch in my room which was a suite was a bit outdated but not a problem for me. I did not have a problem with noise either. The MAIN problem was the STALE smell. Obviously there are smokers being allowed to smoke in the nonsmoking rooms and nothing is being done about it. Thist was clear once I stepped off the elevator. This was too bad. Get rid of the smell and people will come. For now, if you are not a smoker and cannot stand the smell....go somewhere else. IT is too strong to ignore.

<Content>Rough Around the Edges For the most part, Holiday Inn Express is a pretty consistent chain, but this one seemed to be in the process of catching up to the rest. The breakfast room was under construction while I was there, but opened on the last day of my stay. The layout of the room was a little strange, the furniture was kind of old fashioned, but the beds were comfortable as always. Parking is also a little odd, everyone has to park behind the hotel since it also shares a lot with two other restaurants. All in all, a decent hotel, but I've had better.

<Content>What a dissapointment. Do yourself a favor and don't stay here. I had the opportunity to stay at this Holiday Inn Express and it was not a great experience overall. I can only say, if you need to stay at a hotel in this area, stay somewhere other than this Holiday Inn Express. I stayed here because it was close to a testing center where I was to take my state nursing boards the following morning. I expected a clean quiet room and a restful night, nope, didn't happen.I reserved a non-smoking suite room online for my wife and I and learned after check in that the room was a bit run down, just seemed old and dirty. Then I looked up at the ceiling and noted it was cracking in places, geeze, no problem, I'll deal with it. The next thing was that the ceiling must have been made of paper because we could hear everything upstairs. And then to top it all off, the outside window to the room was broken, so broken in fact that there was a large opening to the outside between the two sliding window panes. No screen of course and the cold and the sounds outside the hotel came right in. The noise above us got so bad that my wife requested another room. They only had one regular non-smoking room available on the top floor which of course was right next to the smoking section of the floor. So we enjoyed the stale noxious smell of cigarette smoking coming into our room that evening. This room, though quieter still had the same old, dirty, cracked fixtures, etc., of the previous room but at least it was quiet and there wasn't an open window to deal with.I applaud the staff for attempting to fix the situation. But, I was told that the price difference between the rooms would not be credited to me because I had made the reservation online via Holiday Inn's web site. So this of course has caused me to no longer bother staying at another Holiday Inn Express. I filled out an online customer service report after my stay and never heard a word back.If you are in need of a hotel room in this part of Dallas, my advice, look elsewhere.
