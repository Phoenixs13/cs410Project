<Content>Cheap place to stay at the airport Without a doubt, one of the ugliest hotels I鈥檝e ever seen and does not look anything like their web page advertises, however ugly doesn鈥檛 keep you from sleeping at night. This is a good place to go if you want a cheap, mostly clean but dated room to stay in right at the Seattle airport. There was a little mold in the shower stall grout and a few mystery stains throughout the room, but I鈥檓 practically a germophobe and slept comfortably at night. The rooms were quiet but then again I think the hotel was mostly empty. Shuttle service was FAST, and the entire staff was friendly. The restaurant was one of the strangest looking places I鈥檝e ever paid to eat in, but the food was surprisingly good and so was the value (for a hotel restaurant).The in-room heater was a little unusual (Setting 1 is highest heat, 10 is lowest heat, makes sense if set as an air conditioner though). The room didn鈥檛 smell at all and neither did the heater.I would stay here again if I needed a cheap room near the airport. A lot of the other people commented that the hotel needs a major facelift, but they鈥檙e probably not factoring in that would probably increase the room rates too. If you need a pretty place to stay, there is a Hilton right next door for a lot more money. When I booked the Clarion had lots of rooms in the $70-$80 range.

<Content>Run far and fast AWAY from this place The staff was rude to my 72 year old mother when she questioned needing a credit card to check in. Yes, I know this is common and I don't fault the policy...only the way the man at the desk spoke to her. He literally said: No Card, No Room and then he walked away.One of the beds was so broken down we literally crashed into each other all night long. The ceiling of our room had many many water spots and the hallways smelled musty. The bartender and the waitress were friendly and I did appreciate that. We were charged for safe we never used and when I questioned it I was told it was probably Just a tax!! I asked a couple of questions about where a reunion function would be held and was told I dont know, probably the lounge. The hotel does not even remotely ressemble the rooms I saw in the advertisements. Run far and fast from this place...you will thank me.

<Content>Hotel needs major facelift, has indifferent staff It looks tempting, but avoid this hotel.I made the mistake of being enticed by a low rate ($101/night) for a hotel brand that is supposed to be close to the top of the line for Choice Hotels properties. I've stayed in Econolodges, Red Roof Inns, and Motel 6s that were far better than this place.I arrived in Seattle around midnight, so we needed a nearby hotel that would pick us up at the airport. After picking up the luggage, I tried calling several times to arrange for a pickup by the hotel van. No answer and I kept getting routed back to the hotel's main voice mail menu when I made a selection. I finally gave up after trying for about 15 minutes and took a $10 cab ride to the hotel. When I mentioned it to the person at the reception desk, I got a stuff happens response. (This was a few minutes after he decided to end the personal call he was making when we arrived.)The rooms are small and the furnishings are seriously worn. The bed was acceptable. They've tried to put some window dressing on the public areas in a feeble attempt to spruce up this tired hotel, but there's only so much you can do with an amateurish paint job. There's no getting around it -- this is not a pretty place to stay.If you are looking at this hotel on its website, please note that the lobby doesn't look anything like it does in the photos that are posted there.If you're only looking for a place to plop your head for a few hours between flights, it's a slightly alternative to a sleeping bag on the floor of the airport, but not by much. The best part of my stay was greeting the guy from Enterprise Rent-A-Car who picked me up the morning after.

<Content>Pleasant Surprise After reading reviews on this site and elsewhere, I was very apprehensive about staying at the Clarion. My experience was over all a very pleasant one. I was traveling with two girlfriends and needed overnight accomodations. Our room with two queen sized beds was clean,quiet, and recently renovated. Oddly, there were no hangers in the closet, but who needs hangers if you're just there for a night. No big deal! I have to laugh about the comment about cars being parked outside the hotel. Really, now. Where else are guests supposed to park?? The staff was friendly, accomodating and extremely polite. The restaurant provided basic meal service. The pool, hot tub and exercize room were well maintained and clean. For a hotel a stone's throw from the airport, this is not a bad deal at all.

<Content>Clean, Close and Comfortable Stayed one night to catch early flight. Clean room, comfortable bed, and room service. Pool area clean and enjoyed by kids. Great shuttle service to and from airport. Nothing fancy about this hotel.

<Content>Great for the night! Booked this hotel for a short night before an early flight. Paid less than 85.00 for the night including all taxes. Shuttle to and from the airport was very efficient. The room was clean and the bedding looked recently upgraded. Bed was comfortable. Check in was a breeze, and the desk agent was very nice and had a smile for everyone. Check out was the same, and no problem removing the safe fee from the bill. Left too early to have breakfast. The location is good, right across from the airport. Several restaurants were in walking distance. I'd stay again.

<Content>Special Event Spoiled We live 45 min. drive away and chose this hotel for its indoor hotel and family room size. It was a Special Event Birthday Pool Party for my teenage daughter. I specifically requested a ground floor room near/close to pool area. We got a 3rd floor room farthest building from the pool. The pool spa didnt work. The pool rules had 3 different signs on what age for supervision. We had 2 girls at least 14 yrs and all good swimmers. We were told an adult needed to be accompanied at all times.I cannot believe a Clarion Hotel did NOT offer an Express or Continental Breakfast of ANY kind. Not even coffee in the lobby. Even Motel 6's have that for 1/2 the price!. The room service and restaurant prices were extremely high considering if you do not have transportation you have few options since there were no local advertisements in the room to order in.Check out was noon, but the maids were vacuuming at 8:30am. The hotel is in need of some updating. Old musty carpets and hallways have odors and old wallpapers. There wasn't a gift shop or a mini shop for beverages other than coin machines.We were very disappointed and dis satisfied on such a Special Event. We would recommend for any families, or quality length of stay. Short term over night and only if you have transportation.

<Content>OK for short stop-over This hotel room was booked through the website run by an airline travel agency as I needed a place to crash overnight during my 20-hour stopover on the way home from Japan. The cost of the night's stay was about US$85 plus tax. This is a fairly basic hotel so don't expect much. At that price, personally to me it seems a bit overpriced. Pro+ free wireless connection+ free 24-hour airport shuttle+ friendly and helpful staffCon- rooms need better maintenance, both in terms of cleanliness and furnishings- walls are thin (or people are just loud), so bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper- value for the price is a bit lower than expected

<Content>Basic Room Hi I stayed here for two nights as I was in town for an interview. The free shuttle was a plus too and from the airport I give them credit for that. Check in was smooth no issues but the room I had I did. I stayed on the ground floor next to where the maids have their breakroom and boy were they loud all day starting at 6am I speak Spanish and boy did they go on and on about people. Also the place looked pretty run down the carpet was old. My room felt like a coffin as you open the window and all you see is a brick wall if you look straight up then you see the parking lot. Also the A/C heater was high up on the wall. I had to stand on the couch to turn it on and off and that might be an issue for an senior citizen. The bed was ok it had plenty of pillows and the bathroom was clean but the caulking in the tub was moldy. I personally would not stay again there is a Hilton and a Marriot across the street and the neighborhood is pretty scary and run down especially at night I saw what looked like a drug deal going down and if you are a single lady I would be cautious.

<Content>Good Deal, Nice People, Convenient Location This was the second time we've stayed at this facility. Having read the many mixed reviews, we were somewhat apprehensive about staying prior to our first stay but decided to go ahead a book it because of a very good rate (senior 60 and over), the convenience, and because of airlined credits for Southwest Airlines. We did find that the bathroom could have been given more attention on our first stay, but other than that everything was fine. On our most recent stay we found the entire room to be very clean. In both cases, we had booked a queen but were given a king at the same price ($59 + tax). The front desk people were very friendly and helpful. In fact, on our second stay, my wife managed to leave her cosmetics in her hanging bag in the bathroom. Upon our return home, she contacted Karen at the Clarion who arranged to have the bag shipped to our home address. It arrived expeditiously. I did have one problem I addressed with the hotel both times we stayed which was a $1.50 a night charge for the use of the in-room safe which we didn't use. In both cases, the front desk girls almost embarrassingly told me it was an automatic additon to the bill and they were instructed to remove it upon request. Like myself, they did not feel comfortable with the hotel's practice in doing this. Anyway, if you stay here be watching for it. Other than that, I'd recommend this facility to anyone looking for lodging that is quite convenient to Sea-Tac and at a reasonable price.

<Content>adequate for a one nighter Had a flight out of SeaTac and stayed here for one nightWasnt expecting much and surprise surprise.This place is not too bad at all.Although there is a like a stale smell in the room (non-smoking). And when I turned on the heater/AC in the room a funny smell came out of it, but this is an adequate hotel when you are there just to wait for your flight.Very friendly and pleasant staff.It is very close to SeaTAC and the complementary shuttle to the airport was responsive and efficient.I wouldnt recommend for a longer term stay though. But for a short stay while waiting to catch your flight, this place is a good budget option.

<Content>The Clarion is just 'OK' I stayed at the Clarion Seattle for one night on a business trip.Location: The clarion is a stones throw away from the SeaTac airport, almost within walking distance. Appearance: This place is old and it shows. Popcorn style ceilings, red carpet, and the lobby isn't even connected to the room hallways. You have to go outside then back in to get to your room. Check In/Out: Both were fast and the staff there is friendly, no problems here.The Room: Again the room is old. The AC was a window unit and it didn't work well. The water in the shower would go from hot to cold all the time. It was clean and had the normal extras (Iron, blow dryer, coffee maker), just not pleasing to the eye at all.Amenities and Service: I'm not sure if they had a pool and a workout room or not, I didn't see either. There is a place to eat inside the hotel and it was decent. It was like an old coffee shop type place. The service and staff was good all around.Extra Cost: No extra costOverall: I wouldn't stay there again. I saw many other places in the area (Hilton, Marriott, etc) and they looked more updated than the Clarion.

<Content>Not too bad I thought this hotel was better than most of the other reviewers. For a sub $100 room it was not so bad. Don't get me wrong the place is not really nice either. Everything is adequate and considering the price that is not so bad. My room was clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. I only heard a few planes so I would say the room was quiet. The room had a couch, microwave and a refrigerator. The bathroom was clean. The room did smell heavily of room deordorizor. Cable channel selection was good. The room did look like it need to be updated and perhaps painted. You will not mistake this for a new or recently renovated hotel.The free airport shuttle service picking me up and dropping me off was quick and easy. Just call from the airport and they will come get you. The hotel is very close to the airport so you won't have to wait long. The staff was very nice. They are a plus for the hotel. There is an onsite restaurant which is good because other than a Denny's down the block there is not many places in this area to eat. The prices at the hotel restaurant were what you would find at any other restaurant. My breakfast was good and the service was good.Once again this hotel is not so bad for a cheap room. I would only recommend it for a quick stay before you leave for the airport. I missed my connection and had to stay overnight before I left in the morning.

<Content>Wish we'd been booked elsewhere Our stay at the Clarion Hotel at the Seattle airport was not a great experience. We have stayed at well over 100 hotels in the last 14 years since I retired, and this hotel was in the bottom 10 % and we are not spoiled by fancy, luxury hotels. The Clarion hotel had seen better days. The rooms (we had to be moved from one room to another because of a broken door lock) were shabby, a bedside table was sticky, the carpet was soiled and poorly vacuumed, the tables in the corridor were noticeably dusty, the room air conditioner was ancient, but did work adequately; our 2nd room was on a lower level and car tires and bumpers in the parking lot were our immediate view. In the hotel's favor, the staff tried its best and under difficult circumstances were of good cheer.We would not stay there again nor could we recommend it.

<Content>Just awful. This is one of the worst hotels I've ever visited. We called three times from the airport, and spoke to two different people, to get directions to the hotel, and yet we were sent miles away to the wrong exit number. The girl who answered the phone just had no idea how to give directions to the hotel. (I don't get lost easily.) Our room was at the end of several long hallways, which were not air conditioned. There was no one to help with our luggage, coming and going, so we had to roll the luggage cart up and down two long ramps. We called the front desk to get help with our luggage several times and the phone was busy. The room was not clean, and was in very poor shape - I did not even want to shower in the tub, the wallpaper was peeling and the ceiling had water damage. It took forever for the air conditioning to cool down the room. We ate in the restaurant as there was no continental breakfast, but only ordered cereal and bagels, and then the waitress got the order wrong. Service was very, very slow. There must be better deals near the Seattle airport where you can enjoy a good nights sleep and a clean room with decent service.

<Content>Forgettable This hotel is not up to standards of other Clarion Hotels. It wasn't particularly clean and our room was below ground level offering a view of the undercarriage of several cars parked outside our window.I admit it's hard to find a decent, moderately-priced hotel at SeaTac, but this isn't it.

<Content>Flashback to the 70's This hotel has a great location, if you are interested in staying close to the airport. Unfortunately, it appears that it hasn't been updated since the 70's. The carpets in hallways, as well as the rooms were very dirty. The hotel has a terrible smell - maybe smoke mixed with mildew. You can definitely do better for the money, in the same area. I was very disappointed, as I have had good luck with the Clarion chain in the past.

<Content>Don't do it !! We made the mistake of staying in this hotel, thankfully it was only for 6 hours. Knowing what I know now I should have slept in the airport waiting lounge, or on a local park bench! The bed was uncomfortable the noise was unbearable, a mix of the ancient air conditioning units rattling away in a neighbours room and the extractor fans from the restaurant. I sat on the couch and nearly fell through it, it was so worn. The bathroom was disgusting, the grout was filthy and wall around the mixer dial had collapsed into the wall cavity. If you have any other choice of accommodation take it, do not stay here.

<Content>Would not have picked this place! I stayed here overnight when my flight was changed. The ceiling had stains, the carpet had not been cleaned, the only thing that put this above a basic one star hotel was the signature Clarion glasses as opposed to plastic... and decent shampoo...and that was not enough! I was in a room below a hallway ramp so had to carry by heavy bags up and down 4 steps to get into my room. My basement view was of the underside of a car's front bumper. The bottom of the tub must have been mildew stained so badly that a quickly cut piece of contact type paper had been stuck in the bottom of the tub to cover the stains.Sorry, I could not recommend this place!

<Content>Best only to stay pre and post air flights Clarion provides shuttle to and from airport. This hotel is sufficient for one night stays awaiting air flights. Nice dining area for breakfast. Rooms normal hotel size. Did experience the hot/cold shower thing though as did another reviewer. Nothing fancy here, but served our purpose. Budget minded may look into this but wouldnt suggest an extended stay. Not near many other sights, restaurants etc. Quite far from attractions in Seattle area. Just a good airport waiting spot.

<Content>If The Price is Right. If The Price is Right is the title I give my reviews when the hotel has meet the basics of what I need as a business traveler but maybe has missed the mark in other ways. Therefore choose this hotel only if it is less then the competition in the SeaTac area Pros: All the features you expect from a 2 1/2 star hotel plus, free partking, refrigerator a free high speed access. Front desk very friendly and accomadating.Cons: The hotel is showing its age in carpeting and room decor. It might also expain the cycle of burning hot to ice cold water that would come out of the shower. The recycling pump seemed to have a mind of its own and is the number 1 reason I gave this hotel 2 stars. I dont want to experience that again.

<Content>In a word.......FILTHY Stayed in this hotel one night to catch an early flight next morning. Thank goodness it was only one night. If you don't mind REALLY dirty hallways and elevators, rooms that smelled like urine, and a pool closed due to dirty water (with band aids, food and hair caught in the drain), then you won't mind this hotel. If, however, you have any standards whatsoever, you will find this hotel unacceptable. Can't believe they are still in business with the condition it is in.

<Content>very accomodating I booked a room on line for a king bed. When we arrived we were given a room with a full size bed and told our booking had been entered inthe computer wrong. My husband found this exceptable but I did not. I went to the lobby to be relocted into another room. The young woman helping me was very nice but insisted there were no rooms available. There was a young man assisting another couple that took the time to help her with my problem. The made a mutual discision to move us into a suite with a whirlpool tub and a king size bed. I found this to be very accomodating and appriciated the help and team work between the two of the to try and make our stay comfortable. Thank you Janice and Richard Gardner

<Content>Excellent place to stay I Have stayed at this hotel for some time now and I have never experienced any problems what so ever. The Staff is great and the rooms are above average. I have recomended this hotel to several associates and they have had the same great experience.

<Content>Quite awful My bet is that all TripAdvisor reviewers had that one horrid hotel experience that moved them to start submitting reviews, and for me that came courtesy of the Sea-Tac Clarion.Granted, I was in a last-minute hunt for affordable accommodation and the Clarion gave me a very reasonable rate. But I did drive out of my way expecting a decent hotel, and was terribly disappointed. The room was cramped and smelled like an old sock. It felt like a Days Inn or even a Motel 6. How they got the Clarion name is beyond me.I do have to compliment the staff, though. They were amazingly friendly and helpful, even in the middle of the night. Considering that this hotel seems to be heavily used by airlines for their frustrated passengers, that is especially welcome.If you need a place to crash immediately before or after your flight, this hotel might do in a pinch, but I am certain there are better options out there. If you don't need to be near the airport, steer clear of this area altogether.

<Content>OK Place for a family Spent the weekand at the Clarion Hotel Seattle Airport. The staff was very freindly and I enjoyed the facilities. The indoor pool was fun and it was nice to be able to excersise in the room next to the pool so I could watch the kids. Had breakfast in the restaurant and thought it was a good value. We plan to be back in a few months and plan to stay there again.

<Content>Not the best not the worse Don't let the picture on Expedia fool you because this hotel is pretty ugly from the outside. But if you are looking for a semi-comfortable stay at a resoanable price before going back home, this may be for you. In general, the restaurant closed an hour and a half before the actual closing time and the staff was not particularly friendly. The room was clean eventough the water for the morning shower was lukewarm. The air from the vent blew the curtains upwards. My kids did enjoy the indoor pool and the world pool was nice. I would suggest getting a room opposite the airport since there is hardly any noise on that side. The bottom line is if you don't have a lot of money, this is not a bad place

<Content>A great Airport hotel A very nice Airport Hotel. Located across the street from the Airport. Set back about 1/4 block, so there is little or no traffic noise. Also, no noise from the Airport to speak of. The rooms are very clean, the bathrooms the same. The staff friendly. There is a restaurant and bar on site. Free shuttle serivce to and from the airport. For the price, it is great value. I wll be staying here again.

<Content>Great Place to Stay During a recent cancelled flight I had the opportunity to stay at the Clarion. Infact due to the weather the hotel as well as the hotels in the area were packed in. I felt the staff did an extraordinary job at service under the circumstances. The rooms were clean, comfortable and modern. I would recomend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>One of the worst Don't even think about staying here. You might as well sleep on a bench at the airport, it would be less hassle. The rooms are ugly and dirty and the service is horrible. We got to our room and the bathroom lights wouldn't work. After talking to the desk person three times, she finally realized that it really wans't working and that maybe I did understand how to operate the lights. She was going to send up a key for a new room but forgot. I had to remind her. Hotels like this don't stay in business long...thank heavens.

<Content>Find somewhere else Not a 3 star in my opinion. No heat in bathroom, and the tile floor was cold. The heat/ac unit in bedroom blows the curtain up, and we were on the first floor, this allowed anyone walking by to look into our room. The furnishings were shabby. Even though we had a king room for 2 toilitries were left for only one person. There were no luggage carts to move our suitcases to the room. The phone did not initially work. Need i go on? Find somewhere else.
