<Content>Comfortable Hotel but a Bit Far from Town... We found this hotel to be quiet, pleasant, and comfortable, though a little far from the centre of town (complicated by the fact that there was train maintenance). Nice river views from our room. Once we sorted out the bus/tram routes - we were fine but next time we would probably stay closer to town as we like to be able to walk to the sights when we are staying for just a few days. Hotel breakfast was not included and, out of character, we decided to try it one morning. It was quite expensive but had an okay selection of food available in the buffet. I would recommend the hotel, but be warned - it is not in the centre of town and not within walking distance to the sights.

<Content>Great hotel, but feather pillows!!!! We were aprehensive about staying in this hotel as we could not find much about the area of Treptow or this hotel, however our fears were not necessary. This hotel is lovely, definetily deserves its four stars. The room was spacious and clean, having all that was necessary and even some extras for a pleasant stay. However they had feather pillows which were not so good for myself and my friend as we are allergic. On asking for alternative pillows we received two more feather pillows. This was probably due to our lack of German, however this was uncomfortable and annoying.The suburb of Treptow is pleasent, about five minutes walk from the hotel is a shopping mall with many shops and a supermarket (and a MacDonalds). Next to this is the train station, which has frequent trains into the city centre or back to Schoefeld airport.Overall, our stay at NH Treptow was pleasant and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a small, clean and quiet hotel to stay in.
