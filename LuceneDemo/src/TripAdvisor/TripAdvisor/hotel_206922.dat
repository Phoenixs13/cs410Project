<Content>Noisiest hotel ever I travel often to Barcelona and the office booked me this hotel to me close to the meeting room.Arrived at the hotel around 2pm, check out was easy.Got a room on the 3RD floor,Rooms are noisy as they have no double glazing and the hotel is downtown. Then the cleaners are making horrendous noise, i can't even talk by phone.Ask the reception to do something and they say, they can't !!!It's quite expensive and definetely do not recommend this place for persons who want to sleep in the morning or work from their room.Awful noise, awful staff, and not even a nice location.

<Content>Consistently good and satisfactory NH Belagua is a business oriented hotel located 500 m off the Avenida Diagonal and 200 m away - 10 min walk - from the closest subway stop (Fontana).The hotel is in a residential part of the district of Gracia, thus not very central. On the other side, the location is relatively quiet. Rooms are no frills, but perfectly adequate, very clean and comfortable. Staff is corteous and helpful.I have use this hotel a few times and I have always been very satisfied despite being a bit off track from where life is. But as long as you travel for business, I think this is a good choice, also in view of a very good value for money.

<Content>Lovely After one awful night at Hotel Coronado this place was a palace. It is located on the north side of Diagonal on Via August but still very central. We would walk through Gracia every night which comes into its own at night. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the rooms were lovely and clean. Mainly a business hotel but I still loved it. Good value for money
