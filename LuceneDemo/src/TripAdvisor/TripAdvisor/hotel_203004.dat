<Content>Make sure you stay here !! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed Villa Carlotta. The staff were so welcoming and helpful (sold stamps and made sure that mail was posted). Our room was immaculate and furnished with wonderful antiques. There is a nice patio with a fountain for personal picnics; there is a nicely appointed bar area. The staff will help you with access to the internet. Their breakfast is incredible ! Access to the bus is within easy walking distance. If you are interested in more long distance yet achievable walking, you can walk to Piazza Michelangelo as well as downtown Florence. We will be back !

<Content>Would not stay here again On the plus side, the room we were in had a lovely view of the hills southwest of Florence. The distance from the city centre was not too bad, i.e. about a 20-30 minute walk. However, there is very little within the immediate environs of the hotel - you have to walk for at least 10-15 minutes to come across any bars or restaurants. While we found this ok when the weather was good, on one day of our stay there was torrential rain and we (and all the other guests) were basically stuck in the 'hotel' for the evening, which was not pleasant.I say ' hotel' because Villa Carlotta should really be designated a BB - the star rating attached to it is misleading. We stayed here as part of a trip across Italy taking in a 3 star hotel in Venice, a 4 star in Verona, the Carlotta in Florence, and a 5 star in Rome: the Carlotta was by some distance the worst accommodation we stayed in. The picture of the front of the hotel was slightly misleading, as the outside terrace was never in use during our stay, even though it would have been pleasant to sit out.The rooms felt in need of refurbishment - the bathroom was tatty and dusty, and the wardrobe door in the bedroom did not shut - it sat permanently 2 inches ajar. More importantly, the curtains and shutters in the bedroom did not close - we had only a net curtain to keep out the lights from the street outside, so we didn't sleep well.There was no fire exit information in our room, and the internal fire doors in the hotel seemed to be permanently propped open (though to be fair, the 5 star we stayed at in Rome did the same thing).Our room was next to the 'office', i.e. the cupboard where all the cleaning materials were stored, and on more than one occasion we came out of our room and had to step over piles of dirty laundry from other rooms, which had been left all over the floor.The breakfast consisted of the cheapest, nastiest ingredients: cardboard-y croissants and bread, coffee that was undrinkable. Each time we asked for tea 'con latte' (with milk), it was brought without (again, this is fairly common in Italy, but at the other places we stayed, if we specifically requested milk, they did bring it).The TV channels were limited - we were looking forward to watching the Olympics during our travels, and every other hotel had Eurosport in English. The Villa Carlotta only had a German version available.Some of these complaints were really only minor irritations and could have been easily overcome by pleasant, friendly, welcoming staff. Unfortunately all of the staff we came across in our 3-day stay had very little to say to us beyond 'buon giorno' and 'buona sera'. Even when we came in after being caught in the torrential rain - literally soaked to the skin and dripping all over the carpet - the receptionist just smiled and said 'buona sera' and handed us our room key. The hotel didn't do room service but - as we were visibly soaked - I had been hoping they could send some hot tea up to our room. No. We had to get dried off, changed, and come down and get it from the bar.If the Carlotta had been a lot cheaper, it perhaps could have been good value, but for 130 euro a night it was a shameless rip-off. I would never stay here again and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. We couldn't wait to leave.

<Content>Decent B This place is best described as a pleasant run upmarket BB. It seems family run but the owners have a few properties, so it doesn鈥檛 quite have the personal touch. Then again, it is small and convenient, so it has a charm of its own. Breakfast was a bit poor and the wide variety of guests when we were there made it a bit of a United Nations (the French family took all the breakfast stuffs to eat as lunch during the day, showing no consideration for others!). It鈥檚 about 15 minutes walk into the centre down some okay roads (although not very touristy, they are well lit and main thoroughfares), and the parking on site is good. I鈥檇 go again, depending on price and what else was available.

<Content>Comfort by the Romano Gates I reserved a room at the Hotel Villa Carlotta without checking this website first. Once I had seen the various reviews posted, I regretted my reservation. Yet, having prepaid my first night, I really had no good alternative but to check in. I visited the Hotel Villa Carlota during the period between Christmas 2006 and 1 January 2007 with my wife, soon to be 9-year-old daughter, and her little dog. We found it to be the kind of hotel that is most to our liking: not too large, service which is personal and personable but not intrusive, placed in, indeed part of an absolutely charming setting, in situ parking, a reasonably good dining room restaurant with fine Chianti Classico wines, and we were very happy with the arranged price. Our room was a good 20 square meters in size, comfortable, and reasonably furnished. The Breugel and Vincenzo on the wall were of the sort to really trouble Walter Benjamin, but even the David on display in the Piazza della Signora near the Uffizi is a copy. Florence itself is not far from becoming a kind of Disneyland of the Renaissance.The breakfast offered by the Villa Carlotta was quite fine and the breakfast area was pleasant. The famous annex seemed relatively unoccupied during our stay. The Ponte Vecchio is some 20 minutes away by foot, but it can be attained via a very pleasant walk through the Boboli Gardens. The Villa Carlotta is one of those nearly private European hotels where the murmur of various languages mixing over the aroma of good food reminds us of some of the best aspects of the past and encourages us to believe in a promising, prosperous, and peaceful European future. Who could ask for more?

<Content>Excellent Location Villa Carlotta is in a beautiful setting near the Pitti Palace. It is approximately a 20 minute walk to the main sites in Florence center. The walk is very pleasant and through fabulous, non-touristy streets with great shops and restaurants. The hotel itself sits in a neighborhood filled with green trees, lush plants, and gorgous, private palazzos. The hotel's parking is safe and immediately behind the hotel. We stayed 2 nights with our 5 month old daughter. The hotel provided a cot for her to sleep in. Further, they provided us with room service for dinner. The hotel restaurant is INCREDIBLE -- we would highly recommend eating there. There is also an internet access computer in the lobby for guest use as well as a bar which is always staffed for coffee or any other type of beverage. The room was clean with period pieces, although the bathroom was very small. We would highly recommend it for a stay in Florence if you are interested in not being in the very center of the city and enjoy staying a bit outside of it.

<Content>Beautiful Quiet Location - Rooms worn out Beautiful on the outside and the location was wonderful. A walk to most Florence attraction but the hotel is located next to the Boboli Gardens and is a wonderful serene setting. Unfortunately, our room was icky. The carpets were really dirty with visible stains. The bathroom was moldy and tiles were falling out. When we laid down to take a short afternoon nap on the day of arrival, we found holes in our bed sheets. Just icky. It was a very large room. The lobby area of the hotel was nice as well as the outdoor patio. Continental breakfast was good. At the end I still probably would NOT stay here again. I would look for another hotel in the same neighborhood.

<Content>Nice stay, a bit of a walk to where the action is We stayed at the Villa Carlotta on the second leg of our Honeymoon trip. Overall the rooms were very nice and clean, staff was very friendly. The location of the hotel is on a quiet street, about 20 minute walk to the main bridge area of Florence, which is a good or bad thing depending on your point of view. Would easily recommend.

<Content>Lovely This is a lovely hotel! Set in the hills above Florence, this is a great little place especially suited for those with a car, as they have a private parking, those who do not mind taking a taxi every day, or those with good strong legs who love to walk.I stayed in the annex which is behind the main house. The room was large by European standards. There was a small TV which I did not care to watch. The honor bar was well-stocked. It was so quiet! Even though my room faced the parking, I did not hear one thing, until my pleasant wake up call in the morning. Because it was so quiet I fell right back asleep and missed breakfast! The bathroom was well appointed, and the heated towel rack was a nice touch after my long bath in the oversized tub.By the time I woke up, it was after checkout and after breakfast. They did not make an issue of my late checkout and they were nice enough to offer me some coffee and some cookies. They could not offer me breakfast as the kitchen was closed, and they seemed upset that they could not accomdate me for my laziness. What service! I was also permitted to wait in the beautiful lounge for my friend to return. She woke up on time and told me the breakfast was lovely.

<Content>Quiet location / helpful staff My travel agent chose Villa Carlotta Hotel because they have free parking and we had a rental car. It was convenient for that but quite a hike to see most tourist attractions. It is a quiet residential location, removed from the hustle of the city. If you don't mind a 15 to 20 minute walk to the city center, and have a car, it's a good choice. There are buses available from the nearby square. The hotel was very clean and nicely decorated. The rooms are quite large and the staff very nice and helpful. They do offer free internet access in the lobby.

<Content>quiet hotel in Florence We stayed 2 nights here in late September 2003. A good overall experience. Chose it for it's location near the quiet gardens and because of it's free parking because we had a car. The villa is well kept up and lovely. The rooms with perhaps 20 foot ceilings spacious and well kept. Baths nice but not recently renovated. The staff helpful with dinner reservations etc.It is about a 15 minute walk from the Ponte Vecchio so not right in the storico antico but we like to walk and there is a lot of shopping along the way.The bar area is nice, breakfast ample but not extensive. Service in these areas is not their strong point. They have a computer in the bar area free for the use of the guests with high speed access to the internet. They have a restaurant but we didn't try it.

<Content>Florence retreat I stayed at the Villa Carlotta in February and was pleased with my choice. Location is key - south of the Arno near the Boboli Gardens and the Institute of Art, Villa Carlotta is one of a number of lovely villas set amidst trees, gardens, and private drives with wrought iron gates. I like to walk, so I visited the sites on foot. Pitti Palace and Boboli Gardens are very close, next closest is Uffizi, then Duomo - Accademia is a bit of a hike.Another plus was free parking (I rented a car for day trips to Deruta, etc.) - parking can be quite expensive in the center of Florence.The room was fine - comfortable and clean. Staff at the front desk was very helpful - offering driving directions and suggestions for activities during my stay.Only negative was that the bar and dining areas were understaffed - would often wait and wait for someone, then end up having to ask at the front desk to.
