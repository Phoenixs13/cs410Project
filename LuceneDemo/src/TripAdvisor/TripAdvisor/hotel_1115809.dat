<Content>Awful...sleepless nights As the previous reviewer said, it is a brand new hotel and is really clean. However, the noise is just horrible. There are ambulances and sirens going off throughout the night. My partner and i could not get any sleep. This had a very bad effect on our trip. If you could fall asleep next to a maxed-volume boombox in the club , then you can stay here.Also, the double room is very very small. If you are carrying a little extra weight, you wont be able to even sit on the toilet seat. Its that bad in the double room. However, the twin room is gorgeous! Only wished that we could fall asleep.

<Content>Noisy hotel It is a brand new hotel,but the room is too small that you cannot even open your luggage without put it on the bed. The main problem is the noise. If you don't mind ambulance siren at night time, then it may be a good hotel for you.
