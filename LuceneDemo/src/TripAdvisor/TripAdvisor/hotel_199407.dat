<Content>Great location, great food, great hotel The Berlin excelsior is a great hotel. It is very centrally located and easy to get to. We flew into Berlin Scheonfeld airport and got the tube to zoo gardens station which cost euro 2.90 single. From zoo station it is a 5 minute walk if that. Just come out of the station and walk under the bridge, its a straight road you cant miss it. The rooms were very comfortable and warm which is what we wanted in December. Breakfast was excerllent with lots to choose from. Cooked sausage, egg, hash browns, bacon, rolls, jam, cold meats, cereal, yogurt, fresh juice. The hotel is a short walk from both the S and U Bahn. If you walk out of the hotel down the road about 600 yards there is lots of shops and department stores and a christmas market. There is also a big supermarket outside zoo station which is ideal for getting drinks and snacks from. The hotel is ideally located for visiting the Brandenberg gate, Checkpoint Charlie, Reichstag, Berlin wall walk and many of the other attractions. They are all just a short tube ride away. We brought day passes which meant unlimited travel on the trains which cost euro 5.90 a day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Excellent Visited Berlin for the football (England 2 Germany 1, ha ha!) and for a bit of sight seeing. Saw this hotel on the net which was reasonably priced. Having stayed there for 3 nights, I have got say that I was very impressed. Room was spacious and clean. Staff were very attentative, helpful and polite. Breakfast was very good and we had an excellent meal in the in-house restaurant. Location is also very good, 5 minute walk to train / tube and bus station.

<Content>Good Value  Hotel location is a five minute walk along a wide boulevard from the terminus (Zoologischer Garten) of the X9 tegel airport express bus. The U-Bahn  S-Bahn stations and the very popular free newberlin walking tour start meeting point are also there.The room and bath size was adequate. Furnishings were simple, showing some wear, but overall cleanliness was very apparent. There was a flat screen TV with BBC  CNN channels available. Coffee and Tea bags are provided along with a plug-in hot water pot. At the ground floor three elevators are available and the breakfast buffet restaurant was quite busy. The front desk employees are very friendly and I got some very good tourist information from them. A couple of blocks from the hotel is Savignyplatz (a large plaza) where there are a number of international cafes and restaurants with both inside and outside tables.By european standards, this hotel would be a four star. It appears as such on travelocity and other hotel booking websites. On the hotel's own website I was able to book a single room (with double bed) for 47 euros a night.

<Content>Wonderful location We stayed at the Excelsior for seven nights at the beginning of October 2008. We arrived very early but received our room immediately (top floor, facing the back garden, very quiet). The room and bathroom were very compact but reasonably furnished. The cleaning service was fine. The breakfasts are outstanding by any standard and we found the staff to be very helpful with info vis-a-vis getting around the city. The hotel itself is centrally situated in the centre of West Berlin, a few minutes walk from the Zoo Railway Station. I would certainly recommend the hotel though we paid quite a high rate because there was a tremendous demand for hotels rooms during October.

<Content>Tired, very tired. Tired, very tired. This hotel has seen better days and with some effort it could see them again. The location is central and easy to get to. To bad those who own it don't seem to care. And, most annoying - the lack of wifi service, except for a ridiculous fee, is most annoying.

<Content>Would return...good value... spent 5 days at the Hotel Excelsior.....would recommend it ......very good value for what we got c.鈧?6 per room per night including breakfast...booked on-line... would return for the convenience and valuegreat location, walking distance to Zoo station where all transport links are located and tour buses and walks depart.....walking distance to main shopping are around Kudam....we had two sizable single rooms with twin beds and clean spacious bathroom with bath and shower....buffet breakfast was excellent with a wide range of fruit, juices, yoghurt, breads, cold meat , cheeses, cakes tea , coffee etc...eat as much as you like...breakfast time can be very busy especially when tour bus parties are stayingon the down side......hotel looks unattractive on outside鈥ooms could do with updating and corridors are dark and dreary.....some staff were very helpful....most efficient and functional....weather was very warm and air conditioning in my room had limited effect but windows could be opened...鈥?however beds were very clean, comfortable and room fully cleaned every day鈥ettle in room...bar area off foyer is small and dull ...better going out to a neighbouring cafeEating out near the Hotel would recommend Cafe Hardenberg 5 mins walk to the left of the Hotel exit for good tasty cheap food especially large filling salads... area behind hotel around Savingy platz c. 10 mins walk has a good choice of restaurants especially the Greek one;Very good authentic italian off Kudam..... Ristorante Arlecchino on MeinekestrasseeRecommend Insider Tours guided trips, leave from MacDonalds in front of Zoo c. 10 am....best way to see Sacksenhausen and Potsdam in a day is on a guided trip...trips are good valueOverall would return to Hotel Excelsior because of location and the breakfasts...Berlin is a cheaper city than most other western capitals and a great place to visit

<Content>Tired, seen better days I would not recommend this hotel, at any price. It is an old, tired hotel, it thinks and the staff think it's something it isn't. It is in need of a complete refurbishment.I stayed for two nights 19th and 20th May, I would not go back. The staff were unfriendly, un-helpful and pretty arrogant, don't use it, pick another hotel.

<Content>central location Stayed at Excelsior for 3 nights 8-11th April. Good check in and we were allowed to store luggage as room was not ready due to very early flight. Room a little small and rather dated and bathroom also very tiny but both kept very clean. Breakfast as stated by other reviews very good with plenty of choice. Bar prices rather expensive and it is advisable to find other bars close by of which there are many. The Europa Centre 10mins walk away has nice restaurants. The Bavarian and also the Allegro were 2 which we tried and found to be very acceptable.The hotel is very central and a good choice if the Ku'damn is where you wish to shop. The beautiful departmental store is only about 15 mins away and the food dept on 6th floor is a must.Tour bus is a good way to see the sights as you can hop on and off and starting point is close by. The hotel is a good choice if you wish to be central, but not if decor is a priority as the hotel is rather tired looking.

<Content>Great location but bit souless Stayed here for 3 nights in February. Great location , very close to the Zoo station - 35 mins away from Schonenfield airport - and with a bus station two mins away. Double room was clean , with good heating and a window that opened - rare sometimes. Cleaned thoroughly each morning - usually while we were at breakfast - which was very good , masses of choice , although the fry-up could have been hotter. Small bar in the foyer area , pricey and not much atmosphere. Tv in room has 25 channels , but the only English language ones were CNN and BBC World , so not the best. Short walk to the Kudamn , and found some nice resturants ( The Piazza and Patricio's) and bars in the Savagny area just 2 streets from hotel. Take the 100 or 200 bus from across the road to hotel and you'll see all the sights.Although there was a kettle in the room , only 2 tea bags and creamers - but supermarket close to the station helped us out , also sold Bratwurst/Brockwurst for 1euro each. No toileteries in bathroom -so suprmarket came in doubly handy.

<Content>Busy breakfasts! Having read the wide variety of opinions on this hotel, we were not sure what to expect. First of all, the location is excellent, so close to Bahnhof Zoo and all travel connections and a short stroll from really good cafes, restaurants and shops. The hotel was certainly busy, especially when tour groups were in, and the staff were under pressure then, but were normally helpful and friendly. Breakfast, although it ran from 6.30 to 10.30, was very busy indeed between 8 and 9, often involving a wait for a table (though it was a very good breakfast and well worth waitng for). The public areas were perfectly acceptable but very busy at certain times. The universal smoking is more than a bit off-putting, but that is not the hotel's fault. If you can choose your times for checking in and out, for taking breakfast and for requesting information, you should have no problems. The rooms were fine; I can see what some other commentators mean when they say that refurbishment is needed, but they were clean, well serviced and appropriately provided. If you're fussy about decor you might find reason to demur. We were in one of the rooms at the rear of the building, and experienced no noise problems of any kind. I would have no hesitation in staying there again.

<Content>Cannot complain! I picked The Berlin Excelsior as part of an EasyJet deal and was suspiscous as the overall package price was very cheap. There was no need for doubt as the hotel was a pleasant surprise. It is very handy for the Zoo Station, the main shopping street and Tiergarten, the massive park.The hotel room was clean, tidy and warm - very welcome as the temperature was starting to drop when we arrived. The best thing I could say was that it was very quiet, not a peep from the neighbouring room or hallway.Breakfast was impressive, a large buffet with every requirement catered for.The only gripe is the cold nature of the counter staff who, though never rude, did not convey any warmth. That's excusable if you're to believe the stereotypes of Germans but we encountered much more welcoming service in the shops  restaurants in town.

<Content>Not quite a 4star hotel! This is not what I would say was a 4 star hotel, more of a 3 star. The room was okay however dated, the bathroom was clean but had years of dirt ground in and needs updating. The room was okay although the previous guests socks remained which didn't leave much confidence in the cleaning. We had breakfast included with our stay. The food was good however if you arrive at the restauarnt late within the breakfast time you will find it difficult to find a clear table and we had to ask the waitress to clean a table for us, and it wasn't busy when we arrived!The location of the hotel was good just a 5 minute walk to the trains station (near the zoo). And there are a number of restaurants (opposite direction along the road to the zoo) nearby which are very nice.Would I stay hear again....maybe but only as a last option. Don't get me wrong this was not a bad hotel I just feel we expected a lot more for price and a hotel that is rated as being 4 star.

<Content>Excellent location Excelsior is one of the most centrally located hotels in Berlin. It is just 1min walk from the zoo central station and 2min from kuntam. The hotel itshelf its rather plain. The building is old, but in a very good contition, the rooms small but clean and the breakfast one of the best Ive ever tasted. I can say that Excelsior is a typical bussines hotel and condidering its average to low prices its best value for money.

<Content>a bit kitschy  this hotel is in need of re decorating but in fairness due to the convenience of its location and what you get for the price it is good value. the breakfast is extensive and quite good although it can be hard to find a table at the busy periods which is a little annoying. the store house grill food is very good and serves until quite late (handy if you get in late with a hunger). excellent staff in the storehouse grill -very friendly but not OTT. service a little slow but food very good quality. Our room was smoke stained and smelt musty, reception staff could not meet our requests to change to a non smoking room. the hotel is very conveniently located and the staff are friendly and helpful.

<Content>Hotel serves its purpose Went to Berlin through a tour operator which uses the Excelsior. No complaints really - pleasant enough and located near to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church and the Ku'damm, and many restaurants in the vicinity. You can buy tickets for the S bahn and U bahn (just five minutes walk away), from reception and the sightseeing buses stop outside.Room was clean albeit slightly dated, and breakfast was reasonably good. I found the staff to be friendly and attentive. One can easily spend a week in Berlin - so much to see, and I want to go back to visit places I didn't have time for on this occasion. As I have said, the hotel is fine, but it is a typical tourist/business bland affair as you would find in any city, so next time I shall be looking for a hotel with more character, and located further east.

<Content>Disappointed We paid extra to have a superior room, and we were disappointed. The space was about 21 ft by 11 ft with a large comfortable bed, but the only other furniture was a couple of hard armchairs and a low table. The air-conditioning was one of those portable units that you have to put water in; it wasn't working and although we asked for it to be repaired, nothing happened.Decor is drab 1970's mahogany.Breakfast was chaotic -- most days they were overwhelmed with coach parties and you were bounced into an unsuitable small room; you ended up clearing the table yourself. We sat in the bar for ages and the waiter wandered round gossiping with his colleagues, but never came to serve us.Plenty of good eateries around; try the bistro on the corner (turn left out of the front door) or several in Uhland Str 15 mins walk.But the Excelsior was too much money for a basic hotel.

<Content>This hotel is like the Curate's Egg - good in parts. Location: Excellent. Close to train  bus stations, as well as a range of restaurants.Breakfast: Very goodCleanliness: Very cleanDecor: Dated but totally acceptableAir Conditioning: In our room (621) I had to stand on a chair to reach the controls. The system was efficient but too noisy to have on at night - so we were quite uncomfortable.General Comment: It is like city-centre transit hotels throughout Europe, but I would rate it 'Low 3 Star' (not 4 Star) because many 'little things' (e.g. face cloths in bathrooms and tea cups at breakfast) are not provided.ACID TEST: Would we stay in this hotel again? YES, but not in the summer (air con) and only if the price was right (e.g. 2 or 3 Star rates)

<Content>O.K. but was expecting more Overall the hotel was o.k., but my expectations were higher, so I was somewhat disappointed with the experience. The room was comfortable, but small and cramped. Bathroom was starting to show wear and tear. The location was good, but noise on the street side made the room noisy at night. They charge you for parking. The main hotel lounge where you check in was always reaking of smoke wich, coming from Califonia, was not the best welcome. The breakfast food was good, but because the room set- up was very chaotic, confusing, and frustrating. There were a lot of large groups in the hotel, which made the breakfast experience kind of like herding cattle through a maze.

<Content>Excellent Location Hotel about 5 mins walk from Zoo station where you can access the underground, the S bahn, Buses and regional trains. Get a 48 hour or 72 hour ticket which covers all trains and is excellent value for money. Hotel staff very helpful and all spoke english. They recommended 2 excellent restaurants close by Rotosand (Fish) and Maredo (Steaks) both about 15 mins walk from hotel. The hotel rooms are a bit smaller that usual but adequate with excellent storage. Breakfast was a hot and cold buffet with a good selection which included bacon and eggs, fresh fruit, cold meats and cheese etc. I would no hesitation recommending this hotel. 5 mins walk to the Ku Damm which is an excellent shopping street. If you fly into Schoenefeld airport a five minute walk will take you to the regional train which costs 2.10 and takes you to the Zoo station, taxi costs 35 euro

<Content>Great Hotel Very nice hotel and in a good location, about 5 minutes walk to the zoo station. The breakfast was really nice with lots of food to choose from and there were tea and coffee making facilities in the room. The staff and management were always very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again when we next visit Berlin.

<Content>100% HAPPY with this hotel We stayed in this hotel last week for 2 nights and we were all 100% pleased with this hotel. This is the 1st hotel that we can't give any negative comments, everything i.e.location is very central, less than 5 minutes walk from Zoo station, breakfast was absolutely delicious and plenty of choices, one can put on a few pounds after breakfast , staff were friendly, room was clean  quiet and surprise surprise, there was a kettle for making tea/coffe in the room. We absolutely love this hotel and don't understand why some gave negative comments. Our advice to others who plan to stay in Berlin for holiday, Excelsior Hotel is definately the choice. We will definately come back to this hotel in our next trip to Berlin. Welldone Hotel Excelsior!!

<Content>Perfect situation for sightseeing A really enjoiyable stay. The staff were helpful and friendly, the room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was exceptional, self service with plenty of choice. We were close to the rail and underground stations, and across the road from the Zoo (which was the best we had been to!) We ate in the hotel most nights and the food was very good and surprisingly inexpensive. The best thing of all were the tea and coffee facilities in the room - a rare find in a European hotel. Being January we also got a great deal on the price! Would defintely return.

<Content>Friendly and welcoming Very good value for money - the Hotel matched its description. Rooms were very clean and modern. Breakfast offered an array of things to choose from. Lovely friendly atmosphere in the Hotel Bar. Very convenient just get off at the Zoogarden train stop and walk a couple of hundred yards up a wide street. Clear sign at front of Hotel helps visitors find it. Certainly recommended - great value for money. Ardderchog!

<Content>An excellent hotel in every respect Period of stay: December 3rd - 7th, 2006.This was an excellent choice of hotel. It is so near the main Zoo station for most trains and city buses and the main city transport office for tickets and information was most convenient - all literally a few yards down Hardenbergstrasse. We could not fault any aspect of the accommodation - the room was regularly cleaned, the furniture and room / bathroom facilities were in perfect condition and it was such a welcome to find tea/coffee facilities - relatively unusual in many European hotels outside Britain!! The self-service breakfast was of a very high standard with adequate choice of menu and efficiently staffed. There was a quality restaurant for other meals in the hotel at a reasonable price and also a choice of other restaurants nearby and a supermarket for essentials. All reception staff were most helpful and accommodating. This hotel we would use again and strongly recommend for its high standard (at a reasonable price), its efficient staff and its convenient location which contributed to our enjoyable stay in Berlin.

<Content>More like a 3* but very good value Advertised and classed as a 4* hotel, the reality is a little different.Very 70's decor that could do with refurbishing and small rooms with basic amenities.Breakfast is like an assualt course as it is very busy and there are too few tables for the number of guests booked in. I ended up taking breakfast back to the room but some of my friends found it so tiresome that ,despite breakfast being included in our rate, they elected to buy breakfast in a local cafe.

<Content>OK for a short stay Location is good - only a 5 minute walk to the Zoo S and U bahn stations and the starting point for the X9 and 109 buses to Tegel. The trip to Tegel on the X9 bus is about 15 minutes while the 109 takes about 20 minutes. The 100 and 200 buses that run east-west through Berlin start and end here.Rooms facing the back of the hotel are very quiet whereas the ones at the front face a noisy, busy street. We had a problem with the air conditioning in our room and had to keep the small window open. Luckily, our room was in the back, it was September and the weather was cool.The room was well decorated and clean but very small for a four star hotel. The closet was also very small and hard to use. The condition of the hotel was very good.The breakfast buffet was excellent with a good selection of items. Although the Excelsior has a restaurant, we found a number of more interesting ones in the area behind the hotel around Savigny platz. Most residents appeared to be business or independent travelers. Only one small tour group was observed. Staff was very helpful at a very early checkout and brought us juice and coffee from the closed breakfast room. Although we had no serious problems at the hotel, we would choose a different hotel next time. We only stayed at the hotel for 2 days and could live with the small room. A longer stay would be less pleasant and very cramped.

<Content>Good value After reading the reviews was not sure what to expect!This hotel is very good value the rooms are adequate with t.v and air conditioning and mini bar the room sevice is very reasonable priced.The breakfast was a banquet with english cooked or continental or both if you were feeling greedy!!It was buffet style so you could eat as much as you wanted.The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.The hotel itself is very convenientley situated 10mins walk to the zoo station which enables you access to all the major sights.An open topped bus is a good way to see the sights on your 1st day.If you dont want to walk far at night turn left out of hotel and left at next road 5mins there is a lovely restaurant very reasonable and very good food.We really enjoyed trip and will definatley go back to this hotel.

<Content>Not bad at all The Berlin Excelsior Hotel is well located near the Zoo rail  metro station and it is a good home base for touring the city. It is basic, clean and safe. It is your standard big hotel and lacks any charm, but we didn't spend a lot of time here, so it was fine for us. It was a good value at about 100 Euros a night.We stayed during the first weekend of the World Cup and despite it being very busy, the staff was very friendly and helpful. We would stay here again

<Content>Warning! Don't book groups at Berlin Excelsior Hotel! Old, oldfashioned, busy, noisy, unfriendly, grubby, not accommodating and not at all fair! I advise tour operators not to book this hotel, except for easily satisfied groups!

<Content>Great Location I was really concerned about this hotel after reading some of the previous reviews, however my fears were unfounded and we found it an excellent base for touring Berlin. The staff were all incredibly helpful and friendly, check in and check out were a piece of cake, the breakfast was really good. The room was smallish but clean and with air conditioning that worked all night, the beds were comfortable. The bathroom could have done with a refurbishment but was clean and adequate + masses of hot water. I wouldnt class it as a 4* but it was a great base at under 拢50 per room + breakfast for 2.Re the location, dont be put off by the punks/drunks around the railway bridge. I was travelling with my young teen daughter and we found that they just keep themselves to themselves even at 11.30pm. An Added factor to reassure other travellers - just passed the railway bridge there is an American institute that has an armed German police guard on the pavement 24/7.

<Content>Good all-round value Expedia got my group of four a good deal. The hotel is in a very good position. Rooms were good breakfast very good staff very good. There is no downside here. I have read some poor reviews for the Excelsior and in our opinion it doesn`t deserve them..... we have stayed often in Berlin at 3 star places and they have been a long way off the Excelsior .
