<Content>Grusse aus Berlin We enjoyed our stay at the (Flowers) Boarding House Mitte Apartments. The apartments are well-priced and in a very convenient location. With three of us in our party, we had a one room and a two room apartment. Both were spacious and stylishly furnished. We had a great view from the larger apartment of the telecommunications tower and down Alte Schonhauser Strasse. Some of the other reviewers have commented on the breakfast (rolls and coffee from the reception area). We found this a very convenient way to start the day. Both were excellent - no-one does bread as well as the Germans. The hotel information I saw before I booked and the receptionist when we checked in took great care to specify that it was not a full breakfast but sufficient to tide you over until you find a cafe for a fullsize breakfast (if that is your thing - the coffee, croissants and buns were sufficient for us). The apartments are well placed - within an easy walk of a range of quirky and trendy shops and restaurants and also to the Dom and Pergamon and other major sites. The location is also very well serviced by public transport with three different Metro lines within easy walking distance.Overall we had a great stay and we will definitely stay there again if lucky enough to return to Berlin.

<Content>Highly recommended I stayed with friends in a one-BR apartment for five days this summer- I slept on the very comfortable pullout couch in the living room and they had the bedroom. They did the booking, so I did not have any expectations about breakfast - I must say however, that I was disappointed to read the review (after my stay) that complained about breakfast being included - I agree wholeheartedly that rolls and coffee at reception (which doesn't open until 8:30, well past breakfast for many people) does not equal breakfast! Further, there are two entrances to the hotel, and the section that our apartment was in is not connected directly to reception, so we actually had to go down to the street and around the corner to the reception.Aside from the breakfast issue, though, our experience was generally excellent. We had a few minor issues at the beginning of our stay, but the staff was helpful in resolving them. We appreciated an apartment to call home while in Berlin, much more convenient than a hotel room. Everything was very clean, comfortable furniture, a good look and feel to the apartment (modern, not institutional looking), a good set of utensils in the kitchen, huge windows, etc. We had a problem with the wireless internet, not being able to connect for the first 3 days of our stay, but the problem was eventually fixed. This was inconvenient as some of us were trying to do work while we were there.Location - excellent. Within walking distance of a lot of attractions in the central part of city, and close to several metro and bus stops. In one of the funkiest neighbourhoods of Berlin.

<Content>What breakfast? Lovely room, brilliant location but paid a rate to include breakfast. Breakfast was a basket of fresh (very nice) rolls, coffee from a flask, or tea bags and an urn of hot water left on a shelf in the reception hallway. The kitchenette cupboards and fridge in the room were stocked with butter, orange juice, and jams (and lots of other things) all at a (moderately expensive)price listed in the room, and therefore not included. I think there is a huge difference between including breakfast and free bread rolls will be available at the reception every morning. We felt cheated as we had deliberately chosen the place because it included breakfast.Colleen Walker

<Content>Very Happy With Boarding House Berlin Mitte My partner  I rented an apartment at Boarding House Mitte for a 5-day stay in Berlin this past New Year's Eve and were not disappointed. The studio was good sized wih a great view of the famous Berlin TV tower. Our thoughtful hosts surprised us with a complementary bottle of champagne and the neighborhood with its hip, edgy shops and restaurants was just what we were looking for. The only downside of the apartment was the carpet -- it was in terrible condition with several large, off-putting stains -- but otherwise, the apartment was a great launching pad for our Berlin adventure. PS, if you do stay at the Boarding House, have at least one dinner at Monsieur Vuong's around the corner. Unbelievably yummy food.
