<Content>Would definitely stay again for business only. I checked into this hotel and my stay started off as a nightmare but ended well. I wound up staying here about a week. The night deskman was extremely rude and also would not give me a non-smoking room. He claimed there was nothing else available. There were also other guests at the front complaining of their smoking rooms when I checked in, but I thought it couldnt be that bad. When I got to the room, it smelled like the inside of an ashtray, the smoke smell was so strong I went to Walgreens at night after traveling all day just to buy Lysol and a Glade Plug In. After hours of trying to get settled in and sleep, this did not work. I called the front desk and requested another room, they still claimed nothing was available. At 3am my eyes were red and nose runny and throat itchy!!!! I had to call the front desk and threaten that I would have my CC company remove the charges because I literally couldn't breath or sleep and I would have to relocate to another hotel. I have had to stay in other smoking rooms before but this one was EXTREMELY bad. Not even opening the windows helped. I went to the front desk to get the keys for another room (suddenly there was availability), and the night deskman attempted to scold me like a child on how when I make a reservation I need to reserve a non-smoking room in advance. I was in disbelief!!! He was neither apologetic or even decent. He was upset that I had interrupted him at 3AM. I was the one moving my things in the middle of the night to the other side of the hotel with red eyes and a runny nose. This was the worse customer service I have ever received at a hotel in my life, and I'm a frequent business traveler. I would expect more from one of those charge by the hour roach motels. Needless to say, after that night I made it so I never had to go to the desk at night, and the women that were at the desk in the morning were extremely nice and helpful in every way possible. Also, the room that I was moved to was very decent and clean with a separate bedroom/living room. It had one of those motel smells, but this was a million times better than the previous room I had. The pool was small and very nice, especially in comparison to the hotel next door. There was hardly anyone at the pool. Next door there is a Sleep Inn and the pool was always full of families all day and night. There is also a BBQ grill at the pool with tables where you can cook and eat. The workout room was too warm and closet sized with only 2 machines. Luckily, I ran at the park down the street instead. Behind the hotel, about a block away, there is a very nice neighborhood park with lots of runners, golfers, bikers. It's surprising because you can't see any of this from the street, it all seems industrial and a bit ghetto looking from the main road, but if you walk down the street there are nice houses. The breakfast was comical. EVERYTHING was frozen and I would get to breakfast when it was ending everyday and the items were still frozen around 9am. There were frozen pancakes, english muffins, bagles, and bread etc., all hard as a rock. There was a toaster, but you had to microwave the breads before toasting them LOL. They literally had ice frozen on top of them as if they'd been in the freezer for weeks/months. There were 3 choices for cold cereal, and as I recall no fruit because I don't remember ever eating any and that would normally be my breakfast choice. There was orange juice and I believe apple juice also. Also microwave oatmeal. It was laughable, but at least they had something I guess. There were restaurants in the immediate area such as McDonalds, Taco Bell, a dine-in Pizza hut with salad bar(walking distance) and an IHOP (walking distance). I would only recommend this hotel for business travelers or people trying to save money with a family. I got an amazing deal on Priceline for this hotel. I would definitely stay here again but only at a severely discounted rate. Also, again, the desk manager on the night of my check-in, should not be in the hospitatlity business, PERIOD. I felt like I was being punk'd.

<Content>Would have stayed elsewhere I travel quite a bit and stay in similarly priced hotels, however, there was a lot to be desired at this hotel. There were numerous little things that made it seem that the hotel was content operating at the mediocrity. Room smelled, had to ask for shampoo, no cups in room, iron was broken and leaked water all over my clothes, room was never cleaned and the hot water was lukewarm at best. The hotel serves its purpose and if you are struggling to find a place to stay it will do. I will not be back.

<Content>Good one night stay for business, quite happy! I had business at a conference at the Sheraton .2 miles down the road but couldn't get a room there. So, I had to look for alternatives. I was pleased with the close locations. I found security gates, so wondered what that was about. But seeing the room was a pleasant surprise. The room was a non smoking king bed room and still very large with lots of room. A sofa was in front with a sitting area and a nice kitchen area. This included a full size fridge, coffee pot, toaster and more. A nice little kitchen seating area with high stools, great for working. The bath was more than adequate with a long counter. The closet had lots more room than usual, an extra pillow and extra blanket. The room was clean and king bed was comfortable. I think i was most impressed with the open space in the room, spacious. My only disappointment was that they charged my $5 for the internet hook up. We drove the 6 or 7 miles east for dinner on Lincoln Avenue, pleasant evening, easy drive. I was pleased with the room and it's location worked out great for me to have easy access to the Sheraton. The other disappointment, when it came to breakfast, the choices for something close was very poor. Still good place to stay.

<Content>Only if you're desperate! I had originally reserved a room at another hotel (AmeriSuites Miami/Airport West) but that hotel transferred my reservation to this hotel because they were going to be doing some construction. It just so happened that this was the same dates of the big Miami Boat Show Convention and I suspect they wanted to boot me because I was getting a discounted rate. Back to the Homestead. This place is not your average hotel. This hotel is substandard! They did have an airport shuttle but the driver couldn't speak english and I thought the old van they picked me up in wouldn't make it back to the hotel in one piece. The batteries in the tv remote were dead and corroding in the remote. The shelf in the closet was falling out of the wall. The place was noisy with the other residents blasting music in the parking lot from their car stereos. At night, some of the other residents were still blasting latino music from their room after 11pm. I called the front desk to complain and an answering machine answered and advised that the front desk was closed for the night. Apparently it's not manned overnight. It did give me the option of pushing 1 to be transferred to a person. I did so and the person who answered advised that no personnel was on site overnight. She said that if I could tell her which room the music was coming from, she'd call them by telephone and ask them to turn it down. I calmly explained to her that I was in bed for the night, not dressed, and wasn't going to walk the hotel to find out which room it was. Keep in mind this is an open air hotel where your room door opens to the outside parking lot. Not the safest of all the set-ups. Don't let your women stay here alone! This place was liveable but sub-standard for a hotel. Look elsewhere for a hotel unless you have no choice.

<Content>One star Thought I got a good deal on Priceline on a hotel near Miami airport for a 1-night pre-cruise stay.But this hotel is a $30 cab ride from the airport and a $25 cab ride from the seaport.Two stories. No elevators. No porters. So had to carry my three heavy bags up stairs myself.The renovated room looked like it had been renovated with used appliances, cabinets, furniture from the 1980s.The bed was hard. The pillows were flat.The front desk was understaffed. The only person there was on the phone for 20 minutes giving a caller directions...After giving me my key card, he just pointed me toward the door, still on the phone.The only good thing about the room were the linens, which were clean.There was no vending area and no on-site restaurant. A Tony Roma's is a few hundred yards away.Next time, I'll know better.

<Content>Gross First, we were bumped across Miami from one Homestead property to another, which added an hour of driving. Then, after arriving at this place, my fiancee went to the bathroom and almost threw up. The room looked as though it had just been cleaned -- the beds were made, and the bathroom was relatively fresh -- except for the toilet. It seemed as though a staffer had cleaned and then gone to the bathroom -- wrong order!Yes, he or she had flushed after going #2, but fecal matter was stuck to the toilet. There were also many hairs all over the bathroom. This was simply unacceptable. The in-room kitchen was old and unrenovated. If you need to live in a motel, this might be a good deal, but as travelers, we did not enjoy this. Unfortunately, after driving all over Miami, we were too tired to move again. Once we checked the beds and found them clean, we decided to brave it until morning. All told, it was a decent value, but you get what you pay for!

<Content>Excellent Place I got this hotel for a low Priceline bid and I was very happy with it. It appears to be a new place. Not shopworn at all. It's an extended stay hotel so it has a fairly complete kitchen with full sized frig, microwave, etc. It was a little hard to find at night. The main entrance is about half a block off the main road and the entrance at that point as well as the hotel has no signage indicating that it's the Homestead. Wireless Internet is $5 a day and worked well although they block access to MSN Messenger perhaps to block free long distance phone calls over the Internet. This seems to be fairly normal at these hotels. No complaints! I'd be happy to stay there anytime.

<Content>Worst stay ever!!!! Don't stay here Booked this hotel on priceline and called the hotel to make sure that we would be able to accomodate 3 people in our room. The woman at the desk told us that she would note our reservation for a rollaway. We arrived after many airline delays at 1 a.m. and on arrival the man at the desk told us that he didn't have any rollaways and that my 15 year old could sleep on the couch. We get up to the room and there is no couch! So we call the desk and ask once again where our daughter is supposed to sleep. The man states that suddenly he has a rollaway but no mattress for it and he'll call us back. He calls us back and says he has the rollaway and that he would be right over with it. He showed up about 20 minutes later with the rollaway and some sheets. No pillow, no blankets. He went on to tell me that since this was a priceline room that I couldn't expect my daughter to have anywhere to sleep. The next morning my husband spoke with the General Manager who again commented on it being a priceline room and offered a free one night stay coupon. Meanwhile we had a leak on the floor in the kitchen which caused the floor to be wet and slippery and bugs (hundreds of small ants and tiny bugs) on the counters. The chairs, counters and floor were sticky. The final straw came when it was discovered that the towels in the bathroom had been used - full of black hair and stained. We would never even consider staying here again and suggest that you don't either.

<Content>Pleasant Experience My partner and I, after months of planning our first ever vacation, decided to stay to the Miami Airport Homestead Suites. We were greeted pleasantly by the hotel. We spent a total of 2 weeks there and had a blast. We did have 2 negative experiences though. FIRST - The hotel apparently has a policy for extended stays; they give you 1 full clean a week and 1 refresh. After coming to terms with that not so pleasing policy we decided to stay on. To our dismay, our rooms, after a full 8 days, had NOT even received ONE cleaning. After complaining to the front desk with no response, we finally resorted to the Manager and our room was immediately placed in order. SECOND - we had a situation with our credit card - and the hotel's way of dealing with the situation was to lock our room in our absence. Whilst I was shopping, my partner came back to find the key to the room not functioning. They refused to let him into the room to get the cash which we had stored there. They claimed that he was not on the guest list - DUHHH the room WAS booked for 2 and 2 persons showed up at checkin. Be sure to include all roomers on the guest list. After that, we got every request we had (that is after putting the manager in his place). There was ONE really nice lady at the front desk who usually worked the late shift. YOU can stay there! it's pretty close to shopping and the airport but you'll need a rental (depots are close to the hotel too). Great time in Miami.
