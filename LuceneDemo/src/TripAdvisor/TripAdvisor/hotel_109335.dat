<Content>Great Place for a Family Gathering! We stayed at this hotel from the 2nd through 4th of July. We used a one bedroom suite, and 2 two bedroom suites for the 11 of us who were there.This hotel was excellent for our family gathering. The two bedroom suites were wonderful for the families with children. Also, the common area in the two bedroom suite was large enough for the family to gather, work on jigsaw puzzles, and just talk. While the internet went down for the last day of our stay, it was great to have this wireless access in the rooms.The pool area was nice to sit around and relax. It is enclosed within the hotel buiding, so is very private. The pool itself was nice for the kids to play in.The breakfast buffet, which is included in the room rates, was very good. The fruit selection, as well as hot breakfast provided was wonderful. To our surprise, there was also a Happy Hour each afternoon (I believe only from Monday to Thursday) with free beer, wine, soft drinks, and some appetizers.All of the staff was very friendly from the front desk to the happy hour server. The sales manager even stopped by to see that everyone was having a good time during the happy hour.My wife tells me that it is 341 paces from the front lobby door to the entrance to Starbucks. There is also a CVS Pharmacy right next door for any of those small items you may need.All in all, this was a perfect setting for our family to get together for a few days.

<Content>Would definitely recommend! In my opinion, this hotel is an EXCELLENT choice and value!!We spent a week there in a 2 bedroom suite. It was the BEST layout for our needs!! PERFECT!!I was impressed with the phone call to check on us after we arrived in our rooms. As I was with the front desk.For our needs, I don't think it could get any better. We were traveling with our daughter and she had a separate bedroom and bathroom. I liked the full sized refrigerator and coffee pot.Everything was very convenient.The wireless internet was good. They even had a dvd player, although we didn't use it.I definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Weekend Get Away with a Baby! I stayed here for the weekend with my 15 month old daughter. The customer service was amazing. They had a crib in my room just as requested. The room and hotel were both very clean. The breakfast area was nice and relaxing. They had a good variety of food for being free. The pool was a nice size. I was surprised at how good this hotel was for the price. I will stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful family place to stay! With a teenage son and daughter, the Springhill's two bedroom suite is perfect. Each child has their own bed, my husband and I have a bedroom and we have two bathrooms!. The living area allows us to be together without being on top of each other. There is a small kitchen (with a full size coffee pot) which is nice, even if you don't cook. The rooms are clean, and the staff and manager were more than accomodating. When we arrived, our 2 bedroom room wasn't ready because the family in the room opted for late checkout without telling the front desk. The manager was more than accomodating even offering us two rooms instead. We opted to wait, and they happily provided a meeting room for me so that I could participate in an important conference call. Our room was very clean, the beds comfortable, and the carpet and bathrooms were spotless. The breakfast was great and plentiful. Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. This hotel is very close to shopping (Galleria) and to I35 for access to other parts of Dallas. This was our second stay and we think you can't beat the quality, room size and price.

<Content>Staybridge Suite great for families We were thrilled when we arrived! Our son is 21 months old. We loved the spacious suites, the dvd player in the room, the wonderful breatkfast, and free use of the washer and dryer. We only stayed two nights and had to move to the Adam's Mark for my husband's conference. We were disappointed in the Adam's Mark and wanted to move back to the Staybridge Suites. What a lovely treat this hotel was!

<Content>FA-BU--LOUS Stayed at the Stay Bridge for a weekend with the family. Had a 2 bedroom suite which was great. The master room is very spacious and the living room area was large also. Kitchen was clean and well stocked with plates and other kitchen ware.Apart from the little league team running around, it was quiet. The breakfast buffet was good with a good selection. The hotel is extremly clean and the parking area has good lighting. Good thing about this hotel is you can order room service from the Crown Plaza across the parking lot. In all it was a great stay and an excellent hotel. 4 stars!

<Author>TwoQuestions
<Content>Outstanding Service at Staybridge in Dallas My family and I were booked at another hotel and not the Staybridge Suites of Dallas Near the Galleria. After weeks of planning, we decided on our hotel. We made reservations at the other hotel two months in advance for our two-bedroom suite to stay for five days. We drove 10 hours to get there, only to be greeted by the manager and told, there is no room in the inn (hint). I was told that other families had extended their stay beyond 30 days. After the 30th day, they become residents of Texas and cannot be asked to leave.You can imagine how we felt. The manager quickly offered to provide us with a free nights stay at the Staybridge Suite which is located across the highway from them. He assured me that it was comparable to their facility. He made a call to Staybridge Suites while we waited. We had never stayed at a Staybridge. So I was a little skeptical. He told us to stay at Staybridge that night and then come back to their hotel. He then said there would be no gaurantee that his hotel would be able to accommodate us for the remainder of our stay. They might be able to split up my family into 2 one bedroom suites. He gave us the option of his hotel or Staybridge Suites.We loaded up and drove over to Staybridge. I must say, when we drove up and looked at the exterior, we were impressed. Our impressions was further deepened when we walked into the lobby. I gave the desk clerk my last name. When the manager heard it, she immediately came out of her office and greeted us with a smile and firm handshakes. She had spoken with the other hotel and expressed they were glad to have us stay with them. She explained that since we didn't have a standing reservation, they might need to make some adjustments if we decided to stay at their facility (another suite or 2 one bedroom suites). We understood her explanation. The manager took her time to explain their hotel's amenities. She understood that after a 10 hour drive we were tired. She asked us to go ahead and have a good nights sleep and check with them the next morning on the status.We went to our suite. It was magnificent. The rooms were immaculate and very spacious (a king size bed in each bedroom, a sleeper sofa and 3 TV sets - a bonus when you have a teenager and young adult traveling with you). The rooms were quiet. Later that day we received a call from the front desk checking on our comfort. I had told my family to not unpack because we probably would be moving. The next morning I went to the front desk and inquired about our status. I was expecting to be told that we would have to check out of the room and move to other rooms. Instead the clerk asked if we wanted to stay in the same room for the duration of our stay. I said, absolutely! And get this...the rooms were better than the other hotel, and we got them cheaper than where we had reservations.The hot breakfast buffet was very good. The host in the dining area was very friendly. She made us feel very special during our stay. I plan to make a return visit to Dallas in the near future. My destination will be in South Dallas. But I definitely will stay at the Staybridge in North Dallas. To me, the drive is worth the high quality service they provide.

<Content>Top quality and great value for money Excellent 2 bedroom suite at a decent rate of $126 plus tax in October. Rooms were absolutely immaculate and the suites are very spacious. Good location. Easy to get onto the freeways and into downtown Dallas. We didn't suffer from the noise issues from other rooms that some have complained of. It was very quiet even though it was pretty busy. Recommended.

<Content>beware of a thief I recently stayed at this hotel, the staff was nice until I pointed out that someone stole my wallet that had place in a drawer. Then they said they were not responsible. So beware of leaving anything in the room as it might be gone when you return. When I asked for a free night I was again told that they were not responsible.

<Content>very good deal for the price/location i have stayed in this location two times and other than the fact that you can hear what's going on in the next room, it was not too bad. keep in mind that even though business folks stay here - FAMALIES utlize these home-like places for the extra room. hence, the very loud children running, jumping, falling and screaming in the room right above mine-which lasted untl the wee hours of the morning. the breakfast buffet didn't have a large selection- most of the bread products and pastries were old or tasted like they'd been in placed in the fridge uncovered. this property is right next door to a larger Holiday Inn(Crowne, i think) and i probably will stay there next time.

<Content>Not too shabby! Staybridge was nice. My only complaints are that the walls were thin, and the staff seemed to either be too tired to be polite or just darn rude. Everything else about the experience was just great. The room is small but cute and cozy. This is the type of place to stay when your in town for just a short while.
