<Content>Eagle's Value choice While Berlin SXF (Sch枚nefeld) is offering more and more good value connections to interesting places all over Europe, the choice of hotels close to Berlin's 3rd airport (SE of the city) is rather limited. Adlershof hotel (Eagle's Court) recently joined the Accor group and has become a 3-star member of the Dorint Ibis family. This brings to you reliable service, internationality amd fast connection to the airport, a comfort especially for early morning and late evening traffic. You may go there by taxi or subway (Adlershof S-Bahn station) and you will find also frequent downtown trains to central points like Zoo, Friedrichstra脽e or Alexanderplatz. Unfortuately they do not offer a shuttle service to SXF.If you alreadyhave enough of the usual red green deco of Ibis hotels, try this place kept in elegant beige and brown tones with the excellent bathroom quality (black and white marble) of the former Dorint hotel chain, famous for it's wellness ambiente. Since the Dorint staff continues working there, expect outstanding service for a house of this price category.
