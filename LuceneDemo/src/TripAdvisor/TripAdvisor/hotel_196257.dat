<Content>Lies, lies I booked to stay at this hotel from 20-22 of Feb.I had to cancel a couple of days beforehand  was told I would have to pay 80% of the cost if the room remained empty.I rang the hotel on the 21st  asked if a room was available  was told the hotel was full.I was still charged the 80% rate.I feel this practise is very dishonest

<Content>Great !! Excellent small hotel in an excelent location. Booking was simple via email direct to the hotel, got a good rate too. The directions to the hotel were good and we found it no bother from the main Zoo Garten station. The reception staff were friendly and helpful providing maps and directions to the nearest u bahn stations etc. The room was really clean and comfortable, free use of the room safe and great shower. The bed was a bit hard for me and my only dissapointment was the pillows were awful - really small, flat and uncomfy.The hotel is well placed for the KaDeWe dept store, the Ku'Damm and minutes from 2 U bahn stations (Wittenbergplatz and Viktoria Luise Platz). We got a welcome card each in the airport for 16euros each (48 hours) and travelled all over - it was well worth the money.Breakfast was typically continental (No fry up here !!) but the coffee, juice, fruit etc was good - I just can't face ham, cheese and cake for breakfast ?! No tea/coffee tray in room but you could buy them from reception.I'd definitely go here again and recomend to anyone.

<Content>Good Gay-Friendly Hotel Good location near the gay area in Berlin. Easy walking distance to the restaurants, bars and shops in the neighborhood. Very quiet setting overlooking a courtyard. Good, friendly staff and come-and-go as you wish attitude. Okay breakfast, nothing special. All around decent place to stay.

<Content>A Little Worn Around the Edges They say that first impressions count, in which case the worn and dirty polypropylene carpet in the lobby could do well to be replaced. Based on the generally excellent reviews on this web site, we booked our stay directly with the hotel and found their reservations side of things very prompt and efficient. The hotel seems to be part hotel and part permanent accomodation. The lady in the room next to ours had a dog and gave the impression that she was a permanent resident. In any event, the staff were polite and efficient and breakfast excellent. It was good to have muesli on offer with yoghurt and a cooked egg offered as well. Newspapers in English were provided. As other reviewers have pointed out the breakfast room is nicely presented and opens onto a central garden area. The room itself was between two and three star, pretty tired really and the bathroom about 800mm wide, yes, pretty cosy. Our house maid ignored the do not disturb sign every day, which given the night life on offer in Berlin was quite irritating. Also, it would appear that her vacuum cleaner was all noise and no suck, because the carpet in our room appeared not to have been vacuumed for some time, yet the sound of machine could well and truly be heard. The owner of the hotel is a particularly pleasant and polite chap who seemed happy to help on any matter. The last word though must be on price. This is probably good value for money, so taking into account all of my comments above, I wouldn't rule it out on the basis that it offers location and value.

<Content>Doesn't get much better than this.. Stayed at the Arco twice in January 2007, first for New Year and then again mid January (and received a discounted rate). We previously used to stay around the corner at a similar type of hotel; this time that hotel was so overpriced so it was our bonus when we found the Arco. The staff are lovely, friendly and helpful. English speaking staff are a bonus. Both rooms we had were big and spacious. Again, like most European hotels, the bathroom was small and definitely only a one person at a time situtation, but the bathrooms were lovely, brand new with all new modern fittings and gleaming white tiles. The breakfast room was big and spacious and the breakfast spread nice, with high quality breads, meats and cheeses. A huge bonus for us, as we run a business and need constant internet access, was the wi-fi throughout the hotel and the charge was a token 3 euro for the whole length of the stay. Unlike some of the horrific charges for internet (we had just left a London hotel who were charging 15 pound a day). The hotel is ideally situated very close to the K-damm. Its also placed just a few minutes walk from 2 U bahn stations, another bonus as we arrived on Easy Jet at Berlin-Schonefeld airport, so we could take the journey on the U-bahn from the airport to the hotel all for 2.5 euro. On the whole, this will be my hotel of choice in Berlin, without question.

<Content>Nice Hotel in Berlin--Great Value Stayed at the Arco five nights late April 鈥?early May. I agree with all the other reviews. I had a single from for 75 Euros a night. A very good value for Berlin. The hotel is connected to an apartment building which gives it a very residential feel. I had room 403 which was on the top floor and for the most part, very quiet. I didn鈥檛 hear the sound of people taking showers in other rooms which is common in most hotels. There was a dog barking very loudly off and on during the first night (which I also hear all the time back home, so I鈥檓 used to it), but other than that, I was both surprised and pleased that the hotel was so quiet.As typically in many hotels in Europe that have been renovated, the elevator stops half-way between floors, which means you have to drag your bags up half a flight. Then there is an old door that you have to unlock to get access to the hallway. It looked like something out of Cabaret!I wasn鈥檛 crazy about the bathroom, yes it was modern, but it was one of those typically every small European types. You might want to bring your own wash rag as they do not provide them.I also loved the location. It鈥檚 nice to stay in a residential area that with easy access to U-Bahn, KaDeWe and the gay area of Nollendorfplatz. Felt very safe walking alone at night.Front desk staff was friendly, however, they don鈥檛 tend to stay by the desk (they don鈥檛 need to as you are given your own key). One minor complaint: all the guide books I read recommend getting the 鈥淲elcomeCard鈥?which provides 72 free hours on public transportation in Berlin and Brandenburg, as well as reduced or free admission on sightseeing tours, museums and a discount for my favorite, the 鈥淏erlin Walks鈥?tours. When I asked to purchase the Welcome Card at the front desk, they sold me a 鈥淐ity Tour Card鈥?instead. This card offered similar discounts, plus 72 hours of free public transportation in zones A  B, however, the Welcome Card also includes transit in Zone C which covers Potsdam. I didn鈥檛 find the difference between the two cards after I purchased it.Otherwise, I would defiantly stay at the Arco again!

<Content>Great little hotel near the Ku'Damm A great location near the Ku'Damm and KaDeWe dept. store - a short five minute walk. The U-bahn is also a quick five minute walk away. It is located in a quiet residential area and very near some of the more popular gay nightlife spots. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but very clean and quiet. The bathrooms are all modern. Breakfast room offerings are rather simple, but good. The desk staff is very friendly and accommodating for requests. Would stay here again.

<Content>Excellent, comfortable place near Ku'Damm The Arco is located just five minutes from Ku'Damm, in a quiet resedential area. The breakfast room is lovely and well-appointed, the rooms spacious and clean. The front desk is staffed until midnight and offers excellent prices on coffee, tea and alcohol. The location makes you feel more like a resident than a tourist. Be sure to visit the Vietnemese restaraunt one block west (the name escapes me, but it's between an Apotheken and a Kneiper).

<Content>Been several times, great hotel I've stayed a few times at this hotel, and have always been very satisfied. The rooms are spacious, clean, and well-equipped for the price. The hotel is quiet and in an ideal location for nightlife, shopping, transport links etc. The staff are very helpful and cheerful without being intrusive, and the breakfast is substantial and varied. Don't book for Easter, though. That is when I normally stay and I don't want competition for bookings!
