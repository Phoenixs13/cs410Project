<Content>Great stay at ANCO Hotel in Amsterdam Back from Amsterdam and had a great stay at the ANCO. If I go to Amsterdam i try to do a combination of night life and culture. The reasons I stay at the ANCO:1. It is the only GAY MEN Hotel left over in Amsterdam. The rest is gay friendly. For me it is important that I can be myself the way I am without any judgement etc. . If I meet someone I can take him back to the Hotel and there will be no one who asks questions .... 2. Staff is great, after being there several times they became friends ... They are helpfull. Because I am a regular guest they store some stuff for me what saves me a lot of weight while I travel.3. The Hotel is basic, but the price is basic as well for Amsterdam standards. You can make your stay as expensive as you want. They have dormitories, single rooms, double rooms, all shared facilities and a studio with private facilities.4. The breakfast buffet is good. They prepare eggs for you in the morning the way you prefer them. 5. The Hotel is in the middle of the Gay district with all the cruising bars so you only walk a few minutes back to the Hotel after being out.6. It has a lot of regular guests what creates a family type of atmosphere with the same intersts..... If you stay in your room nothing will happen and you won't meet anyone from the Hotel.7. The Hotel can be interesting late at night after being out, you don't know who you will meet. Met some interesting people.8. They have a computer for internet use, free of charge.There is also WIFI available for those who travel with there laptop.9. Hotel is clean and well looked after.Conclusion: ANCO Hotel is for what it is supposed to be (meeting gay men, cruisy, easy going etc.) a GREAT Hotel. It is men only, everyone man is welcome...... and you can be yourself ... ENJOY YOUR TIME IN AMSTERDAM.

<Content>Exceeded expectations I wanted a single room but they were sold out. They offered me 2 nights in a dormitory type room with 4 other beds, in addition to a shared bathroom and shower etc... Although I admit I was a bit nervous about this, I decided it would be an adventure and a welcome break from the usual experience.The hotel is in a perfect location, close to everything. You can crawl from the Warmoes leather bars if needed.It was clean and very friendly. My roommates were very nice. A German, a Scot and a Brit. Although I did not see them much as we were all out on the town most of the time. There was never a wait for the bathrooms or showers and I felt comfortable. I was concerend about being able to clean up before a big night on the town, but there was no need to worry.In the morning, Bill made me a breakfast omlette at the bar. Was very nice and much more than I expected for the price. They also had free wifi and even a computer to use. The only issue I had was getting my luggage up and down the stairs early in the morning when the main corridor (bar) was closed, but I managed without waking up the entire building. But I recommend you plan ahead if you have lots of luggage or checkout at a normal hour when they are open.Bottomline. It is what you make it. If the Warmoes leather bars are your scene, you are friendly, social and you are not a prissy queen. You will find this hotel to be a great bargain and a fun experience.

<Content>Good stay at the Anco Good hotel with reasonable prices... for gay lads, leathermen and skinheads... friendly, comfortable atmosphere. Central location is great if you're heading out for the night to the nearby leather clubs. Shared facilities, plenty hot water and clean, a bit dated but does the job. Didn't try breakfast though it looked fine to start your day.

<Content>Good and bad Hmmm the ANCO, an interesting place here are some good and bad points about it:Goodif you want a short walk from the central train stationif you want a short walk each evening to the leather and cruise barsif you fancy lots of cruising with skin and leather guysif you smokeif you want free wireless internet accessif you like porn films in your roomif you like having your breakfast late (until 11.30am)if you like clean and simple roomsif you don鈥檛 care about room serviceif you like a cheap place in central Amsterdam (was 65 Euros for a single room when I stayed)if you like exclusively gay male hotelsBadif you like friendly staffif you like helpful staffif you like hotel staff to smileif you like hotel staff to make you feel like you're welcomeif you like room service/fresh bedding, towels etc鈥o chance!if you don鈥檛 smoke and dislike smokingif you don't like being cruised and bothered all the timeif you don鈥檛 like a noisy hotel (only seems to be if you are in the front rooms, the back is less noisy but more cruisy through the windows).if you like a nice breakfast (it鈥檚 rubbish, and the unhelpful staff are very unflexible 鈥?1.31am is it no breakfast for you matey!鈥?鈥?somewhat negating one of their best points which is the late accommodating breakfast)Verdict conveniently located, adequate hotel, vile staff!

<Content>Wouldn't return Such a shame that for a centrally placed gay hotel, there is a lack of welcome at the bar/front desk and rooms are poorly furnished, not clean, and smokey. For a few more Euros there a cleaner, friendlier and as central hotels that seem to want your custom.

<Content>You can do better elsewhere I had a local tell me not to stay at The Anco in the days before my stay there, but I proceeded to visit the hotel anyway - and I wished I had listened to the advice I had been given. The Anco is not good, the rooms are basic, and the staff could not have been less helpful or inviting. Would it kill Will on the front desk to smile or be at least a little friendly? There is also no such thing as room service, with the bed left unmade during my entire stay. If you also like guys cruising around the hotel at all hours of the night, looking for an open door and a willing fellow guest, then this place is your idea of fun. It wasn't mine and I would never return here. It is also in the midst of the red light district, which is an awful, noisy area. For this price, you can do much better in Amsterdam. Keep shopping for somewhere better. The Anco is not terrible, but I would not call it good.

<Content>Good basic hotel The Anco was recommended by friends. It is a very basic hotel and clean. There is only one room with private facilities. The staff are friendly. The guests are like anywhere else - it depends on the effort you put in. Mostly leather guys and skinheads go there so if that's what you're in Amsterdam for, great. It's also very close to the leather bars. The only problem we had was with noise. As it is in the red light area, there are prostitutes all around and these attract gangs of noisy young straight guys, some in cars with music pounding. There are also lots of drug dealers. Personally I didn't feel all that safe walking back to the hotel.In the hotel, there's a lot of movement with guys cruising each other - any room with an open door can attract attention and so be prepared for very little sleep.

<Content>Anco is AWESOME Just back from four days at the Anco Hotel. Clean, charming and exceptionally well managed by Kees and Robby. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome and make your visit as much or as little as you want it to be. I can't wait to return. Paul
