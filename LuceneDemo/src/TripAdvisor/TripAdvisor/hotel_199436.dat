<Content>Peaceful location We stayed at his hotel 26,27th April, we found the staff very helpful and attentive. The rooms were large and the bathroom was really nice. We didn't realise that the hotel was a little way out of town, but it was a bonus, sitting outside for breakfast in the sun and watching the comings and goings on the river was very relaxing. Sadly because we spoke no German, we did have a problem getting into townand did get on the wrong train a few times, but their public transport system works like clockwork and the people were so helpful, it just added to the fun. I went with no idea of this city but found it to be clean, welcoming , very green with lots of parks and bridges, and very laid back. If you have thought of going, do so you will be glad you did.

<Content>A good choice for the airport A pleasant stay and good value for money - we got a very good deal by shopping around on the internet. The room wasn't huge but it was comfortable enough,and the manager was extremely pleasant and helpful. When we got there they hadn't received our booking form the internet site we booked through, but he was very relaxed about it and it was all soon sorted out.He also booked us a mini bus taxi to Schoenefeld airport the next morning - for six of us, about 20 euros. Be warned, you will need to get a taxi from Koepenick station to the hotel, but it will only cost a few euros (ie less than 10)Koepenick itself was a pleasant little place to wander round, with several restaurants to choose from if you don't want to eat in the hotel. We did, and the food was delicious. The breakfast buffet was quite adequate - no comparison to the one at the Holiday Inn Schoenefeld, but then on the deal we got here, the Holiday Inn cost quite a bit more ( though their shuttle to the airport or station is free). Then again, there aren't many scenic delights to stroll round at Schoenefeld airport, so it all depends what you are looking for.As for some of the other reviews, I am baffled by people who apear internet savvy but who moan about the location of their accommodation and mark it down accordingly. Surely you would check the location on the internet before you booked it ??? Like most capital cities, Berlin is a big place, and what's handy for the airport is not going to be right next to all the sights. Is it just me ??

<Content>Nice hotel, definately not in the city center Stayed here for 2 nights in April. Room was okay (we have had better ones in a Courtyard). It is spacious, but the furniture does not look that attractive. The hotel is big. There are busses and trams very closeby with which we went to the U- and S-Bahn to get to the city center. That will take you about 30 minutes in total. Like that you can see parts of the city too... Since we stayed 2 more days in Berlin, but in the more centrally located Marriott hotel, we found it not that troublesome to use public transport here. The breakfast was ok. The staff was nice and friendly. Overall a good experience.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed for 4 nights in April and loved this hotel on the River Spree.Staff could not have been more helpful and welcoming. Breakfast aboveaverage. We liked being out of the city centre although we were just getting used to the S-bahn and U-bahn system for this surburban station by the time we were leaving. We are over 60 years of age and so received a discount. We found people in the hotel and generally inBerlin so nice, friendly and helpful although our German language skills are limited. For our last day we wanted to book a package of river cruise, candlelit dinner and concert in the Orangery at the Schloss Charlottenburg and the hotel staff booked this for us. I can't recommend this hotel enough so long as you don't mind being outof the city centre. Travelling to and fro was not long but, because Koepenick is on a branch line, the timetable was slightly difficult to follow. We would definitely go back. Koepenick has nice places to eat in as well as at the hotel.

<Content>Good Hotel, Very Poor Location We stayed at the Courtyard Mariott for 3 night in March. The hotel was great and the service was good, with friendly staff always willing to help.However, the location of the hotel was in the middle of nowhere. The main city centre was about an hour away (sometimes longer depending on the trains) from the hotel. Although there is a train station within 5-7 mins walking distance, the train runs every 20 mins and is always on time. But what we found was that it took forever to get into town and we spend nearly 3 hours a day travelling into town and back. This hotel is more suitable for business people who can afford to pay for cabs! For tourists like us, its not a good location. There are many hotels in the city centre. So do check the tube map before booking.The breakfast was poor for vegetarians. No hot breakfast apart from potatoes,the rest is all for meat eaters. So all we had was just bread and yogurt.Overall not a bad hotel, apart from hotel location and breakfast.

<Content>Super Value, super stay I stayed at this hotel for a family wedding recently in Kopenick and had a great time. The staff were all lovely, the hotel itself was spotless and had great facilities. I hadnt paid much attention to the price when booking so I was very pleasantly surprised to discover how cheap the accomodation turned out to be.I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel :)

<Content>Great Base on a family budget Booked through internet as a base for my return trip to Berlin after approx 30 years but this time with wife and 4 children. We had 2 ajoining rooms with plenty of space, very clean, very modern, needed and recieved more pillows - it was all very efficient. Inclusive breakfast was a joy, so much to choose from and such a treat to eat outside overlooking the river, kids loved it. Hotel staff very curteous, polite, helpful and always wanting to speak English even if we tried to speak a little German! Location might put people off but once we knew the timetable for S-Bahn it was only a few minutes to walk to the station and off to the centre for sightseeing/sports/food etc. Walk across the bridge and lo and behold its like a small village town centre with some shops, trams and restaurants. I loved coming back to Berlin, I loved staying at the Courtyard and would return there as a base. Thank you easyJet and thank you Courtyard.
