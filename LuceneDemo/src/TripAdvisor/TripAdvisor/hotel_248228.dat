<Content>stay away from this hotel please do not book a room at this hotel. it is disgusting. by far the worst hotel that i've ever stayed at. the room smelled so badly. we left the light on because we were too scared to turn it off at night. the bed was not comfortable. the bathroom was disgusting. breakfast was for 1 hour and consisted of stale bread (which could be toasted) and weak coffee. yuck!! not worth the cheap price.

<Content>Airways Inn, a practical choice Yes, this property is run-down and it's not modern. So what? We just needed a bed for the night, a place to park our car for a couple of weeks and a ride to and from the airport. We could have stayed at the Holiday Inn Express right next door and paid a lot more for a place to sleep. That just doesn't make sense! I wouldn't choose this hotel for an extended stay, but for anovernight stay, it is perfect.

<Content>Not the Bellagio, but just perfect for us !!! Ok it's old, ok the bedrooms don't look great, the remote was not working, and the sink was not great. BUT ! For the four of us, 23 to 28 year old, the bedroom was huge with a seperation between the 2 beds, fridge and microwave a nice bonus, parking with camera and someone all night long (much better than a new bedroom for us) the lady at the entrance simply outstanding : knowledeable nice and efficient, the airport shuttle free, and every hour, a bus stop across the street, the swimming pool is definitely nice, located between a M fast food and a sport bar, everybody was happy, and we had the best price of all Miami through Orbits, with no surprise when checkin (no resort fee, or additional person, parking just 2.4$). The hotel is not new, but the housekeepers do a good job (except they woke me up every morning...). After all that we read we were scared but it was so much what we needed that we stayed our 3 last nights. Not a super nice resort to spend your vacation, but perfect to spend a couple of days waiting for your planes.

<Content>not that bad when we first read the rewiew, we thought of going somewhere else. But we have just traveled 4 months in Asia and we don't want to spend too much money.But at the end, the stay was really ok. We stayed one night and the room was really ok, just the smell of the AC was a little bit strong. Yes, they're not really in a hurry to pick you up, yes there's only one shuttle per hour to go back to the airport and the breakfast is really poor and only from 8.30 to 9.30.But it's the cheapest hotel around the airport, and just to sleep it's ok.

<Content>Don't Book this Hotel--YOU WILL REGRET IT Do not book with this hotel. Especially for group bookings. I did a group booking for a pre-cruise one-night stay with this hotel in 10/07 for a reservation in 4/08. Additional reservations couldn't be made because of problems with their website and hotel staff stating their was no reservation to add on to. Their website was non-functional for 2 weeks and for an additional 4 weeks the manager of the hotel was never available to receive phone calls and never returned any calls. Requests for cancellations resulted in being told that a reservation couldn't be cancelled if it doesn't exist. An in-person visit to this run-down hotel didn't resolve the problem (and of course, the manager wasn't there again). 10 days before the cruise, and 10 days before the day that was booked (if we were going to stay there), this hotel without authorization charged my card for the 10 rooms, This is dispite the fact that no credit card authorization form had been signed, a request to cancel the reservation had been stated in 11/07 and 12/07 (well before the 24-hour cancellation period, and that the staff repeatedly stated over a 6 month period that no reservation existed. So, if you want problems that cost you more than one-night than book here but if you do, based on my experience you will regret it. Please note that although my review may state that I stayed there, I actually did not but had to fill in the hotel stay section that couldn't be left blank because it is an area that you are required to fill in to post your reviews.

<Content>smells like urine, looks like hell. This hotel was disgusting. I never took off my flip flops except to go to sleep. The room smelled of urine, and the carpet was very stained. The tile was dirty, sink dripped and was stained, rusted, and peeling chipped paint. The shower curtain was taped to the wall and did not appear clean. The toilet paper holder was a piece of cardboard wedged to hold the TP in place. The pillows were very lumpy and the TV was fuzzy and difficult to watch. It would make a great setting for a horror film.

<Content>AWFUL -- Definition of a SLUM! This place is the definition of AWFUL. We booked it in total desperation and sight unseen due to a missed connecting flight during spring break. I'm embarrassed to say we paid the same rate here as we did at the Four Seasons a few weeks earlier ($385 + tax). No we're not Four Seasons snobs, it was a special occasion for one night in L.A.Rooms at Airway Inn and Suites are truly the most disgusting any of us had ever seen. We're talking gum on the wall, cracked ceilings, and moldy tubs. We laid the airline blankets down on top of the bed (thank God we kept them). Urine smells reek throughout the hallways. Truly a SLUM! When we went down to complain about the room conditions and rates, of course the manager just happened to leave town for the week. Amazing -- he was there when we checked in 10 minutes earlier. Since they don't post their rates anywhere on the web or in writing, we called back to check rates for the following weekend out of curiosity -- same room we paid $385 for was now $87. They totally took advantage of a plane full of us who missed our connections due to airline mistakes. Had we seen the place before booking, I would have paid $87 to rent a car, drive as far away from it as possible, and sleep in a parking lot!The only saving grace is that we got there after midnight and had a 6 am flight. Anything longer would have been too much to handle. SLEEP IN THE AIRPORT OR RENT AN R.V. BEFORE EVEN CONSIDERING AIRWAY INN AND SUITES! Horrible, horrible, horrible!

<Author>Supercilious
<Content>Lower End Hotel I stayed here because I was coming in late in the evening and had to catch an early morning flight. I didn't want to spend $100 plus for a room that I was going to be in for less than 8 hours.This place is right on NW 36th across from the airport. I had a corner room right on the street but with the windows closed, it was not that noisy. The room was pretty nice and very clean. The TV worked and there was a microwave and fridge. The bathroom was OK but there was no place to put your toilet kit. The shower worked well the night I arrived but the next morning, I could not get any hot water and I let the water run the whole time I was shaving.The hotel itself looks like an old dormitory and has an institutuion feel to it. It might be very depressing for many travelers. It seems that this place is frequented by patrons on the lower end of the economic spectrum. Although clean, there were some peanut shells on the floor of my stairway that were never cleaned up during my stay. There is a nice pool just off the loby in a courtyard. This might be nice on a warm afternoon or evening.I booked the hotel online for $59 for a single. With taxes and a mandatory safe fee of $1.75 and a parking fee of $2, the room came to $70 for the night. The restaurant at the hotel is closed but there is a McDonalds next door.One word of caution not releated to the hotel. I found it very difficult to find the car rental returns off of Le Jeune Road due to a lot of construction going on near the airport. I recommend calling your rental agency and getting detailed directions to their location from the hotel if you stay here.

<Content>Not bad, but it's just a simple place to sleep. I found myself in Miami at 9:00 pm. looking for a place to sleep, close to the airport. After visiting and calling several hotels that were sold out, I found this place, with available rooms.The hotel is very modest, but clean and comfortable, nothing fancy. But it's a nice place to spend one night or if you're on a budget.Hotel has secure parking, and a swimming pool. It's just 5 min. drive to the airport.The surrounding area is dark and desolated, be careful.

But the shuttle bus never come to the airport.2:00 AM, I went to this hotel by taxi....And there is a shuttle bus in front of the hotel.....without driver...I saw a creepy guy in the front desk....

<Content>had a nice stay I don't understand all those that had a bad visit. I stayed for 10 days and I found the staff very helpfu and friendly. My room was clean and the cleaning staff check on me every day to see if I needed anything during my stay. This is the second time I have stayed here and I will be in the future again. Everyone I talked to was friendly to me maybe it is the attitude of some of these customers that need to be checked and not the staff. You should also check out Tom's Sports Bar they have great food and are very friendly also.

<Content>lolololol! The first reviewer does not tell the truth. Must be a motel employee. Note he/she is from Miami Springs, and can only go there to cool out??!! Puleeze!! Everything else appears true.It looks ok on the board at the airport, but take everyone's advice and avoid this place. Only consider it if you have a pair of slippers to shower in, and something to lie on, and you are quite desperate, so desperate, very desperate, extemely desperate, you know, cant do ANY better type of desperate. Did I say only if you are desperate? Yes, very much so, desperately desperate. Get my Point? Hope so.

<Content>Crappy Motel This hotel is not updated as they've noted. The carpet in the hotel rooms are very dirty  we were even scared to sleep on the beds. The customer service was horrible  the shuttle service attendant made no effort to help with the luggage. Upon arriving at the port he was demanding a tip even though we had put the tip already in his cup that was located in the front by the wheel. Next time I will pay for a more expensive hotel rather than this nasty motel.

<Content>Terrible This was the worse experience. You litteraly get what you pay for. Do not get the cheapest room, it is not comfortable at all. They do have a person who is supposed to help you with your luggage, but he does averything but that. You ask for help, and they are not cortiuous at all, they can get very impatient. There's no customer service what so ever. I don't recommend this hotel, not even as a last resort.

<Content>Only if your desperate! We had to stay in Miami due to a missed flight. Money was tight and this was the cheapest place we could find. If its just a bed and no more you want then it will do the job. Bathroom was tiny, but wasn't adventerous enough to attempt a shower. Complimentary shuttle to airport. Place smelt very very musty and steps up to the first floor felt like they would collapse. We passed the opn door to the kitchen of the bar attached to the hotel and after that no way were we going to eat or drink in there. Staff were friendly enough and little shop in hotel that sold essential stuck in Miami with no bag and have no choice but to pay these prices items.

<Content>better than nothing Well, the price was right for the day and season. Had to wait an hour to be picked up at airport. Room was something out of the fifties, not updated much at all. the bed did sleep well. room was mostly clean. hall ways are differant levels, so my bags kept falling off the carts at every bump. Pool area was the best part. Had free ride to port but employees say they will take u at 9:30, 10:30, 0r 11:30Am, but actually ONLY at 11:30Am. Some times the driver will help u with bags sometimes not. The driver did help from the airport, but I had to load them into the van to go the Port. I wouldn't use this hotel again, unless u do need to save the $. It will do if nothing else available, also a McDonalds right next door. I did notice that some airline people used this hotel, maybe they had better rooms for them.

<Content>A most unpleasant place The place was nasty. Dirty rooms and everything old. On top of that they charge you to park in their lot. They also charge extra for a safe we did not want. When we made the reservation we asked for a quiet non-smoking room. They gave us one of only a few rooms they had that faced on the very busy 36 st. and reaked of smoke. We changed rooms and while the second one was bad at least it was quiet. But when we checked out the next morning they tried to charge us more for the room we got because they said it was a better room. We refused to pay the extra and they eventually changed the bill. Never again.

<Content>Do not stay here Just stayed at the Airways Hotel last night (4/10/04). It reminded me of one of those dirty motels that are always on COPS. The place smelled like urine, the rooms were dirty, and it was all-around crappy. The people were rude at the desk, and could hardly speak english. At the end of a long, smelly hallway was our equally smelly and dirty room. The bed sheets were itchy and dirty-looking, and there were only 2 towels for a suite. There was a divider in between the beds, and there was only one TV for both sides. The wires on it were exposed, with no wall plate covering it (not to code). Late at night, someone was jiggling our door handle, so we placed our baggage in front ouf the door. We had to wake up early for a flight(5 AM), and the free shuttle to the airport was a joke. When the van showed up, the driver was drunk. He stumbled from the van, opened the back door, and went into the hotel lobby bathroom. We had to load our own bags, and it took him at least ten minutes to return. We arrived, luckily, on time, and unloaded our own bags on the airport curb. Although the brand name hotels charge more, stay at them. Pay for the safe shuttle and a good night's rest. THE AIRWAYS IS GARBAGE. DO NOT BOOK THERE!

<Content>Very bad experience! I stayed one night on Saturday, March 13, 2004. Couldn't believe how filthy and rundown this place was. I booked the room directly through their web site for about $60. (I called via phone, but they quoted an even higher price) When I got there, I found out that room prices were $30-$40. If it wasn't because my husband and I were dead tired from a long trip and it was Calle Ocho weekend so there was not a room available anywhere, I would have never stayed here. But, we had no choice - it was either sleep in the room or the car. To begin, hallways were filthy dirty, hotel looked very old and rundown. Very bad odor. Our room was worst. We were afraid to touch anything! The sheets were never changed and had a bad smell, so we slept with our clothes on (not even pjamas) and no did not use the sheets to cover us. The TV base was laying on the floor broken when we walked in. Since we were near the airport, there was a lot of noice from planes and the cars. When we paid via credit card for the room at the front office, the clerk wanted me to sign a blank receipt with no quantity on it - leaving us with an impression that these people were not too honest. We had to pay $2 for parking - it should have been free! We complained about the condition of our room and were only given a $10 discount. If you're looking for a half decent clean room, do not come here!!! In a nutshell, this was a rat hole.

<Content>I Felt Like I was at Home A friend of mine came to town and I decided to keep her company. Let me just tell you that I really enjoyed the room we had. It was great. It was the normal, no suite. Yet I felt extremely comfortable. Whenever I just want to get away I go to this hotel to relax. The people at Front Desk are really friendly and Housekeeping respected the little sign on the door. I just want to tell you, keep up the good work because I'll be visiting more often. Also, the fact that you have Tom's Grill right there is great. :)
