<Content>Good Budget Hotel Good if all you want is a room to sleep in. Clean. Maids very helpful and courteous. Front desk people very friendly and helpful, but you may have to wait a while to speak with them. Hotel is (still) under construction. There is no parking lot. I parked my rental car (a Hyundai Brio) on a street around the corner for a week and had no problems. Bus stop near hotel goes straight to Old San Juan. Not many places to eat early or late in the day - only one 24 hour bar several blocks away. Is near some daytime eateries - Subway, Chinese, Pizza.

<Content>nice place to stay at outskirt of town after reading all the negative reviews, I was afraid it's gonna be a real dump. However, given most of our time will be spent driving out of san juan, the location of this hotel seems to make sense compared to something in OSJ or condado and the price seems much lower to comparable places. We took a risk and we found the place sufficient for our need. rooms are clean, lobby is barren but the clean, white fluorescent lighting seems refreshing compared to other yellowish moody woody lobbies. A/C is quiet and cold. The hotel is surely nothing fancy but we don't care for that. the construction thing going on next door is not an issue at all. best thing of all is its proximity to highways going out to other parts of PR and you don't have to fight the traffic thru OSJ or condado every day and night. If I go back to SJ, I will not hesitate to stay there again. I would have give it a 3-star but given the many bad reviews here which I don't think really reflect the state the hotel is in, I am giving a 4 to counterbalance a little bit.

<Content>Great Compassionate People My husband and I had to make an emergency trip to the island to attend a death in the family. We stayed at the Excelsior from June 2 until today, June 6. My husband recently had eye surgery and needed medication that the local Walgreens did not have. The only place where my husband felt he could get help was at the Veterans Hospital, since he has a service connected problem. We did not know how to get there, and one night one of the valets escorted us to the hospital front door. We will be forever grateful to these people for being compassionate enough to assist us in our time of need. As for the awful reviews some people gave, I would suggest that anyone who wants the services of a resort, should go to one and play the casinos, gorge on food and drink, be pampered, and pay the outrageous prices these fancy 5 star hotels charge. Our room was clean, the staff was friendly and the location is excellent with easy access to the major roads. The construction taking place is for a multistory apartment complex, and that takes a little time. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that does not mind a place that's not a luxury hotel. BTW, The food at the restaurant is very good, although a little pricey. The place was packed the night we went there. It looked like a place that some of the local people who have cash to spend hang out.

<Content>Over 25 years My family and I stay at this hotel each time we visit PR for one or two nights before heading into the island. We have been staying there for over twenty five years. We have stayed at several other hotels in San Juan - El Convento, Hilton and etc. but always go back to Excelsior. The accomodations have changed with time ( the kitchenette suites are smaller and you can't cook in the room anymore), but the main features have stayed the same. The rooms are large, comfortable and clean. The staff is unobtrusive, but helpful when needed. The restaurants are ok if you don't want to leave the premises, but we prefer to find restaurants with local flavor. The hotel is located in a mixed business and residential area. They have on site parking and nearby bus service. The view of the laguna from the higher floors is stunning. We highly recommend the Excelsior to anyone who doesn't want to stay at a touristy type place and desires convenience, peace and quiet.

<Content>Not so bad at all! My boyfriend and I were afraid to go there after we read the reviews. To our surpise it wasn't so bad at all. The area is not bad, the hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly.

<Content>Great location, good $, clean, friendly staff I was afraid to go there after I read all the bad comments here, but happily I found the opposite. It was easy to find and is located in one of the main avenues of San Juan. It was clean and it had helpful friendly staff. The pool was very clean and a little small, but who goes to the caribbean to swim in a pool?? They have nicer hotels in the area like the Hilton and Windham, but you'll have to pay at least 3 times more than at the Excelsior. There are no ghettoes around like some said and it's a safe area. Now one thing, I criticize heavily those tourist who go to a place and don't get out of the hotel out of fear of someting bad happening. This hotel offers a great place to stay in a great island...go out and explore...go to the beach, el yunque, take a day and drive around the island, go eat to a local place, try to go to a local club of bar, go scuba diving. etc ect. Have fun!!

<Content>Absolutely NOTHING wrong with this hotel At the time we stayed there, the hotel was undergoing renovations; however we found the lobby decor (the remodeled part) quite pleasing, had very good service from the desk staff at check-in and they also helped us find our way around a little bit. Two restaurants on site, both quite good. The room was comfortable - neither dirty nor immaculate. The neighborhood is fair, but you'll certainly find other hotels in more touristy areas. The bus to Old San Juan runs right in front of the hotel, it's only a few quarters and a few minutes away to OSJ.Met many people on our cruise who stayed in San Juan prior to our embarkation, and NOBODY had a better experience than we had, even for MUCH MUCH more money. I heard complaints on everything ranging from noise to comfort to towel size to price. But I can honestly say that the only disappointment that I had at the Hotel Excelsior was the fact that the renovation closed the main elevator, and the only ride up and down was a rickety service elevator. But other than that inconvenience, I would have no problem staying there again. It's not the Ritz, but it's not the pits. :)

<Content>Horrible After reading some of the reviews about Hotel Excelsior, I began to worry. I got this hotel through Priceline, at $110.00 per night. Believe you me it's not worth $50.00 a night. Thankfully it was a pre-cruise (one night) hotel, March 19, 2005, unitl we sailed away into the sunset the next day. When we arrived at the hotel, I knew immediately that we were not in a good neighborhood. The hotel is a total mess with construction going on inside and outside. We waited about 20 minutes to check-in. The time was 2:40 P.M. Check-in time was 3:00 P.M. They would not allow us to check-in 20 minutes before the 3:00 P.M. check-in time. We wanted to have lunch, so we asked if they could hold our luggage until we came back from lunch, no problem there. Went to lunch, about a block away from the hotel, sleezy neighborhood. After lunch, we decided to go into a souveneir store that was about 2 doors away from Subway, we had to be buzzed into the store, after being checked out by the lady behind the counter, now doesn't that tell you something? Went back to the hotel, now it's after 3:00 P.M. After waiting another 20 minutes to retrieve our luggage from the basement, we finally settled into the room. The room was clean. Check-out the next day was another disaster. After 3 phone calls to the front desk, it took one hour and five minutes for the bell guy to come and get our luggage. Don't waste your money on this place, stay at any other hotel. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Never again. The only thing good about this hotel was the French Bistro restaurant, excellent food. Ate there because we didn't want to venture out at night in this neighborhood.

<Content>It was good for the days that we stayed! A couple of my friends and myself with my kids stayed at that Hotel on the 1st week of July of 2004. When we got there I was only thinking of the reviews and people concerns about this Hotel. Our first concern was where we're going to find a parking, cause there's no place for you to park the car! And we ask one of the guys that worked there and we told us that he will park the car for us, until we booked our room. When we got in the ladies in the front desk who took care of us were very friendly and helpful!!! I asked them to gives us a room away from the elevators, cause I read in a couple of reviews that they were complaining that the elevators makes too much noise....But of course I didn't mention that to them! So then, we were on our way to see the rooms. The rooms that we had one of them had a rug which it was a plus for me, the other one had tiles and a small kitchen which I didn't had but didn't care cause I wasn't planning to cook in there, both of them had a two Queen Beds, the room had already the air condition on so it was nice and cool, the bathroom were clean and so was the entire room! So we were all thinking Is not that bad so far...Then we asked for extra towels and blankets and they provided that to us in a timely matter. The night came and there weren't people making noises. In the next morning I noticed that they were constructing a building or a parking lot next to the Hotel, but again I didn't here any loud noise or had any inconvenience...It was very good and the price was not that bad at all! To get the best price for that place go to hotels, that's where we found this place and very cheap!!! The beach is just a few miles away, restaurant are close, parks, gas station and a mini markets for your needs is around the corner from there! If you are looking for something Fancy or Modern Rooms then get something else, this place wouldn't be for you! But if you are just looking for a place to sleep, not to hang in there and really enjoy the beauty and adventures of Puerto Rico, then stay in there and you would feel comfortable!We all had a great experience and time on our stay at the Hotel Excelsior!

<Content>Excelsior Ok Stayed a week with wife and 2 kids (6 and 11 mo.). Nice room in the back with small kitchenette. As noted alot of construction going on. If they do the interior also hotel will get more stars.Pool is Ok in a pinch. It gets all shade until late afternoon. Connected to Paris Bistro Cafe which serves breakfast on the pool patio. Great for kids.The hotel, on Ponce De leon Ave. is not within walking disstance of the main strip of the Condado but is only a 10 minute walk to The Caribe Hilton (over an entrance to main Hwy and past construction next to Lagoon). We used the Caribe's facilties evry day and no one hassled us.In conclusion, if you want to be a little off the beaten path but save money at a friendly hotel..Excelsior Ok

<Content>It's not bad at all... The Hotel was recently purchased and with new owners you could already see the changes being made. The end result is very promising so I encourage anyone who is looking for an economical hotel rate to check-in the Excelsior.

<Content>Better than expected Given the reviews here and elsewhere, I was expecting the worst; booked it for the night before a cruise. It's true, there was construction all around, including the lobby, but the desk clerk and the bell person were very helpful and kind, which makes quite a difference. Also, the room was quite clean, complete with stove and refrigerator, which the bell person proudly displayed to us. I have stayed at 4 and 5 * hotels and know the difference, but I was quite pleased with this hotel, mostly due to the staff and the fact that the rooms were clean, unlike I had read on other reviews.

<Content>You get what you pay for... Stayed here prior to leaving on a cruise. The hotel is under construction, and there is a lot of debris around. There were always cabs available. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful with giving local information. The area around the hotel is somewhat rundown. Would not recommend walking at night in the area. Also would not recommend traveling to PR on a holiday. The whole place shuts down about 6pm and finding food near the hotel is next to impossible. We walked approx 4 blocks to get to a store to buy snacks. The odor in the smoking room was that of a wet dog that had been smoking, but what do you expect for a smoking room. The non-smoking room was smaller but was nice enough. I think in a pinch I would stay here again. Got a good deal on the price online. I think it will be better when they are finally done with the construction. Hope this helps.

<Content>Totally unlike the bad reviews I read the reviews but made my decision when i called directly. I took a risk although some reviews sounded like a house of horror. The hotel is still under construction which I was displeased. But i stayed for 4 days and loved it. The furniture is out dated but clean. I guess thats why their rates were so economical. But the money i saved was well spent on tours and pina coladas in Old San Juan. Which by the way for 50 cents a bus takes you straight to Old San Juan. Listen if you want a small cozy hotel this is where you want to be. The staff was wonderfull with my many requests  questions. My maid was unique she did not know english but we understood each other. Why have all these people had such horrid experiences? Thank god I decided to go anyway. I will be going back as soon as i recover $$$$$$.

<Content>Not bad at all Seems like most of the horror ravers are anonymous for some weird reason. I read the reviews before I went to Puerto Rico (1/14/05 to 1/17/05) and they filled me with dread and fear. Turned out that Excelsior was not NEARLY as bad as I expected. Yes there were construction going on and only one person working the front desk, so sometimes you have to wait a little while, but for the most part, the service was very good. The front desk women were friendly, courteous, gave me helpful information about the area, how to get around, even where to eat and club in old san juan. When I didn't have change, one worker even made change for me from her own purse. My room had a king size bed, cable TV, and was very clean. The carpet was not new but it was not dirty either. I was able to walk around barefoot the whole time without feeling grimey (and trust me I'm anal when it comes to being clean). The bathroom was very clean also. Overall, everything was great and I loved Excelsior. The bus was a little annoying to take back and forth to Old San Juan though. So if you plan to go there a lot or clubbing there at night it might be better to just get a hotel there instead.

<Content>Looks Terrible!! The outside looks like they are tearing it down! When our taxi pulled up, I said, Please tell me this is NOT our hotel. It looks awful. We stayed there Nov 2004 and the rennovation looks like it's been going on for years. The check-in process took forever even though there were only 2 people in line. Our room was nice, including a refrigerator and a microwave, but it's very hard to overcome the outward appearance and the old buildings torn down around the hotel. There is a busline out front that goes directly to old San Juan for $.50. The last bus back runs at 10:30pm so it's an inexpensive way to shop old San Juan, although the area around the hotel is a bit scrarey at night. For our next trip, I will select a different hotel.

<Content>Don't Stay Here!!! I can not figure out how this hotel has a 3 star rating, half a star would be pushing it. The check-in desk employees were rude and the bell captain was not to be found. Our rooms were not ready and it took the bell captain 1 and half hours to find the time to check our luggage into storage until our rooms were ready. They wanted us to just leave your luggage in the lobby until our room was ready. As we were attempting to check-in, three other couples where checking our early because of the condition of this hotel. With the construction going on everything is dirty, the table and chairs at the pool had to be cleaned before we could set down. They don't tell you about the construction on their website. The pictures shown on the website must be from another hotel, sure didn't see anything like them when we stayed there. Our reservations were for three nights, stayed one. Transferred to the Wyndman Condado for the remaining stay. I will never even give this hotel another look next time I am laying over in San Juan.

<Content>I definitely reecommend this hotel for anyone going to PR I was a little nervous about staying at this hotel, but the $75/night price was unbeatable in San Juan, and anyway, we were only staying for 2 nights, we would only be in the hotel to sleep. When we arrived at the hotel, there was some construction next door (they're building another tower for the hotel), but their was little or no noise, the staff at the front desk were prompt and courteous, we were in our rooms in 5mins. The elevator was fast and clean, and the rooms were better than I expected. Everything clean. The view is not the best, but shouldn't be a setback....anyways, I recomment this hotel for anyone who is on a Puerto Rican budget vacation, it was great. Good staff, great location, clean rooms. We love it, can't wait to go back again !! I love puerto rico ! !

<Content>Good average hotel The Hotel Excelsior was a good middle-ground place to stay while we were seeing the sights in Old San Juan. It is just down the block from a bus stop that takes you right into the city for 25 cents. The hotel itself is fairly clean, in a pretty respectable area of town. It's not on the water by any means, but it is a good place to sleep at night while touring the area of San Juan.

<Content>Should have read the reviews first!!!! Well I have to say I wish I had read the reviews before I booked this hotel. 1. There is no where to park and they have the nerve to charge $12 a day for parking! 2. The pool is so small 10 people couldn't fit. 3. The lady at the desk was so nasty!! 4. They put so much luggage and people on the elevator at the same time that the elevator collaped!!! People were trapped 10 to be exact! They came out with blood on there cloths, the mirrors in the elevtor shattered on them!! The rooms do not by any means look like they do on there website. The rugs were disgusting, stains everywhere the furniture is old. They say you have coffee and tea in the room COMPLEMENTRY!!! No way I called the front desk and was tod they don't have any but I could call room service??? Or go to the resturant??? All I can say it you pay for what you get and you live and learn. I had my mother with me and she was asked to get out of the elevator so that they good bring up someone elses luggage to them? Have you ever???? OH AND BY THE WAY!!! The construction is unbelieveable!!! BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!!

<Content>A Waste of Money This place was truly awful. I got into town in the evening; tired and needing a shower. Not only was the bathroom filthy (the floor and the toilet looked like they had not been cleaned in months), but the hotel did not even provide a bar of soap! Thankfully, I carry my own soap when I travel! I was told there was room service, but there were no menu's in the room. I am surprised that they provided towels.I honestly wish I would have spent a few extra dollars to stay somewhere more decent. It is a sad state of affairs to spend $100 for a lousy place like this.A very creepy place.

<Content>Wouldnt Reccomend it at all I stayed at this hotel in March of 2004, I hadnt been back to PR for 19yrs. When i got in this room i was kinda thrown back. It was worse than a Motel 6 Motel. I wouldnt even rate this a hotel I would consider it a Motel. The Iron and Board are down the hall in a hall closet and that dont even work. I called the Hotel today Aug 9, 2004. I talked to the manager about my experience to see if the hotel changed any, she recommended another hotel. I told her the ceiling that was crumbling in the bathroom and the A/C did not work. She told me that she thinks her hotel was nice. I asked about the falling ceiling she once again recommended Hotel Miramar. I asked Your not even recommending your own Hotel she replied, there are a lot of hotels here in San Juan. So go figure, If you stay you wont be happy for the price thats for sure. Just my own opininon and I think it gives San Juan a bad impression on peoples perception of our beautiful Island of Enchantment. Puerto Rico itself is way worth the trip. Im returning to the Island again and definetly will be staying at a Wyndham resort for a $20 difference. Good Luck!

<Content>Don't believe the Hype!!! As I arrived at the hotel I wondered if this was for real or for fake. Don't get me wrong, the outside was ok, and the inside of the hotel was cool. But the rooms are definetly not worth the price they charge. My 2 girlfriends and I stayed at the hotel as a one stop overnighter after our cruise ended, and trust me all u want to do is a night. The rooms are a decent size, the bathroom was ok, but there was mildew on the walls of the bathroom, as well as a spider in the tub. If you stay more than a day, u must request for room service which we saw hanging on the back of the door. The outside pool or rooftop pool is really very small. Overall, we thought it was economical for us for one night, but don't expect it to be a 5 star, rather it's no star!!!

<Content>Awesome - Hotel Excelsior After all that I had read, I was quite suprized by friendly professional courteous staff, clean rooms, maid service everyday... Need I say more. We had an awesome time and would reccommend this hotel for those family oriented vacations. Not alot of hoopla around the Hotel- Quiet and peaceful. Pool was also very well kept and we enjoyed out stay. Thumbs up for Hotel Excelsior!

<Content>a nice place to stay I have stayed at Excelsior Hotel on several occasions and I am impressed with the service the entire staff provides. They are friendly and helpful. The hotel is clean and neat and you can choose the type of room you which even the floor to be on, if available. When they advertise the location of the hotel they are exactly right. The area is very safe to be in at night.

<Content>Excelsior, not worth the amount they charge. My 10 year old daughter and I stood at the Exclesior Hotel in May of 2004. Purchased the hotel through sky auction, so I only paid 50 dollars per night. Well folks that is what is was worth. The rooms were small the bathroom was not impressive. The marble vanity was broken the shower curtin was not very clean. The view, oh my god the view was of a beautiful construction site. They started working at 6 in the morning. Hello!!!! I would stay there again only in a pich. The staff was friendly and my daughter did like there small pool, but what child would not like a pool. On the go and go not worth the amount they charge.

<Content>Good place to overnight Spent one friday night in early June at this hotel on our way to St. Lucia. We were 2 families travelling together (9 total) so I booked 3 rooms trough Priceline for $70/room. Check-in was fine - our rooms were spacious and had 2 double beds, stove, refrigerator, etc. Air conditioner was great and did not hear any outside noise through the walls. The hotel is located in a business area, but we did find a Mexican Restaurant 2 blocks away for dinner and a market nearby where you could by breakfast and supplies. Also saw a few other bar/ restaurants in the area as well as a Subway. Plenty of taxis right out in front to return you to the airport. Given the cheap price and some extremely negative reviews, we were pleasantly suprised and would stay here again

<Content>Great Hotel for the price My husband and I stayed at The Excelsior for 2 nights before leaving back to Miami and the experience was fine. Let me start by saying hat we are use to expensive hotels like the Ritz, Omni, Inter Continental, Hilton. etc. and were expecting The Excelsior to be a hole in the wall for the price, but were pleasently surprised. I am originally from Puerto Rico and KNOW FOR A FACT that it is in a great neighborhood. Very busines oriented area for Americans. The room was small, but clean, except for some toilet paper in the sheets. The room smelled fine, and the AC worked great. The front desk attendents were poilet and bilingual. The loby is decorated art deco....lovely hotel. In fact, by husband and I will be staying there again next week. I would reccomend it for a short stay!

<Content>Don't belive the good reviews! We arrived late at night after a long flight. The first thing we found was the price of taxis in San Juan were as expensive as we had read about. We were taken to the hotel and out first impressions were not good. It was in a very bad part of town and we did not feel safe even though there were police cars every where you looked crusing up and down the streets. The lobby looked ok but when we entered the room it had a very strange order. The lighting was very poor in the room and the bed was so hard that we didn't sleep very well. The people in the next room were takling and the noise kept us up most of the night. The bathroom fan didn't work and you couldn't use the sink or mirror unless you closed the door the room was so tiny. The staff at the front desk were not accommodating at all. We stayed only one night before we went on a cruise and believe me we would never come back or recommend this hotel to any one.

<Content>Quite good I have been reading various reviews about this hotel. I had a chance to be in PR in July 2003. I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with 2 friends of mine.The room I got was fine and spacious. The staff even let my third friend stay without any extra charge.The only downside was the distance from the Old city (easily navigable by bus). To make it more adventurous, we walked to the old city...took us 30-45 minutes. The neighbourhood was pretty safe. I walked there alone at 3 AM in the morning (pretty deserted at that time). I used to go out every night to walk around and smoke (our room was non-smoking).Different people have different experiences. Your's might not be as bad as some of the others. Thats what I have learned in life so far.

<Content>So its not the ritz but its clean and friendly We needed a hotel for one nite before our cruise. After reading the many reviews I was reluctant but at the last minute decided to book this hotel due to its location to the cruise ships. Its located in the downtown area of San Juan. From the airport its about 15 minutes and cost us (4 people/6 bags) $16.50 in taxi fare. From Old San Juan it is an $8.00 taxi ride for 4. We arrived in San Juan at 9pm and needed a hotel for one nite for 4 (2 adults/2children). The hotel is very old, guessing from the decor the 1950s, early 50s. They were booked but because I needed two beds they upgraded us to a suite. We had a small living room; sofa, love seat, dinnette for 2, stove, frig, ironing board, hair dryer. There was absolutely no artwork on the white walls which made it look even more blah. The bedroom was much the same with the addition of a picture over each bed. There is a color TV with all the channels and gaming system for the kids. Our view was that of the building being built next door although we didn't hear any of the construction going on. But again, view didn't matter to us. The bathroom shows the age of the place as it is layers of paint which are cracked and could be picked off, especially by little hands. The toliet is what surprised me as it is one you would find in a public gas station, no tank/lid, etc. Now that I've shared all that I rated this place average even though it is old and dated because it was very clean, had a good restaurant and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The old addage: don't judge a book by its cover certainly applies here. I have seen some big named hotel chains here in the states who are on the expensive side who are not as clean as this place. The air conditioner also works very well too, and no musty smells either. We had breakfast in the parsian cafe downstairs and it was good. You have your choice from I believe 4 items for $6.90. Its more than the local denny's but not as expensive as I was led to believe by reading previous reviews. The service was great, very friendly and quick. As was the hotel staff. Upon check-in we were checked right in and in our room within 10 minutes tops. At check out it was just as good and they made arrangements for a larger taxi as we had 6 large bags, carry ons and of course our children. If you need a CLEAN place to lay your head for a quick overnite its not a bad place to stay.

<Content>LIARS, UPSET AT THE HOTEL First off they said we could have a military discount when i called for reservations,but when we got there they said it had to be booked 3 weeks in advance. the roof top pool is on the 1st level.The balcony or terrace's are little gates infront of your window that you cant go out on.The lagoon or ocean view is only if you can see through all of the buildings or go to the stairs which is the fire escapes actually and then you can see it ..i was very very dissapointed with all of it. its not in a local were you can walk to anything taxi;s are $10.00 or more..stay in condodo by the marriott and spend the extra money . The french bistro is awful, service sucks and there is no room service..

<Content>What a nightmare. It should not be listed as two star. The rug in the room was dirty, and the bathroom floor needed a good scrubing. Glasses, cups and coffee supplied were not replenished. The electrical outlet in the bathroom came out of the wall everytime you used it. Bathroom had very poor lighting. Hallways were dark and smelly. The lobby consisted of two torn chairs and one table. Valet parking will costs $12. The only acceptable feature of the hotel was the restaurant, dinner were very good, however breakfast was terrible. I would tell everyone to stay away from this place.

<Content>Good hotel for "budget" travel We stayed here for one night before leaving the Island. Used Priceline and ended up here for $95. We arrived at 3 and had to wait by the pool for an hour for our room to be cleaned. But the room was fine - tile floor, 2 small beds, a little kitchen in the closet, working TV with cable, and a table with chairs. We asked for a crib and it came right away. The restaurant downstairs is expensive but 2 blocks away is a good local place, full breakfast for under $3. There is also a nearby market where you could get food to stock your fridge with. The hotel is right on the bus route of 3 buses that will take you into the old city in 5 minutes for a quarter. We took buses both ways and were quite pleased. There were also plenty of taxis for our ride to the airport. Overall I was concerned when Priceline booked this hotel, however it was fine - nothing fancy, but much cheaper than other hotels and clean.

<Content>rather sleep in a CRACK house. Perhaps it is one? Worst Hotel I've stayed in! We had a overnite in PR 1/20 on our way to Dominica. Had previously stayed @ Inter Continental  loved it (beach, pool, gym, room) but wanted to save a little $. BAD mistake! The photo of Exclsr looked fine on net but reality was a living nightmare! Ceiling had huge water damage; looked like it might cave in! A/C was sooo musty I turned it off fearing Legionaires Disease! Room  furnishing were beaten up, wornout  dirty. Worst was when the 4 idoits next door started cooking dinner in their room at 11:15pm while we were attempting to sleep. NOISE thru paper thin walls, followed by onions  garlic stench filled our room. Pots  pans banging. THIS PLACE IS A ---- HOLE! Rather spend nite in prision. TOTAL DUMP; college dorm rooms r nicer!!

<Content>Love the Hotel, --- My job relocated me to San Juan. I needed a hotel that took pets. Surprise, the staff were pet friendly! I stayed over a month. The rooms have a little effiency kitchenette with fridge and utensils. The rooms are clean. The local community is great! grocery store, (closes early at 5:00 pm Sundays); drop off bundle laundry, local coffee shop; 2 Vets. and groomers, couple of small drug stores, a non chain car rental, couple of local banks, a movie theater, and UPS shipping store, gas station. Not a true tourist beach hotel and not convenient to those attractions. Parking is tough due to Ministery of Justice Office Bldg. down the street. But hey! this is Latin America deal with it! Puerto Rico moves on Hawaiian time here. This is the charm of PR. Yankee go home!

<Content>"Piece of crap" might be rather harsh, Brooklyn! We booked accommodation at the last minute, and for a very busy long weekend (MLK, San Sebastian festival). So with very few options available, we tried Hotel Excelsior. The $120/nt rate was not too bad (could have been worse). Admittedly, our first night was a rip off. Our flight was late and we didn't arrive until 2:30 a.m. Looking forward to a good nights' sleep, we were very disappointed to be placed in the most basic of rooms with a double bed (I had specifically requested a King), sheer curtains, no carpet on the floor, and MDF/student dorm-style furniture. However, after we expressed our disappointment, the staff arranged another room for the rest of our stay and we we were quite satisfied with it. Staff: Quite friendly Food: The hotel has a small cafe that serves breakfast and lunch. Food is okay. Wait staff is friendly (although slow service in the a.m. indicates they need more of them). Could definitely use a bigger coffee maker (long waits for them to brew new pots!) Pool: Small, clean with lounge chairs. Can sit on the bistro patio and look out over it. The hours are only 9:00 to 6:00, which is disappointing if you like to swim early or late. Summary: As one other reviewer put it, the Excelsior is not the Ritz, so if you're expecting that, go elsewhere. But if you're like us, and just want a relatively clean, reasonable, friendly place to lie your head at night, then I'd recommend giving it a go.
