<Content>Decent stay My boyfriend and I stayed here while attending a college graduation. The hotel is one of the older Best Westerns, and does not have some of the more modern ammenities that the newer ones have, but I did not have any serious complaints about the stay.It is easy on easy off the freeway, close to downtown, and near restaurants. Not far from the Dallas Farmers Market, Museums, and the Dallas World Aquarium. Bu, being that it is one of the older BW's, it felt more like a motor inn instead of a hotel.

<Content>Go Somewhere Else. Needed to stay in area for hospital. Made reservation through Expedia. Reservation was for king and double. They tried to give a king and sofa. Finally got two doubles. He told me he couldn't reduce the rate below $120 because the two double beds were actually supposed to be more. Person ahead of me got a suite for less than I paid ($99). Room didn't smell good. Air conditioner didn't work good. Finally got TV working, but it was not clear. (Snowy).Beds were clean and bathroom was clean. Will not stay there again, though.

<Content>Right palce for right Price I had to visit the baylor hospital and this people gave us a special rate. Fitzhugh Ave takes us straight to the hospital avoiding the traffic. The room are clean and the Asst Manager was there at every moment we needed anything. I would recommend this hotel if people dont want to pay extra $ just for the namesake.

<Content>Get what you pay for I found the hotel to be ok for my needs, which was going to visit a client a block away.The place isn't the Hilton, but everything I needed was there, easy access to the highway, close to places to eat, access to malls and shops just a breeze away.I would return if I needed to go back to the client, but sure enough this isn't the place to spend your vaction at.

<Content>Stay somewhere else If your luggage consists of a hefty bag then stay here.The rooms are musty smelling, the wireless internet only works if you occupy a room close to the lobby.Your clothes will carry the ambiance of your room home with them.Front office staff is uninterested or motivated in solving any problems.Buffet breakfast consists of wheat or white toast with coffee. The good news is this hotel does have a supply of Febreeze on hand and is close to some restaurantsso you can limit your in room experience.

<Content>You get what you pay for I decided to give this place a try, because it was close to Deep Ellum, and I was planning on spending most of my time there, not in the room. The price was about $30 less than, say, the Adams Mark downtown.My advice would be to spend the extra $30. The office issued us our keys, but the room was not ready when we got to it, and we had to wait. The room was in a sad state -- clean enough, but the drywall was falling apart in spots, the flourescent light in the bath was flickering and needed to be replaced, various fixtures needed to be replaced, and the bed was way too soft. Some serious cash needs to be spent on renovations.On the other hand, it WAS cheap for the area, the parking was free, the room was quiet (no noise from outside or other rooms) and the wireless internet worked beautifully. If you don't need much more than that, then this is fine. But I think most travellers should plan to spend a little more and stay at a place that's less run down.
