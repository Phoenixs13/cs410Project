<Content>Great location, Great owners, Modest / Decent Rooms I read the previous reviews before booking my 3 night stay at Hotel Gunia and I was quite pleased. The location is great and the owners are super nice...the minor drawback is the small size of the room. But hey, this is Europe, right? I would definitely stay here again and look forward to this nice comfortable hotel right in the middle of big / busy Berlin.

<Content>Great Place To Stay! Wonderful reasonable place to stay.Within a block or so of two main transportation station. Five minutes to KaDaVe and all. Yet on a quiet side street.Very spacious comfortable rooms. The hosts are some of the nicest, most accommodating people I have ever met in my world wide travel.If you are looking for 4 or 5 star luxury, go elsewhere. But if you want a safe, convenient, reasonable, comfortable, friendly spot, I don't think that you can do better.
