<Content>Elegant Hotel and wonderful location We stayed for one night in early December. We got a great rate through World Hotels. The Adler has a wonderful location right in the middle of the Salamanca area. Room was very spacious and the beds were very comfortable. Management sent a fruit basket with the largest juiciest orange I have ever seen! As I had a cold this was greatly appreciated. The decor of the hotel was very stylish. There was no outside noise and were able to get a very good nights rest. We did not eat in the restaurant as we wanted to dine before it was open. Would definitely stay at The Adler again when visiting Madrid.

<Content>Lovely Hotel While the location of this hotel is not very good for tourist, it is located near Metro and has excellent access to taxis. The hotel is quite lovely and one of the nicest rooms decors we had on our trip. Very elegant as was the neighborhood. The bar was cozy and we loved it but the service was very spotty. The few times we had a good server it was truly excellent. The concierge service seemed to be very limited and we did not like the resturants they sent us to. We learned to find our own spots in the neighborhood which were great! Staff spoke limited english so we were lucky to have a travel companion that was fluent in Spanish.

<Content>A Few Improvements Still Needed The Adler is a small hotel situated in a busy residential neighborhood. It is not close to the usual attractions of Madrid, but these can be reached fairly quickly by taxi or underground service. I actually grew to like the area as it is an older yet very upscale part of Madrid with most buildings, though dating from the mid to late 1800s, being quite well maintained and rather 'regal' in appearanceMy room was a corner room with windows facing the main street -- therefore, it was a bit noisy. The fittings in the room were acceptable, though not quite as modern as I'd like for a hotel in this category. For instance, the shower was not separate from the bathtub and the curtain didn't close properly, which meant the floor was covered with water after each shower. Internet service was bizarre; the wired service didn't work at all and the wireless only worked when I sat at the door with the computer on my lap. The bed was too firm for my liking and the duvet too thick. The room was dark enough for a good sleep; only the noise and hard bed kept me awake! Toiletries were by Etro and the housekeeping was immaculate -- one lady even wrote me a poem one morning and placed it on my pillow with a few flower petals.Other than housekeeping, service was generally poor. Other than one ebullient concierge, the rest were either ignorant of English or simply didn't wish to speak it (a frequent lament I have when traveling to 5-star properties in Spain). In fact, I would call one of these fellows downright rude and unhelpful. The restaurant is small and cozy, but service there also lacked charm. Again, basic items became complications for the service crew owing to their lack of command of English. One evening I waited at the bar for 15 minutes and no one ever arrived to serve -- even though I inquired three times at the front desk.This hotel has potential. It's intimate and downright cozy at times. However, the service needs to lighten up and smile ... and put a little 'step' into its pace.

<Content>Good hotel, location could be better Well staffed boutique hotel. Rooms pleasant and quiet - we were located at the rear of the hotel with a great view of a blank wall but the quiet suited us. Breakfast good with excellent service. However, this hotel is located a good 30-40 minutes walk (or 10 minutes by taxi) from Madrid's main attractions - Plaza Mayor, Royal Palace, etc. 15 minutes from Prado (hotel blurb says  a stones throw - maybe if you're an Olympic javelin thrower.) If you don't mind that it's a good place to stay.

<Content>A GEM OF A HOTEL IN MADRID!!! Location, location, location. Absolutely fantastic. Right in the Salamanca district near fine shops and restaurants. Also convenient to two Metro stations within 2 blocks each way. Simply one of the finest hotels we've ever stayed at in Europe! Spent 5 wonderful days in Madrid, and the service, professionalism, and attention at the Adler could not have been better. The staff is superior with one of the warmest, friendlest attitudes of any place we've ever visited in the WORLD! Save the $$$ you would spend for a room at the Ritz and stay here. The rooms are extraordinarily large for Europe with double sinks in the marble bathroom, plus ALL ROOMS ARE SOUNDPROOFED SO YOU DON'T HEAR A PEEP! The restaurant in the hotel was a little pricey, but that was completely insignificant. I can assure you that if you stay at the Adler you'll come away saying the same wonderful things I've experienced. There really wasn't anything to criticize. This place is a real find!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel -very charming This is the most charming small hotel I have ever stayed in in Europe. Beautiful lobby with no flyers advertising anything. Staff very friendly. Rooms beautiful and large -and the marble bathroom left me wanting to redo my own at home.We had fresh water and fruit  cheese brought to us as a welcome gift upon check in. The location is great, within walking distance to many attractions  parks. Great cafes on the surounding streets. I would stay here again and again. We were there in august -so there was no traffic  have no input on the noise.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel After I had already decided on staying at the Hotel Adler, I read some of the disappointing reviews and was a little hesitant about staying at the hotel. However, I found all of the negative comments to be 100% false. The hotel was extremely clean and beautiful. The staff was courteous and helpful in all situations. I arrived earlier than I expected. However, the room I requested (one on a high floor) was provided without any wait. When I returned in the afternoon, a large fresh fruit place (along with a message from the manager) was in the room. My room faced the busy street, but with the windows and shutters closed, I did not hear a thing at night. During my entire four night stay, I did not encounter one problem. The hotel is small (only 48 rooms) and if you are looking for an active lobby bar, this is not the place. However, the room was large (queen bed with a large desk, small table and two chairs for a sitting area), and sunny with the windows open. The bathroom was large (altough the counter space was minimal). The hotel is also very convenient to wonderful shopping. I booked directly through their website and found that to be the best price. I highly recommend this hotel for a relaxing, comfortable stay in Madrid.

<Content>Well below five star standard This hotel is very expensive and has many positive reviews on Tripadvisor and elsewhere. Therefore I had high expectations for my two night visit...Oh what a let down!On the positive side, the room had quality furniture and a warm and charming design style. It was modern without being cold and minimalist. The bathroom was also excellent..well almost...and the staff were friendly and helpful. HOWEVER...This hotel does not deserve five stars and falls well short of the standards required of a property at that level. The problems started when we called room service for a snack at 7pm and were told that the kitchen only opens at 8pm! This was incorrect and there was a minimal service available 24hrs, but the restaurant, where the room service calls are received, was apparently unaware of this...very odd! On another occasion we ordered dinner with wine, which arrived with no wine glasses. This situation continued with items missing from the breakfast order and a yogurt with mould growing on it. It did get so bad I was expecting John Cleese to deliver the next room service order!So other than the room service, what else was wrong?...Our room had no balcony and had a view of the walls surrounding the entrance to the car park. It was very dark with almost no natural light. I asked to change, but was informed that the only other options would either be smaller or would only have twin beds....so we stayed in the gloom!Other issues were the lobby and bar, which were sterile and totally lacking in atmosphere...They remained empty for my entire stay. There was also the shower, which was designed in such a way that it leaked water all over the bathroom floor...I could go on, but the summary is that this is NOT a hotel worthy of five stars or the prices it charges. I would not go back and would strongly recommend that others avoid this place. There are many better options in Madrid.

<Content>5 star rating and still not a sanitized bathroom I stayed here on the last leg of my trip after traveling for 3 weeks in Spain. After staying in some places that I thought couldn't even get a 1 star rating, I longed to a few days of relaxing in a five star hotel. First impression, yes, this is for the sophisticated, well heeled traveler or savvy business professional. I walked in in flip flops and a duffel bag and those around me were in Prada and Chanel. I couldn't wait to get to my room and soak in a bubble bath. I thought I had finally left all those other hotels where cleanliness was dubious at best. When I walked into my room it was indeed, very luxorious in every detail from the fine furnishings to the expensive fabrics on the bed and the curtains. Yippee, I thought!! Finally, a slice of heaven. I ripped off my clothes and headed straight for my bubble bath only to find in my 5 star hotel, two very unwanted pieces of hair which I will not describe further, but they clearly didn't come from me or the cleaning person's head. Yuck!! As an American, we have OSHA regulations and hygiene in most hotels is a given. In Spain, I found so many hotels fell short in cleanliness and this hotel, sadly, proved to follow suit. At $400+ a night, I EXPECTED a properly sanitized bathroom. I still took my bubble bath anyway, but my lasting impression of this hotel will always be a bad visual of p***** hair.

<Content>Great hotel - be carefull with rooms with traffic noise. Nice hotel, beatiful interior, friendly staff, wonderfull restaurant, placed in the middle of the wonderfull Salamanca area. However - be carefull with rooms facing the street if you are sensitive to noise. The hotel is facing the Velazquez and Goya streets which are full of traffic day and night. During my stay it was allmost impossible for me to sleep - my room was on 1st. floor.

<Content>Very Stylish Indeed I have stayed on a couple of occasions at this very stylish upscale boutique hotel , after visiting many others . It is my favourite for the utmost beauty, elegance , and orginality of its decor . It is not the usual hotel , it does advertise and it does not even have a sign on the facade ( which is beautiful by the way) . The rates are not cheap I must say , usually around 270 EUR a night, but iti si a hotel you will remember and become fond of .The location is very central in the very trendy upscale Salamanca district ( calle Goya with Velazquez- one block from Plaza Colon and Paseo Castellana) . It is an easy stroll to the Prado Museum as well .

<Content>Outstanding Hotel and Location! This Hotel is awesome! It has a highly trained staff who was friendly and extremely attentive and we are tough critics! The rooms are beautifully appointed and very quiet, even facing the main street. The bathrooms are all marble with a totally seperate area for the toilet.There is plenty of closet and drawer space, and they gave us a wonderful fruit basket upon arrival. If you call internationally, do not dial direct from the Hotel, as it is very expensive.

<Content>This is a great hotel This is a great boutique hotel. I stayed there last July during a heat-wave. But unlike most hotels in Europe during the summer, the heat was not a problem. The air-conditioning worked perfectly. Beautiful rooms. Comfortable beds, large living area, large bathrooms. I was there on business and was able to work in my room for hours without any problems (although, they did not have high-speed). The staff at the front desk was excellent. I had an emergency dental problem when I was there and they found me dentist that spoke English and was open on Saturday (amazing feat for the summer in Spain). The food in the restaurant was amazing. I loved dining there. The hotel is located in the heart of the shopping district and very close to the museums. The next time I'm in Madrid, I plan on staying there again.
