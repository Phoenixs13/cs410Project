<Content>Bueno Sin Grandes Pretensiones This is a great deal if you are a non pretencious person,and you are just lokking for a nice affordable place to stay. is very well located,kind of hide but one st walk from reforma av. and about 15 min walking to downtown,chapultepec and other nice areasclean,not fancy,minimum ammenities(just soap,and drinking water) witha nice pool onn the roof,a huge plus to relax. the staf is not bilibgul but they will try to assist you,but better practice your espa帽ol other wise not even try to communicate with themnice price,clean and plain,enough for a bussines trip or a comfort vacation hotel

<Content>Good price  The best thing about this hotel is the price and the location. It was the cheapest option among hotels close to the city center and just a block off Paseo de la Reforma. The price at the reception was cheaper than the internet rate. The room, however, has a persistent funny smell and the bathroom needs to be renovated. Reception staff are not good at English.

<Content>Corinto is a solid choice. Recently spent a night at the Cortinto with my girlfriend. We found our lodging to be clean and comfortable. The rooms are small and basic, but a good value. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel is in a good location. I would certainly stay here again!

<Content>Bad Choice ! We made a big mistake by booking in this HOTEL. Rooms are very COLD and smelly.It took us 3 nights of freezing temperatures to get an extra blanket. NO HEAT when the temperature dropped to -8 C at nite (cold wave during Thanksgiving in the DF.)The staff is not very friendly and worst of all during an emergency they DID NOT know how to make a phone call to the US.Never again. !

<Content>What a deal! I recently stayed at Hotel Corinto in Mexico City and had a pleasant experience there. This nine story hotel is located between the Zona Rosa and the Alameda Central, about four blocks from the Hidalgo Metro Station and a 20 minute walk to Chapultapec Park. Its not as convenient to restaurants and nightlife as hotels in the Centro Historico might be, but its still a nice, quiet hotel. It has a small pool and garden on the roof and a restaurant / bar in the lobby. The room was very clean and quiet. I would recommend requesting a room with a window in case its warm like the night I was there. Its a bargain for $38 US.
