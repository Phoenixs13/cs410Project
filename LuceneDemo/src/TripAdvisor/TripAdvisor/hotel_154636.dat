<Content>nice place Nice location one the most important thing in Mexico DF is a place close to a subway (metro) because the chaotic traffic, this one is close to a one of those stations, and it is 7 blocks from a big mall.Good service at the front desk, clean rooms, a little noise because it is on a heavy traffic street.

<Content>Five Star Hotel (again and again) We promised to return, and we did! This hotel continues to be Five Star to us, we are demanding passengers and frugal,don't like to pay Five Star rates. The front desk clerk remembered us! Service was great, breakfast was excellent, room was large and very clean. This time we met people from Australia and Japan. Again, we were the only Gringos in the house. You will not be disapointed in this hotel and the excellent location. The city's parks are just around the corner. We felt safe with the taxi drivers provided by the hotel. Are we returning, you bet your cowboy boots we are!
