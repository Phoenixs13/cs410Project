<Content>tiny and noisy Tiny room, shower which did not drain, noise all night long from the lane our room overlooked. The hotel is being refurbished so there are no dining facilities. Miniscule reception. Even the front of the hotel is covered in scaffolding. My husband had his drink grabbed off the table as we sat outside the hotel on las Ramblasand at 8 euros for lager he was none to pleased. I also had my camera stolen out of my bag, SO BEWARE of thieves. Not our best holiday.

<Content>Awesome Location We only stayed for one night, but were satisfied with the hotel. Very small room but nicely updated. Nicely updated bathroom as well. Both were nice and clean. Only one tiny little window looking into a courtyard. We forgot to set our alarm clock and overslept because no light came into our room to indicate it was morning yet. Perfect location right on the Ramblas. Would stay here again for the location alone! Nice stay overall.

<Content>Horrible hotel service and construction noise The Husa International does not understand the concept of customer service in the least bit. When I questioned a charge on our bill, I was given an argumentative and threatening response by their reception personnel (and I work for a four-star hotel.) In addition, there is MAJOR street construction taking place in front of the hotel and we were awoken by concrete drilling. We did not receive any apologies or offered any reconciliation for the inconvenience. I would never stay at this property again.

<Content>Great Little Hotel Hotel Husa International is small and a little tired. But it is only a 1* guesthouse. The staff are very friendly and helpful. In need of a little TLC the rooms are basic but functional. How much time do you spend in a hotel room anyway? The sheets and towels were clean what more do you want. The breakfast is reasonably priced and plentiful. The location cannot be faulted and at these prices good value!

<Content>Great location!! Modest accomodations, but worth the view!! My son and I stayed at this hotel and we had a great time. Location is very important to us and we could not have picked a better hotel for that. Husa Internacional is located directly on Las Ramblas. You walk out of the hotel and you are in the middle of everything! Our flight arrived fairly early in the day and the hotel did not make us wait until the normal check-in time. We requested a balcony room and got it.....overlooking the Ramblas. If you are expecting a luxurious 4-star hotel then this is not the hotel for you. The acccomodations are modest but clean. We did not have unrealistic expectations. Plus, how much time do you spend in your hotel room when in Barcelona???? If we ever travel back to Barcelona, we will definately stay at the Husa Internacional Hotel again, they have all the others beat with location!

<Content>Awful!! We can only say this was the smallest hotel room, shabby, dusty with the tiniest window near the ceiling. We did not stay.........the overall feeling was of a neglected building. The receptionist agreed the rooms were small but warmer - there wasn't even enough room to get into bed. The bathroom was also very tiny.

<Content>Don't stay here! This hotel is old fashioned and gloomy and not what we were expecting at all from the reviews here at trip advisor. It's as if the hotel wrote them themselves! The decor is horrible and they couldn't even give us a double bed. It was noisy and I don't see the attraction of being directly on La Rambla. I think a hostel would be better - newer facilities and a better atmosphere! Not a hotel to come to if you want to relax. BTW, don't sign for anything or hand over your passport until you've checked the room.

<Content>never again I have now stayed there for three nights and did NOT enjoy it at all. Partially this was due to the upcoming soccer game tonight which made lots of heavily drinking folks also stay at that hotel, making all sorts of noise during all possible times at night. And the rooms and doors etc do not protect one from any noise from the outside. Besides that, my room was small, very simple especially the bath, unadjustable heating requiring open windows, no TV set in my room and no other amenities. Sorry, but this was less than expected.

<Content>Top place - fantastic location and bargain price!! Just back from a stay here last week (Oct 4th - 6th) and found it to be an excellent hotel. We caught the Aerobus from the airport direct to the Placya Catalunya (only 3.75 euros each) and then it's a 5 miute walk down the Ramblas to the hotel on your left. We arrived around 11am but our room wasn't yet ready so we left our bags in a secure room and went out for a drink. Came back and checked into our room and was delighted to see it was even better than the one in the photo. Yes it was small but for the price and location it was ideal. It must have been recently refurbished as it was all dark brown wood oriental style. Bathroom was also spotless.As stated the location is fantastic, we sat at the hotel bar upstairs on the balcony overlooking the main drag of the Ramblas where we were able to watch the street performers and just generally people watch for hours. The beer in the bar was huge, we asked for a medium and it was in a large fish-bowl glass.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone purely for the cost and location. It said 1 star on the door as we went in but I have stopped in much worse 3 star hotels in the past.Only downsides were the fact we asked if breakfast was included and were told it was so we had it both days (continental) and were then charge 6EUR each per day. Had we known it was to be charged we would have probably gone elsewhere.Other is that my wifes glasses went walkabout after we left them in the room. There is a safe available in the room but you must pay extra for it so it may be our fault for not doing that but then again would you really put a pair of specs in there?The hotel were good about it and asked the maids/cleaning firm etc but they couldn't find them. Annoying yes but it wouldn't make me not recommend this hotel.Barcelona is one of the best places i've ever been!! Nou Camp tour is fantastic.

<Content>Great Location We had chosen this hotel from the rough guide which said it was ok and not the greatest, as there were no other hotels available we took it! I was dreading arriving there and to my surprise it was in a great location right on the ramblas. In the rough guide it said that rooms could be very noisy so we were dreading the night time this couldn't be further from the truth there was no noise what so ever! The staff where friendly the location great and the breakfast....I was expecting a croissant, glass or juice but it was a great spread with loads to eat and drink, hot drinks aswell! Overall I was very impressed with this hotel and plan to go back to Barcelona and will definately be staying here again.

<Content>Barcelona - Hotel Husa Internacional We stayed here for 2 nights in March 2004. Our room was very clean with TV, but had old funiture. We paid 100 Euro for a double room without breakfast. At night it is very noisy, but for two days it's ok. The Hotel is located right on the Ramblas and only a 10 minute walk away from the Place de Catalunya und the Harbor, a Metro station is in front of the Hotel (singel ticket is 1.10 Euro) near by is the Gothic Quarter. To see Barcelona, buy a ticket for the Tourist Bus (16 Euro per Person) it's a hop-on-hop-off trip and brings you to all the interesting places in Barcelona. If you want to see the Miro Museum, it is closed on Mondays.

<Content>We had a great time A group of 9 of us stayed here in July 2002 and it was fantastic! The rooms were pretty basic but had all we needed. We liked the bar and terrace that overlooked the Ramblas, great for people watching. Ask for a large beer, we've never seen anything like it. I asked for a small beer and got it served in a vase. They also do really good Sangria in a a jug. Great for young travellers and large groups. But book up early as its always booked up.Say hello to Ruben if he still works there

<Content>Hotel Internacional on the Ramblas We stayed here for 3 nights in July, 2002. The hotel lobby is very pretty, but that's pretty much the extent of the hotel. Our room was tiny (by European standards) and very moderatlely decorated. The rooms are not air-conditioned - in July air-conditioning is a must. We had to leave the windows open to get some air and it was extremely noisy during the wee hours of the night. We felt it was pretty pricey $95 USD for the accomodations. Breakfast was nothing to wright home about, but served in a nice room overlooking the Ramblas. The location of the hotel is great. On the Ramblas, near lot's of the Gothic Quarter attractions and restaurants. If you don't mind the noise, make sure to request a room with a balcony overlooking the street. Great for people watching.Have fun, Barcelona is a terrrific city.
