<Content>Valiant Attempt At Mediocrity To begin with, Guayanilla is in the middle of nowhere  is not a tourist destination; I used it as a stopover during an 8-day circumnavigation of the island. The pool was not in working order  there was massive construction going on right outside the property (they are adding a casino). The one bright spot was the restaurant which is a Meson Gastronomico  has certainly earned that certification. The property might fare better scrapping the hotel  just running the restaurant  bar. However, if it's good enough for Miss Puerto Rico to stay there (as she was during my trip)... I guess her standards are lower than mine.

<Content>Not ready for prime time My wife and I planned to stay here two nights in April, but left after the first night.Nothing went right for us here, starting when we were searching to find the place. I don't remember the details, but the address is listed as being on a numbered route. Five miles north of town we eventually admitted that we'd missed it. We came back and searched... and searched... and eventually had to call for directions. (Thank you Sprint for 'home area' coverage in PR !)The room was tiny and cramped. A huge entertainment center only took up needless space and mocked the small TV inside. There was only space for a nightstand on one side of the bed.Part of our bad experience was due to timing. The road out in front was under construction, and it felt like it would rip out the suspension of our car every time we came and went. The pool was closed for major repairs. All in all I felt like I was trapped in a tiny cell with no place to go and nothing to do but stare at the walls.On the plus side, the staff was as friendly as they could be.

<Content>Great value, location First review, and it's very good! This very clean and well-maintained parador provides great value for the money. Location was especially appreciated: it's outside the traffic congestion of Ponce, but close enough (15 minutes to parking in historic Ponce) to enjoy sightseeing, dining, etc. It's also on the west side of Ponce, providing a convenient getaway to La Parguera's luminescent lagoon and the whole southwest and west of Puerto Rico. I arrived late at night, called via cell phone for directions from Ponce, and was dreading the usual sleepy, semi-incoherent mumbles from a night clerk. However, I was quite welcomed, and obtained clear, simple directions. It turns out I didn't even need them, as this parador is very clearly signed from Hwy 2. I *highly* recommend this place! They are expanding, and deservedly so.
