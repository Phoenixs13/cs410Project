<Content>Lovely hotel nearby shopping area We escaped to Berlin for a long weekend and stayed at Kurf眉rstendamm, which is nearby the shopping area (a lot of design clothes and shoes) with the same name. This hotel is also very close to the U-bahn (tube) Adenauerplatz and to the bus stop where you can take the local bus to/from the airport. The room was large and cleaned. The bathroom was decorated in light colours and was equipped with hairdryer. And the reception staffs were friendly. Their breakfast buffet offered a lot of options 鈥?different kind of freshly baked bread, hot and cold drinks, cold dishes (ham, smoked salmon, turkey and more), cereal etcetera. The only negative side was that they did not have a smoking room, so someone smoked in the corridor outside the rooms. This hotel is really inexpensive, for the price you pay you get a lot. Recommended!

<Content>Excellent Hotel! Stayed here with my partner and 8 other members of my family this October. Arrived at Schoenefeld Airport and after some confusion about what type of ticket to purchase to get to downtown Berlin, we got to the hotel without incident. It is a two minute walk from the Adenauerplatz U-Bahn station.The hotel was exceptionally clean, public areas and rooms. Rooms were not huge but nor were they tiny and had a good sized bathroom. Bed linen changed daily and they operate the policy used by many hotels nowadays whereby if you want towels changing, leave them on the floor otherwise they will be left to be reused.Breakfast was of the continental variety with a good selection of cheeses, cold meats, fish, aswell as eggs, breads, preserves and cereals.The hotel staff were among the friendliest I have encountered and were very accommodating when I wanted to use my rusty German, encouraging and helping me where necessary. I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone and would definatley stay here again were I to return to Berlin. It is centrally located on the fashionable Kurfurstendam, and with the U-Bahn a few steps away, accessible to all attractions in Berlin.
