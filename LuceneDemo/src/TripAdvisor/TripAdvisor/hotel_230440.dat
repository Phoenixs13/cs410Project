<Content>Great location We found the NH Frankfurter Allee to be in a great location, a short 2 block walk to the U Bann Station and less than 10 minutes on the U Bann to Alexanderplatz, the main transportation center. From Alex as the locals called it, you could get to any location in and around the city by transferring to the S Bann or other U Bann lines. The staff was excellent and the room, though small but US standards, was furnished attractively and very clean. The shower pressure was excellent and the tap water very tasty even to a water snob like me. We loved the Italian Restaurant just out the door and to the right.. The markets at the U Bann Station were excellent for snacks for the room. We especially enjoyed the cheese shop and the bakery at the Real Center. Being an American ice was an issue, especially since I injured my knee and needed to ice it several times a day. The restaurant was very accommodating and provided us with as much free ice as we needed. Our son lived nearby on Magdaleninstr and we often ate breakfast outdoors at the bakery just past his cross street on Frankfurter Allee. It was a place frequented by the locals on their way to work with delicious pastries and sandwiches for a very reasonable price.

<Content>Good Option Out East! Smaller, modern hotel in eastern part of Berlin, one block from U-Bahn to everywhere with S Bahn and DB trains close by. Excellent bar and restaurant on ground floor. Credit card activated internet in lobby. Room very comfortable with modern bath. Please note: Tub shower is quite high and may be difficult for some to enter or leave without help. Very nice experience overall.Only anxiety provoking moment was on check out when desk clerk had no information that stay had already been paid for on Orbitz. After 10 minutes it was cleared up but keep your web confirmation with you and I would advise this be addressed on check-in to avoid embarassing or anxious incident when cab is waiting for airport,

<Content>Highly recommended The hotel was very good value for money. The breakfast was excellent and the situation was ideal with great transport links into central Berlin. We stayed here on our first visit to Berlin - we would love to go back and would have no qualms about staying in this hotel again. The only slight draw back was that it is by a busy road but thats to be expected in a city. However the room had great blinds and aircon. Quick tip - instead of raiding the minibar we found an Aldi supermarket in the nearby shopping arcade so stocked up on goodies there and used the fridge in the room.

<Content>Good value - bad location Check-in was very easy and, especially one of the receptionists was very friendly and helpful. When I arrived the television in the room I had booked did not work. Instead of swapping it for another tv I had to move rooms. When I got to the new room, that TV didn't work very well either, there being a loose connection for the volume. I was aiming to catch up on a bit of sleep from previous nights, hence the importance of the TV.... The restaurant looks as though it is not connected to the hotel - I didn't try it, so can't say for sure. This did mean that there was no room service. Instead I turned right out of the hotel and went to the italian restaurant there - that was pretty cheap and tasted fine. The rooms were pretty small, and the location was not so great as it was a bit of a walk to the metro station. That said, there is an enormous shopping centre by the metro station. If I got a good price I would probably stay there again, as it was comfortable and the service friendly.

<Content>Fabulous stay here We had a fabulous stay in this Hotel in early November 2007. The hotel was immaculately clean; bedding  towels were crisp  spotless and the common areas very well maintained. For such a small hotel, the toileteries provided in the well appointed bathroom were exceptional.The hotel was about a 30 minute (鈧?0) taxi ride from SFX airport.There are 2 shopping centres (Ring 1  2) a 10 minute stroll away, and there is an underground station adjacent to these.A taxi into the centre of Berlin costs about 鈧?5 and takes 10 mins.The buffet breakfasts were great; a good choice of breads, cold meats, cheeses and cereals etc, and the 2 or 3 hot dishes were refreshed when necessary.I have one small reservation about this lovely hotel; 2 of our party of 4 (myself included) found the beds  pillows to be much too soft, so if you like firm and supportive beds or suffer from a bad back, you need to think twice about staying here.We had one small problem ( a faulty safe in the bedroom) which the receptionist resolved promptly and pleasantly.All in all, our stay here was fabulous. Berlin is amazing; it reeks of history, and it is well worth taking one of the hop on, hop off bus tours if you do not have much time to investigate the city. The hotel was brilliant; spotlessly clean, well maintained and inexpensive, we would stay here again - but would definitely ask for firmer pillows.

<Content>I would go again I went on my own, and used this purely as a place to sleep. The girl on reception was the only one I spoke to, and she spoke good English, and was only to happy to come and explain how to use my room safe. I stayed for 3 nights, for my first breakfast I filled out the card left on my bed to have it delivered to my room, with coffee. Only it was delivered with tea. Not that I really cared. But I was never lefta card for the next morning, which left me uncertain if I was to expect a knock on the door or not. Breakfast never came. Which I guess is all my fault really for not making sure. Never mind. The room was very quiet, albeit a rather dull view of a car park...but with the itinery that I had there was no time for day dreaming. Location wise it suited my needs, and with the tube station just a 5 minute walk away the whole of Berlin was in easy reach.

<Content>OK We have literally come back from a two night stay in Berlin, having seen the Killers at the Treptow arenaPlusesThe hotel has like other reviewers have pointed out, excellent links to the underground/ train service. They serve an abundant breakfast buffet.Rooms are clean with beautifully smelling bath productsNegatives.The staff were not very helpful! We asked different members of staff information regarding tours of the city and they recommended a hop-on hop off tour. We persevered and asked another member of staff who helpfully told us that we had missed the booking time for a coach tour and recommended us to get to Alexanderplatz. Once we got there, the only option was the hop-on-hop off bus! For those who like ear phones that is the tour for you! People who want a true feel for the city, get to Brandenberg Gate, and look for the red tour. Not only are they free, but you get a real feel for the city, and your guide will give you an absolutely brilliant insight into Berlin's illustrious history. For the record our guide was called Annabel!Again with regards to the staff, small things such as not printing the correct number of us for the breakfast buffet/ not activating our key. The gym. It consists of three machines! A stepper/ cycle and rowing machine. The sauna is tiny! Berlin is a terrific city, and whilst I wouldn't say the hotel is bad, I don't feel it deserving of four stars.

<Content>Super Hotel Stayed in hotel from 28th December 2006 to 4th January 2007. As we are a family of five had two rooms, a double and a triple. (which was a double with a fold away bed added, so a little on the small side). Requested adjoining rooms and request was granted.Hotel was warm with plentiful hot water.Close to s-bahn and u-bahn so travel around Berlin was straightforward.Breakfast was plentiful and staff there were particularly nice. All staff spoke good English.On the down side the maid was always in a hurry in the mornings and was keen to clean room by 8am. A further problem was the bed linen was unchanged for our entire stay. Towards the end of our stay the reception area was having a major makeover...a bit dusty and noisy.However would probably stay in this hotel again and a visit to Il Mondo at the end of the road for pasta or pizza is a must.

<Content>great hotel Firstly the most important thing about this hotel is it has changed it's name to Nh Frankfurter Allee.We stayed at the hotel from 2-7 Dec 2006. We took a taxi from Tegal airport and when the taxi stopped outside the hotel I thought the taxi driver had taken us to the wrong hotel and I made him wait while I double checked - much to the embarrassment of my husband!We had a lovely room on the 4th floor with a small balcony - the whole of the 4th floor was non-smoking so there was no stale smell of smoke. The bed was the usual two singles pushed together and very comfortable and as it was too single duvets there were no duvet fights. The bathroom was very spacious with a deep bath - perfect for a long soak after going round the Christmas Markets.Breakfast was included in our booking and was very good. There was plenty choice of hot and cold food and drink and everything was very fresh and well laid out. The dining room was divided into a smoking and a non-smoking section which really made a difference.The hotel was outside the city centre but ln between two u-bahn and one s-bahn stations. On our first day we walked it to Brandanburg Gate in just under two hours. We got the u-bahn back in under 10 minutes! After that we used the u-bahn all the time and a 72 hour pass only costs 19 euro it was well worth the money. There were also very good local shops including the Ring Centre with many high street shops including HM and very good handmade chocolate shop.The hotel staff were very pleasant and friendly and as said elsewhere spoke very good english and booked our taxi back to the airport.I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Berlin.

<Content>Great Hotel. Stayed three nights from 23rd April 2006. Bit apprehensive after a bad experience in a London Best Western. However, this hotel was excellent. The position just minutes away from Berlin central on the U bahn meant quiet nights. The rooms were well decorated and equipt. The staff were helpful and spoke English. The resturant was equally recommended. I just wish we could find hotels in the Uk for this price.I recommend this hotel to all those reading this review and looking for somewhere to stay in Berlin.

<Content>Berlin is alive and very well indeed! Our 4 day break was not long enough to see everything there was to see in Berlin but we crammed in as much as we could and enjoyed every minute. The efficiency of the transport system is brilliant, the shops, the people, the bars, the restaurants, all are well worth going back for. Best Western Premier City Con hotel is very good. Helpful staff, nice, as much as you want, buffet breakfasts and everything so clean. Be aware though, that there is more than one Rathaus Strasse. I think there are about six! We went to the wrong one and couldn't find the hotel but some helpful local people put us right. We were only a short taxi ride away. The hotel has a good restaurant attached and there is a brilliant Italian place just up the street called Ristorante Il Mondo. Well worth a visit and within staggering distance to the hotel. Go on a hop on, hop off bus tour, go on a river trip, go the the flea market, go to Ka Da Ve, go up the television tower, go the the zoo, go back again!

<Content>We loved Berlin We went to Berlin in February 2005 and stayed at the Best Western Premier City Con hotel Frankfurter Allee. The hotel is 200 metres from the underground. The hotel was spotless with an excellant restuarant and it was very reasonable. On a wednesday night they have an all you can eat buffet. the food was excellent and all for 14 euros.The staff were extremely helpful. The rooms were clean and well furnished but they did not have tea and coffee making facilities though.Berlin has transport system that is excellent. We travelled30kms from the airport on a train and the underground for 2 euro's and an all day pass was 5.6 euro's.we loved Berlin!

<Content>Totally OK The Premier City-Con was a totally OK hotel. Their 4-star rating is definitely below the Scandinavian 4-star rating, probably 3 stars at the most (but hey, that goes for most German hotels). The staff are very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was really good, so was their coffee. The rooms are clean and tidy and have everything you might need. The S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations, also the tram stops are nearby. It takes only 10-15 minutes to get to Alexander Platz from there. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
