<Content>Lovely Boutique Hotel This is a lovely hotel, with efficient reception and checkin. Our room was quite large and looked over the quiet tree-lined street. Designer touches at the property are starting to age, but are still very nice. The location is terrirfic, just off Kurfurstendamm, now a pleasant tree-lined upmarket street, since all the noisy tourist action has moved to Unter der Linden. Bleibtreu street is well served by public transport, and the bus from Tegel airport stops at the end of the street. There are many restaurants around, and also a restaurant at the front of the hotel.Breakfast was really nice and included smoked salmon, toast, fresh fruit as well as the usual breads and spreads.Price is the main drawback. We only stayed here because we couldn't find anything cheaper on a busy weekend, despite booking months in advance.

<Content>Like a hostel room We had the misfortune to stay here last week. The hotel was highly recommended by the travel agent, who asked me to check out the website. The snaps on the site are very misleading  do not indicate the actual size of the room.The reception was OK  the lift was not very nice. The doors are glass  not very safe. The room itself was a shocker. It was like any hostel room anywhere else in Europe with an attached bathroom. The whole room was less than 100 sq ft. Easily the smallest hotel room I have stayed in. I am surprised at the many reviews about the spacious rooms, very misleading. We tried to change hotels the moment we saw the room  the hotel would not let us without charging the full day's stay.There was one bed (with wheels at one end)  an average mattress. There was a 14 inch CRT television (thought they were obsolete!)  a small minibar. Once I opened my bag, there was no place to move around the room. The room was extremely poorly lit  gloomy.The bathroom was about 25 sq ft  with extremely small area to shower with a grossly inadequate shower curtain which let all the water out.If this is a boutique hotel, i would much rather have the regular old hotels. Furniture, decor was also very tacky.4 star is a gross over rating (even for Europe) I have stayed at many 3 stars in Paris which had larger rooms. (and that is really saying something)The Breakfast was good  the location was great. But 160 Euro per night was a ridiculous price to pay. At 80 Euro, it would be a great place to stay. (thanks to the location  the breakfast)

<Content>Boutique type hotel off the Ku'damm Stayed with a friend here for 3 nights. Despite my friend booking via the hotel website they lost his booking, and as such had what I would describe as run of house room for the first night. Was very pokey. Looks like all the rooms were furnished with the same type and amount of furniture, and in a room this small it made it quite cramped. To the hotel's credit they moved us to a bigger room for the following two nights, which was a cavern by comparison - this was fronting the road rather than down the long corridor that runs from the street to the back of the building. Rooms come with a bar fridge with free (!) drinks like coke and sparkling water. Fridge in the first room didn't work so well, but it was so cold outdoors I just put stuff on the window ledge to stay refrigerated. There is a supermarket on the street one block west if you want more provisions.Breakfast which was included in the price was great. Heaps of food to chose from - cold cuts, cereals, fruits, eggs (cooked to your liking by the chef), toast, breads with a large variety of spreads, tea coffee and fruit juice. Was too easy to go nuts and skip lunch as a result. Definitely the best point of the hotel if you ask me. There is also a bar situated at the front of the hotel.S-bahn station (Savignyplatz) is about two blocks north over the Ku'damm, so location is quite good. There are also heaps of eating options located around the station, especially on Bleibtreustrasse just before the S-Bahn. Coming from Tegel you can either take the 109 bus which goes down the Ku'damm, or catch a cab for about EUR15.

<Content>Great little boutique hotel just off the Kudamm This boutique hotel is still a favourite of mine in Berlin. It is fairly reasonably priced for a European capital, is in a nice area with loads of bars and restaurants nearby (Caf茅 Bleibtreu, Lubitsch, 12 Apostel Italian under Savignypatz S-Bahn station arches) in the Bleibtreustrasse and Savignyplatz itself. One added extra is the free minibar contents (water, juice, coke, beer) that are replenished every day. The rooms are alternative designer chic (some of the furniture looks like it's been cobbled together from driftwood for example) and may be not to everyone's taste; ditto the bathrooms which are a bit haphazard and do tend to get water all over the place but the showers are nice even if the bathtub is a bit weird -- you'll see what I mean if you see one!The hotel has an excellent organic restaurant as well as a florist and a so-called NYC-style deli (but this has gone downhill in recent years as the choice of food has been reduced). The breakfast buffet is an excellent spread, especially if the rate includes breakfast. It is easily accessible by bus (109 from Tegel airport get off at Bleibtreustrasse ) and S-Bahn (Savignyplatz is one stop away from Zoo station). A word of warning: the pay TV channels are very easy to access so beware of any roaming fingers or curiosity about the porn channel; before you know it you're being charged EUR 13.50. Also the hotel still refuses to set aside a room to store luggage so you may check in to find a pile of cases by reception; it makes it look like a cheap backpackers' hostel, which it isn't and this is a pity.

<Content>Bleibtreu - good base Nice contemporary hotel in quiet but central location. Ground floor has trendy deli and bar -nice for a coffee/drink in the late afternoon. The rooms are not quite up to the standard as the ground floor. They are clean and large but not particularly stylish.A lot of excellent neighbourhood restaurants nearby (Lubitsch was very good). Hotel staff were very friendly.

<Content>fantastic hotel!! we stayed here during the world cup soccer in july.the staff were really nice, very attentive. the room was beautiful and big and the washroom was clean and very large. it was hot and we were a little disappointed that there wasn't any air conditioning but the staff assured us that it cools at night and we would be fine, they were right. the location is a little out of the way, but it's worth it.the restaurant was also really great, great food and staff.overall we had an amazing experience!

<Content>Great little place We stayed in this hotel and found it very pleasant. The furnishings are perhaps not as slick as your newer boutique hotels but still nice, comfortable elegant and quirky. I loved the fact that the TV could be concealed (not a TV person), and the windows could be opened (fed up of these climatised big hotels). I loved the fact that you could use the spa 24/7 and I really loved the fact that brunch is served unitl 14:00 or whenever people stop eating. Coming from London, I was really warmed by this easy going attitude. The cafe and garden downstairs is charming, the people are lovely. At around 鈧?0/ night, I also thought it was great value. Oh, and the food is pretty good too. I hear that some of the rooms can be quite small, but the one we were given was very spacious with a nice sized bathroom.

<Content>A real hidden gem Fantastic, if slightly quirky hotel. Right in the centre yet on a quiet side street (slept like a baby). Easy to get to public transport. Amazing breakfast (worth maybe paying a little more for the hotel). Warm reception, all staff so very helpful. Beds really comfortable. Accepts dogs; all in all a very personal hotel, with a great atmosphere; fantastic bar/cafe open all day. I could not falt this hotel in any shape or form and would highly recommend it.

<Content>Great little place Really enjoyed a four night stay at this small hotel over NYE. The rooms are very clean and well appointed - simply furnished, but stylish. If you're looking for a large bathroom however, this might not be the place for you, however, everything in the room worked and as long as you don't mind the bathroom floor getting a little wet from the shower you should be ok.We had a twin room on the fifth floor which had a small balcony overlooking the street which was great too. The breakfast which was included was ample and very well presented and the staff in the bar knew their stuff. They remembered us and our drink orders from each night.All in all, a great value for money design hotel and I would happily return

<Content>Quirky hotel Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Belibtreu, great little hotel just off the main Kudamm. The reception staff were very good spoke good english and very helpful. We had a room on the second floor which was at the front of the hotel but very quiet. The room was a good size as was the bathroom. Very clean and modern, need a degree in electronics to work out the lighting system but great fun. Breakast was enormous choice and very good. Would recommend this hotel for its location, staff, cleanliness, all extremely good at a reasonable price.

<Content>Nice for a motel- not a real hotel From the photos on the websites I looked it, Bleibtreu looked very modern and design oriented and like a great place to stay. Unfortunately, what I didn't know is that while relatively design oriented, the property is more like an upscale motel than a hotel. It's a very small property with even smaller rooms. While designed with a modern sensibility the rooms were extremely small (I had a single with one twin bed - awful!). The lighting is too dim in the rooms and the bathrooms, while having very pretty tiling, lacked products and amenities other than one tube of hair/body wash. There is DSL available in the rooms but 5 euro for 2 hours (almost $10). The staff waivered between rigidly Germanic and somewhat nice, but no raves here. I'll say they were perfunctory in their job performance. Additionally the cost here is over $100 euro/night and definitely overpriced. It's also really only conveniently located to the main shopping street of high end stores - if you're not interested in that it's metro or taxis. The breakfast buffet in the morning I will say was excellent. If you need a place to stay one night and you don't mind small rooms, you may not mind it, but overall I'd have to say that there must be better alternatives in Berlin.

<Content>Fun and funky small hotel The Bleibtreu is an eclectic small hotel on a quieter street just off well-known Kurfurstendamm Street in Berlin. The mosaic tiles and the carpets are colorful and lively, and the rooms are decorated by someone with a flair for the funky. The staff graciously attended to our every need.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We had a double and a twin on the non-smoking fifth floor at 鈧?26 each room per night inc a rich breakfast. We loved the rooms, which were very clean and very quiet, even on the front. There is a good lift. The people were all helpful and friendly and very stylish. The buffet breakfast contained a huge variety of items, with the chef cooking short order requests. The location is just off the Ku-Damm, and about 200m from the Savignyplatz S-Bahn which connects you direct to Schoenefeld airport and most other locations - much cheaper and more interesting than the taxi, especially with the small group card - wonderful value and available from ticket machines on any station. Loads of restaurants around, especially in Savignyplatz itself where even the 鈧?.90 3 course set menu at the Piazza was well presented and ample.For comfort without luxury, good location, modern decor, faultless service and absolutely no problems - this is the place and we will certainly return.If you have time, try a walking tour meeting the guide at 10 o clock by the taxi stand at Zoo station. It's 4 hours (with a coffee break) but not very strenuous and you get a very interesting insight to Berlin past and present, and the A-Trane is a good and safe little jazz club at the other end of Bleibtreustrasse - often with free entry.

<Content>Great Value for Money Chose this hotel after seeing it reviewed in a number of places. It is in a super location (especially for shopping  dining) and was excellent value for money, though I strongly recommend booking an executive room as they are larger. Lots of small touches make it a good cheap  cheerful hotel but don't expect bathrobes or a swell lobby. Breakfast was totally fine (no flies as someone complained about below) and service was very good. Try the restaurant Lubtisch a few blocks away on same street.

<Content>Perfect blend of great hotel, location, price... One of the best. Great location on quiet street just off Ku Damm - perfect strolling street for designer shops.Good overall design feel to the hotel. Rooms smallish but comfortable. (Be aware only 3 twins in the building!). Downstairs a combination of bar, restaurant, deli, florist and pavement cafe make this a superb base. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent (ate there twice).Easy access to all key attractions and shops and away from the noise of Mitte. Taxi ride to Brandenburg Gate about 8-10 euros.Explore the area surrounding the hotel. Savignyplatz has excellent bars and cafes. Wonderful coffee and fruity flans at Cafe Savigny (and worth checking out how far the staff can suck in their cheeks and look down their noses at you - great fun!). Zing - a new asian influenced restaurant just across the road - with outdoor dining - offers a great range of Thai, Chinese, Japanese etcOne tip - see the Guggenheim exhibition.

<Content>Flies on our breakfast.............mmmm! After having read about the Hotel Bleibtreu in the HIP HOTELS guide, I was looking forward to staying there. If you choose to stay at this hotel throughout the summer I would highly recommend that you DON'T. The rooms aren't air conditioned and incredibly hot. The temperature was soaring at 36 degrees celcius and we pretty much spent our nights hot and bothered.....and sleepless! The front desk were unable to supply us with a fan! In addition, I was very upset at breakfast times. As we all know flies love the summer. The coldmeats, salmon and cheeses weren't covered therefore flies were resting upon the food every morning. As you can pretty much imagine, we didn't feel like eating after having to look at this. The front desk weren't helpful and the rooms were way too small. I know it's always nice to stay at a 'Hip Hotel', but after this unfortunate experience I would certainly stay at a chain hotel such as The Hyatt were service and care is guaranteed!
