<Content>Rip off This is NOT THE ALA MOANA Hotel you are dealing with but a 3rd party selling their condo in the Ala Moana Hotel. We had no room service, no room cleaning and when we checked out there was no receipt given as the Hotel is really part of Jet Luxury or as they are called corporately Jet Living Our reservation specifically stated we would pay the hotel at the time of departure. The Jet Luxury Hotel is actually on line and my fees were charged to my credit card without my final approval. At no time when we booked our room did we suspect this was a third party booking agency working out of the same hotel. Their website clearly states they are a hotel only. We are now disputing the extra charges levied in the order of $165 more than our quoted amount of $129 plus tax per day. The Ala Moana`Hotel was asking $139 plus tax all in for the same room.  The hotel by the way was great and the people were also great.  Beware of Jet Living.....Jet Luxury.
