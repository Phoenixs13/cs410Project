<Content>Great pre-flight hotel Stayed at Hilton Garden Inn the night before our return flight home. I am a very picky traveler especially regarding hotels and I found this property to be very nice for this category hotel. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Beds were some of the most comfortable we have experienced at any hotel, including higher end hotels. Our best night of sleep on our 11 day trip. Great pool for this size hotel. Breakfast in the morning was very good, with excellent service. We had breakfast included in our rate of $137 per night for 2 adults, 2 children.Hotel is a little further away from the airport than other hotels such as the Embassy Suites, but only by about 5-10 mins.Not many restaurants in the immediate area other than fast food. As there is freeway access right outside the entrance to the hotel, we chose an italian restaurant Buca Di Beppo for dinner. It is about 15 min. North on the freeway. Dinner was quite good with large portions and is in a very nice area. Hotel can give you directions.When we come back for our next cruise, would definitely stay here again!

<Content>comfortable and clean We stayed at this hotel the evening before our cruise. They provided transportation from the airport. They advertised 24 hour shuttle but because of being brand new, they didn't have the need for a 24 hour shuttle so when we called the hotel upon our airport arrival, they had us take a cab. We pulled up to the hotel and they paid the driver. Check in was fast efficient and friendly. Rooms were perfectly clean and beds were comfortable. Originally I was concerned about airport noise but there wasn't any. Rooms were quiet. For the breakfast the next morning, we walked right across the street to Dennys. I would definately stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great first time stay! A brand new hotel. So what can you expect. Only the best. From check-in to check-out, everything went smoothly. Staff was exceptionally friendly. As a Diamond member from Hilton, I was very sattisfied with this stay. This was my first but certainly not the last visit to the HGI. Room was nicely decorated with flat screen tv. The bed was great. Breakfast was very good. No complaints at all. Highly recommended and good location. Several junkfood chains near the hotel, So food wise you are not going to have problems.
