<Content>Went for a conference I booked rooms for myself and several others. Check-in was not smooth and the CSR was spastic and needed the manager to walk her through step by step. The meeting space (the ballroom) on the second floor was great. The food was amazing! Everything was cooked properly and was seasoned like I would at home. The waitstaff was kind and performed seemlessly.My stay was almost ruined by housekeeping. I wanted ice. Go get the ice bucket right. Can't there are moldy grapes in the bottom. I call for another bucket. I call again. I call again. Finally someone brings me a new bucket, but they leave the old bucket with the moldy grapes and they don't leave any liners for the new bucket.I finally took the bucket with its content downstairs. I was helped by a friendly lady apologized, she later who sent Fiji water to my room. My problem was I could not even relax wondering what else wasn't cleaned...The hotel wasn't even a month old and I understand some kinks need to be worked out but I wish I wasn't involved.

<Content>Nice addition to downtown Phoenix The new Sheraton in downtown Phoenix is definitely a nice addition. It is a typical large business oriented hotel, but it has a good location and good amenities. We stayed on the Club floor - although the hotel seemed almost empty the night we were there we were put in a room way at the end of the corridor on the side of the hotel with only one small window. Nicely furnished rooms but small and with just the one small window, not able to fully appreciate the great views from the 28th floor. The Club Lounge was very nice - Stacey who works there was great!! She made our stay. Nice enough pool area on the 4th floor, but it's a little bland. Staff were great everywhere - very friendly and attentive. Cafe in the lobby with free internet (if you're a guest) was nice and the lobby bar is a good place to relax. Didn't try the restaurant, although we came back a week later at 9:45pm on a Friday night and were turned away as they were no longer serving food - not even after theater dessert. When will Phoenix start acting like a big city!Overall, decent place to stay as there are not too many options in downtown Phoenix.

<Content>Best downtown hotel by far Finally, downtown Phoenix has a nice hotel - all these years your only option was dingy old hotels, I would stay on the outskirts at the Ritz. But the new Sheraton - a Starwood hotel - just opened and its lovely, great staff and location. Restaurant had a great menu, too. Staff said the gym was amazing but I did not see it.I got upgraded as a Starwood member to a higher quality room, but to me it didnt look special, looked like a regular room, perhaps b/c there was a view they called it better. Rooms are fine - clean, moder furnishings, bright, internet access - no fridge or food drawer.Downsides are small stuff like the ironing board is miniature, seriously resembles a toy that belonds in a girls' playhouse, hurt to bend over to iron all my suits. And the iron leaks water everywhere.
