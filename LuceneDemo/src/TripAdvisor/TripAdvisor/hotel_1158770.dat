<Content>terrible... dirty and rude I went to this hotel on holiday with some friends at the end of October. We arrived in late afternoon and found a young lady at reception (probabily from Eastern Europe) who did not welcome us, slapped the keys on the counter and sort of pointed out where the rooms were.Once in the rooms we found that cleaning from previous customers had been done in a very superficial way. There was dust on every surface that is not directly in sight, the toilet had been only flushed and there was no paper.When we complained we were told that for the money we pay what should we expect.I never wrote such a negative review but this time I feel that other travellers need to be warned: stay away from here!
