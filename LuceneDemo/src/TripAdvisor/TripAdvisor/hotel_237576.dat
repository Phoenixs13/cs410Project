<Content>Venere.com and this hotel are both UNRELIABLE Our confirmed reservation via venere.com was not honored. Complaining to Venere they tell me it is the fault of the Liedesplein. I simply suggest to avoid both services. I do want, however to thank the very nice lady at the reception desk who worked very hard to find us another hotel.

<Content>HET LEIDSEPLEIN NOT FOR YOU! Don't rely on a CONFIRMED reservation if you want to stay here. Our confirmed reservation was NOT HONOURED when we arrived to check in today.On the other hand, when you arrive and your reservation is not worth the paper it's printed on, if you want help finding a hostel at an inconvenient location AFTER you arrive on a late train, and AFTER all restaurants are closed in the area, they will give you directions and an unreadable, incomplete map similar to the one they send with the reservation. This makes looking for alternate accomodations SO MUCH FUN, particularly when you are lugging baggage around.

<Content>great location but a lot of young people Leidseplein Hotel is a nice little hotel right in the middle of Leidseplein square. There are tons of little restaurants right in front of the door, which makes it really nice to go out even at night. The hotel is small but definitely ok for a stay or a couple more. the rooms were surprisingly big but the beds were kind of old. if you are not a young person it might not be the hotel you want to stay at because there are a lot of youngsters running around even at night and smoking in the hallways. I didn't mind, since me and my boyfriend were out the most time. we had a nice room with a nice view to the road with all the restaurants. we also came back again a year later and it was just fine.

<Content>Not all that bad Really good location right in the middle of the square right opposite a sports cafe showing pretty much all major events and whatever else is on. Burger king is about a minutes walk and there is numerous bars, clubs and cafes on the doorstep. Smoking is allowed in the room including weed! Hotel is a bit of a dump and the decor is very tired but room was clean enough and towels were changed everyday and for a group of a lads a clean bed and somewhere to crash were all we were really after.

<Content>Excellent party hotel! For young people who like to party and smoke cannabis in the hotel room, this place was perfect! No fuzz from management. Loud music from the street all night. Clean bathroom and shower. Comfortable beds. Good location! Not for people with high standards, but perfect for young people who want to be near where its happening.

<Content>Do Not Stay At The Leidseplein Hotel We selected this hotel because of it's location. It was the dirtiest rundown hotel we have ever encountered. We are very flexible travelers and can absorb much. The furniture was falling apart (literally a piece of the closet fell off and cut my face), there were rodent traps in the corners, the linens were beyond rundown, the toilet was broken and leaking, and the carpet worn through. The owners clearly are praying on unsuspecting travelers who choose this hotel for it's location. Do not stay here.

<Content>Would rather have slept on the pavement! Utterly abismal. The picture on the website is not even of the same building, the shower was a a cold drip, the breakfast was hard cheese, the windows wouldn't close and so it was noisy and cold, they didn't have a duvae so we had to just have sheets. I have been with 2 friends many times to the Dam, and am aware that many hotels are cheap and you often get what you pay for, and ultimately, you come back in such a state after a day out that you only want a room with a bed. Unfortunately, this hotel didn't even get that right. It's a disgrace and there are better hotels about for the same money. The only good thing is it's near a Burger King and even that was full of tramps!

<Content>Not for those with disabilities LOCATIONSlap bang in the middle of Leidseplein, next to all the night life, 2 minutes walk from tram stops. Nowhere near the red light district and a fair distance from the train station but there are regular trams to it. Great if you want to party all night but avoid if y ou like to be in bed by 10, it's directly opposite a really loud and busy club which doesnt shut up til about 3.30am and there's no double glazing.ACCESS24 hours access (you get given a front door key) although they lock the front door at 11 so if you intend to check in after that its best to ring them. Absolutely not suitable for anyone with mobility problems...its a flight of stairs to reception then another to the first floor of rooms, I think there are 3 floors of rooms so a minimum of 2 flights of stairs and no lift. The stairs are also very narrow with very narrow steps so if you are planning on going out and getting wasted be aware you will have a mammoth task in front of you getting back!STAFFWe had very little to do with them but they seemed very friendly and polite and efficient.FACILITIESRooms are basic. They are kept clean and cleaned and tidied every day but decor is tired. Bedlinen is very old and very thin (not great if you have an incredibly slow metabolism like me!) No air con, marks on the carpets but it was clean. Our window was propped open by a paving slab. TV with lots of channels including english. We had an ensuite which again was basic and old but clean and perfectly adequate. Some damp patches especially in the ceiling outside our door. Basically its an old building that probably needs refurbishing but as their main clientele are probably drunks who are going to make a mess and just want cheap accomodation why bother, it's not cost effective, the location pretty much limits it to party animals. I must stress though, the rooms were clean (and we weren't disturbed once by any other patrons). There is a bar in reception but we didn't use it and never saw anyone else use it, you're so close to so many bars why bother with the hotel one?TO BE AWAREBreakfast isn't free, they charge 5 euros a person a day. We didn't take this up as there are plenty of places to eat nearby (avoid the breakfast at the Bulldog Cafe though, it's rubbish) so I have no idea how good it is. On top of the price they charge for room there is a 5% tourist tax which is standard for amsterdam however this hotel also charges another 5% if you want to pay by your card so I would reccomend getting enough cash out (there's an ATM on the square about a 2 minute walk away but it doesn't always work)If you just want a cheap place to crash after a hard nights partying this hotel is perfect. Otherwise I'd probably suggest looking for somewhere a bit quieter.

<Content>stuff has been fixed. Everything work tv, we got hot water but that was about it we stayed on the top floor of the building so 4 flights of steep stair to climb after a nightout was the best thing in the world. Rooms were ok but it was boiling in them one window and having the door open still didnt work could get a daught up there. servic wasnt good out room never got clean bedding or towel we only got them when i manage to get from the cleaner who was 2 floors below us cleaning he never came up 2 our floor only til the day we left. Breakfast we got for free as we argue them down say our price included the breakfast so dont give in. location excellent just shame about the noise at 4am in moring with the clubs.

<Content>Not so bad Ok - other reviews make this place seem terrible. (We even stayed in the dreaded room 11!)Its not that bad. Yes the stairs are steep - but that seems to be the way in Amsterdam's pubs and houses etc. The tv required a bit of coaxing to work. B/fast was included (just the basics), we had hot water, and the dreaded city tax never eventuated. By no means is this hotel flash - more like your student mates dodgy flat - but the location is good, and the staff were helpful enough.

<Content>What is Dutch for 'Bllluuuurrrrkk'? There are many reasons to avoid this hotel. Steep stairs, no hot water over a freezing new years weekend, toilet operated by a piece of coat hanger wire that sticks out from the top of the cistern, no TV or fridge (present but faulty), steep stairs, thin walls (with or without rats), mystery 'errors' with our room rate that saw staff ask for an additional %15 after check-in. The front door is plastered with credit card stickers yet the system was out of action on our arrival we had to pay cash, even though there was a manual card swipe machine resting on the window ledge. Avoid avoid avoid.

<Content>Do not stay here This place is the pits. There was no hot water for the entire 5 days we stayed there. The TV, fridge  phones didn't work, there were no overhead lights only lamps, which did not give enough light. We had two rooms in this hostel and both rooms were as bad as each other. Our bathroom did not have a shower recess so water went everywhere, messy. We never received towels; we always had to ask after 10.30pm and then were given grief when we asked for more to clean up the water in the bathroom.The reception staff (bar one lady) were all unhelpful every time we complained about the water etc. The ended up telling us lies about things getting fixed for us to leave them alone. They also invented a tourist tax of 5%, which they insisted we pay  then denied our group of 9 of paying a deposit, which they then tried to charge us again.The location was fantastic but everything else was terrible. Apparently the place has not had hot water in over 2 months. Do not stay here; warn all the people you know.

<Content>Lousy hotel, good location Dirty bedsheets, smelly bedroom, dirty toilets, 4 flights of steep staircases...avoid it by all means unless you have the energy to climb up the stairs with your luggages! And the breakfast was not included as promised too.

<Content>Good location, terrible hotel! I am just back from staying in this hotel and it put a bit of a downer on my holiday. The website said it was an en suite room, tv, tea and coffee making facilities, breakfast included in price, and all taxes and charges were included in price.When we arrived, we had to pay city tax on top of the bill and we discovered that breakfast was not included in the price. There was no elevator in the hotel and we had to climb 4 sets of steep stairs, which was not much fun with our luggage, and going back outside was a lot of effort especially after coming from the coffee shops!The T.V in the room didn't work at all, and we complained several times but nothing was done about it. Sometimes you just want to chill out and watch some tv. It would have been nice to get a radio or something else to compensate for it, but that didn't happen.The toilet roof was so mouldy and water damaged I was afraid it would collapse on top of me any minute! Also, a hell of a lot of water leaked from the roof every night, leaving our bathroom flooded every morning. The hotel had no air conditioning, which meant staying in the hotel in 32 degree celcius heat was VERY uncomfortable.There was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, although it said there was on the web site I booked it on. On the bright side the staff were very nice and polite, but we did feel hard done by after spending 鈧?00 for an uncomfortably hot room with a bed and a flooded toilet.

<Content>Hotel to stay away from I went to amsterdam last february and stayed in this hotel. It looked quite good on from the pictures on the internet site (hoteladvice) i booked it through. For a budget hotel I thought yes that look good. That was until I arrived. It was a stale old horrible room. Nothing was working. The safe was broken and the door was hanging off the mini bar. Which looked like it was about 50 years old. We had a tv in the room but unfortunately all we could see was snow. the bed clothes were definately ancient and smelly. We more of less just slept in the room for the weekend and no more. So everybody do yourself a favour and stay well clear. There are plenty of nice clean budget hotels out there. And to Hoteladvice you should seriously review the pictures of the rooms on your site because they dont look remotely like the on i stayed in.
