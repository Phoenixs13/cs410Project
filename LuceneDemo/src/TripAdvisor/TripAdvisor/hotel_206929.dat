<Content>good value normal NH standards Stayed there for a long weekend and found the usual good NH standards, not much around in the area but did walk to Camp Nou in about twenty minutes, it is too far to walk to town center, the Barcelona open top tourist bus stops about ten minutes away, we used taxis to get into centre cost about eight euros, hotel room very clean and bathroom only had shower, breakfast very good in a very comfortable dining room, the restaurant is only open for breakfast at weekends, all the staff were very helpful and friendly, yes I would stay there again.

<Content>If you are a tourist, don't stay here The hotel is fine and clean by 3 star standards. Limmited services, huge charge for the in-room Internet and rude staff. Non service oriented. VERY far away from most tourist attractions.
