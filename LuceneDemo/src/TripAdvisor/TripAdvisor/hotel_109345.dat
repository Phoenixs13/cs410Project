<Content>Lumen is a great secret I love the Lumen, and if you like a modern boutique hotel done right, then you probably will as well. The beds are outstanding, the rooms and particularly the bathrooms are much larger than most hotels (especially compared to Kimpton's sister hotel down the street). It is definitely worth joining Kimpton's reward program because it will give you a great shot at getting upgraded I have found. The hotel does not have a pool, but you can use the Palomar's down the street which is one of the best pool scenes in Dallas on the weekends. You can't beat the location in my opinion: close to the Uptown scene but not too loud.My only disappointment is that the restaurant/bar is pretty dead every time I have gone there (always on the weekends). Perhaps it is more busy during the week. Looks great though! I stay in hotels in Dallas just about every weekend, after about 9 months of it and staying pretty much everywhere in town, I would say the Hotel Lumen is my favorite hotel in Dallas.

<Content>Wonderful experience This was my first stay at Hotel Lumen. I was in Dallas on business for four days and found my suite to be just what needed at the end of the day. I dined at Social once and had room service delivered from them once. Everything was delicious. The staff went out of their way to make sure I had what I needed. I will be staying at the Lumen again the next time I'm in Dallas.

<Content>Oasis in the desert of concrete and steel Was on my way back from a business trip when I made plans to visit friends in Dallas. My friends made arrangements for me to stay at the Hotel Lumen. A boutique hotel in Dallas? Didn't make sense to me. I came to be quite surprised. The exterior itself is quite unassuming. You almost would never guess it's a hotel. When you walk in, an instant transformation takes place: from the concrete and steel of surrounding downtown Dallas, the lobby greets you into to a quaint, trendy, stylish, and friendly oasis. Make no mistake, you feel important when you stay here.The room lent itself to an unarguable charm. Many details were taken care of. The luxuriously inviting bed and minimalist decorations hinted of a European flair that reminded me of my hotel stays in Munich, London, Amsterdam, Madrid. The tiger striped bathrobes gave a cool, funky touch.But the real treasure trove is found in the hotel's bar Social. It's charming and friendly atmosphere make you feel like a regular. I easily struck up conversations with other guests and the master bartender Lori. Speaking of, the master bartender Lori concocted a variation on an Absinthe cocktail that knocked my socks off! Wow!I will be a repeat customer.

<Content>Good experience I stayed at the Lumen for several days. This was my third time to stay at this hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated. The shower is good - once I figured out how to control it! The Social, a restaurant and bar on the first floor, has really good food. The hotel serves wine and beer for free to guests between 5 and 6 p.m. Newspapers ( NY Times, Dallas Morning News or something else) are delivered to the rooms every morning. There's free coffee in the mornings and, for the first time this year, bottled water and iced tea in the lobby during the afternoons. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. I had to conduct some business that required receiving and sending overnight mail. I also used the hotel's computer every day to check emails. The hotel is directly across the street from the SMU campus and there are many good restaurants nearby. I have nothing to complain about. This was a first class experience.

<Content>Not worth the money!!!!!!! My husband and I stayed here for a romantic getaway. We were very disappointed in the size of the rooms. The whole hotel was very dark and quite. The bathrooms were nice but the tile was broken on the floor and it look like someone stuck it back on with toothpaste. the hardware in the large bathtube kept falling off. All in all we expected more and got less. Would not ever stay here again!!!!

<Content>Better Than Expected, Great Locaction Stayed 9 days for business - liked the fact it bordered a neighborhood and I was able to get out and walk around, yet it was easily accessible to NC Expressway. Unlike some other reviewers I got a nice room with separate bathroom and a kick-ass shower. Had at least a few meals at Social which were quite good, although I think i had exhausted the menu by the time I left. The setting was cozy and intimate and I appreciated the efforts of the restaurant manager to stop by and chat occassionally knowing that I was traveling alone. Very minor complaints - walls are thin although I only had neighbors for one evening. They happened to be in the mood that night and yes I heard everything. Valet parking wasn't a big deal but I did feel a little foolish asking them to bring my car around so that I could head to Starbucks for all of ten minutes. Also found out I could have used the fitness facilties and pool at the Hotel Palomar during my stay free of charge, but they didn't make me aware of that amentity until the end of my stay (!)All and all I would definitely stay again next time I am in Dallas

<Content>Mixed experience I had previously stayed at the Palomar Hotel in Dallas many times and decided to try the other  Kimpton property when Palomar was not available. I agree with previous respondents who commented about thin walls- I was awakened 2 different nights by alarm and phone in the room next door. I did find the service to be quite helpful. I had many faxes coming with a work project and front desk was polite and helpful. The neighborhood around is very nice. Getting a cab can be tough-waited 30 minutes and was late to appointment as did not budget this much time. Room is new and nice although somewhat spartan. Restaurant food is good although service is somewhat slow with only one person serving entire restaurant.

<Content>Very Noisy Hotel The walls are very thin, so when the neighbors next door came back at midnight and talked until 2 am, I heard every word (even though I put earplugs in and had a pillow over my head). Also, my room was in the same hallway as the management offices, so during the day, there is a lot of talking and conversing back and forth across the offices, which makes it very noisy as well. For some reason, they don't close the doors to the management offices. Also, be aware that their restaurant doesn't open for lunch, so you have to grab something elsewhere for lunch. It is a pet friendly hotel, and they have a lovely dog that greets guests at the front desk...but be warned if you have pet allergies. I had read the reviews about the shower in the middle of the room - it is very odd that the shower is adjacent to the bed except for a sheer curtain.

<Content>Very Comfortable, Trendy Hotel Hotel Lumen is in a great neighborhood in Dallas. It's a very small, trendy hotel. It's extremely comfortable, and they offer a variety of different rooms.Great decor and in-room electronics (generous LCD flat-panel TVs, iPod/MP3 player compatible alarm clocks, etc.).One thing I do need to add is that a few of the rooms are NOT family friendly; some of the rooms do not have an actual bathroom... the shower is right in the middle of the room, with nothing but a glass door and a see-through cabinet hiding it. Great for singles and couples, but I don't think this room would be good for a family... I'm sure you could request a different room, though.

<Content>Great small boutique hotel in a convenient location! I was pleasantly surprised by this little hotel. The location was great - close to SMU, dining, shopping, Dallas Love airport and major freeways.The room was spacious, well appointed and the shower was gorgeous (glassed walk-in with multiple jets). I love Kimpton chain hotels and this one seems much smaller than others, but it was still really nice. I did miss the hot tub though - I usually stay a few blocks away at the Hotel Palomar which has a beautiful pool area.The complimentary happy hour was nice and the internal restaurant was good although a little pricey.The only thing I was disappointed by was the extremely slow checkout process. There was a single woman handling the experience and there were probably 10+ people waiting. She did not seem knowledgable in getting people served well nor quickly. I waited 30 minutes then just left (even though my bill was incorrect) because I had to be at a meeting. I called the hotel back from my office the next day and they were easily able to fix the issue. My checkin experience was almost as slow, but I was not in a hurry...

<Content>Great location, Great hotel We decided to stay at Hotel Lumen due to its close proximity to the family we were visiting. The hotel turned out to be great! Small hotel but great amenities. Free wine and beer in the bar nightly from 5-6. Friendly service throughout. The studio rooms are great for families. It is basically a two bedroom suite.Overall, we were very impressed with the hotel. The price was excellent, parking was cheap ($10/night and you could get it in and out as many times as you want). We will definitely stay there again!

<Content>University Park - The Place Stayed at the Lumen on a recent business trip to the Big D and found the hotel to be a little jewel across the street from SMU.The hotel is nicely renovated with lots of personal touches. Nice lobby, bar/resturant, good room,gym and great shower.Inaddition to the great decor , is the friendly staff - who go the extra mile to make you feel weclome and comfortable.The location is a little suburban, if your not attending an SMU event - but with a car your 15 minutes to trendy Oak Lawn, Highland Park Village or North Park Mall

<Content>Kimpton's Hotel Lumen -SMU Friendly! This was our third stay at the Hotel Lumen. Our daughter is a student at SMU and this hotel is very conveniently located to the campus, art museum, shopping and neighborhood dining. Excellent parking both covered and in lot next door. The front desk staff double as housekeeping in the late night and were happy to bring extra towels and pillows to our large comfortable room. We have booked another stay in January and I look forward to the comfortable beds and bed linens as well as the shower. Sister Kimpton Hotel, The Palomar, is also an excellent and slightly more upscale choice within easy walking distance to campus and shops.

<Content>Very nice small hotel The Lumen's best features are its location (directly across from SMU), the comfort of the rooms, and the presence of bigger-hotel amenities in a more intimate setting. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and the showers are, as others have observed, a fantastic experience. Flat-screen, wall-mounted TV, free wi-fi and clock radios that are also i-pod docks are all a plus. The only minus in my room was the smallish work space - perhaps the larger rooms fare better in this regard.I wasn't put off at all by the seated reception clerk, and was greeted by name by the reception desk and the car valet throughout my brief stay. I didn't mind the valet parking either, and I did not have to wait more than a minute or so for my car. Perhaps if the hotel is very full it might be different.I did not have a chance to use the restaurant, but there is a free happy hour reception daily.I will certainly return to the Lumen when I have business in the Park Cities area of Dallas.

<Content>Great Location We decided to stay at Hotel Lumen because of is proximity to SMU. The hotel was small and clean. The bed was comfortable and the location was prefect. Our only complaint was the walls were REALLY thin. We could hear the guy in the room next to us coughing ALL night long. It was so loud I felt like I was sharing a room with him!

<Content>Just what I wanted We stayed at the Lumen on Saturday and had an enjoyable time. I had no problem with the seated front desk person, or the bathroom door that didn't close all the way. I loved that it was a smaller hotel; it was quiet, and I can't say enough about that shower! I would have happily spent my entire time in Dallas just melting under those showerheads if I could. The beds were comfy, the room was clean, and the staff that we encountered we always cheerful and happy to answer our questions. I don't often have reason to travel to Dallas, but I may have to come up with one just so that I can stay at the Lumen again.

<Content>Enjoyable one night stay I was in Dallas on business in September and didn't want to stay in one of the big box hotels. I also chose Hotel Lumen due to it's close proximity to a friend's house. This hotel lived up to what I expect of a Kimpton property, smartly decorated, clean rooms and an attentive staff. My room was gigantic! I think I was mistakenly upgraded (a nice mistake!) to a junior suite, as my room had a separate seating area with its own flat screen tv and dvd player. The bathroom was huge. I really enjoyed the size of the shower. It could have accomodated at least four people. It's located across the street from SMU, so I imagine it caters to the students' parents. It's close to Highland Park shopping and about a 10 to 15 minute drive to downtown.Pricing (under $200) was actually a little less than what I expect to pay at a boutique property. Hotel Lumen is a nice change from the cookie cutter chains and you get a more personal touch. I'll definitely be staying here again for my next business trip to Dallas.

<Content>Very Nice Stay My wife and I stayed in the Lumen in August and again in September, 2007, for a total of 6 nights. We had a two-room suite both stays. The room decor and hotel decor are modern, and we found it attractive. The rooms were very clean.Valet parking is mandatory, and is $10 in addition to the room charge. But the cars are parked in the building and valet service was excellent.The two rooms were very nice and had a balcony with plenty of space to sit or walk around. The suite had a standard size refrigerator but no range. There may be a microwave, but I cannot remember at this point. No coffee maker is in the room.The staff is very friendly and courteous.We enjoyed the morning coffee and the evening wine hour in Social, the restaurant. Newspaper at your door are the Dallas paper or the NY Times.The rooms are a variety of shapes and sizes. The view to the street side toward SMU is very nice. The view to the rear is toward some homes and apartments and is okay but not as nice. You may want to call the hotel and discuss room types and locations in the building.Keep your eye on the rates. They change with demand. SMU is across the street. I made a reservation for one stay about 3 weeks in advance. By the time we checked in the rate on the website had dropped 15-20 percent, and the hotel gave the lower rate. If you are a member of the Kimpton plan, you can get a room upgrade at no charge if space is available.

<Content>Great Romanitc Getaway My fiance and I spent the weekend here - what a great stay! We currently live in different states, so pick a place for a long weekend every couple of months.This was a great getaway location for us. There were lots of things to do nearby and the hotel staff was knowledgeable about local area dining and attractions.The rooms were well appointed, and the shower was great!The only issue we had with the room were finding small ants - it was a rainy summer in Dallas and I think the ants were just looking for dry ground.The DVD library was a nice touch - we spent one evening in the room watching movies, and the wine reception was a great way to meet others in the hotel and have a chance to visit.I would definitely recomment this hotel to others.

<Content>Unbelievable Comfort/Excellent Staff At first glance, you wouldn't think my 78 year old mother would like Lumen....it's modern and, for Texas, edgy. But they accept pets, and for FREE! The bed was so divine that I'm getting one for Christmas. The staff is trained to be extra accomodating and pleasant. The only thing we missed was a coffee pot in the room. Oh yes, don't forget the evening, complimentary, wine reception. Don't let the name of the resturaunt throw you off, the food is really good. From it's name, Social, you'd think Brittany, Lindsay and Paris would be there. Not so. Just great food and service.
