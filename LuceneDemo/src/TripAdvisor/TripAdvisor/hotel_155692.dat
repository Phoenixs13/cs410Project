<Content>good value, good location We booked three rooms...some were nicer than others...but all were charged the same rate. The staff was very helpful and spoke good english. The buffet was terrible and we felt that it was overpriced at that. There is a VIPS restaurant downstairs and that is where we ate breakfast after the first morning. We are returning in 2008 and will stay there again...it was great value and a wonderful location.

<Content>best hotel in mexico city We stayed here several times over the course of three weeks in Mexico, and it was excellent each time. The rooms are large, clean and comfortable, the staff was courteous and helpful, and the included breakfast is delicious!

<Content>I changed after first night I had a whole reservation in this hotel, but only stayed the first one, then I went to another one. My company made the reservation for me, and thought, according to its name Ritz that it would be a nice hotel. It's absolutly not nice.Lobby, restaurant, bar and reception are all together in the same small room in the first floor (ground floor only for the lift and and stairs).Rooms are quite big, but furniture, carpet, bathroom and everything is so old... They have tried to renew the bathroom painting the sanitaries with white matt paint!! It looks dirty and unsafe. There is not air conditiones, but they supplie it with a fan. It's so hot that you can hardly sleep. And if you want to open the window you have to suffer the noise of all the air conditioner's motors of the buildings around.I cant say nothing about breakfast, it was not included and I went somewhere else.Well, as you can imagine I will never go to this hotel again.I have to say that it was very cheap, 30 euros/night, and that it is well situated in the historical center, but it's not worth it.I changed to Meli谩 Mexico Reforma for the following 6 nights, which has nothig to do with this, of course.

<Content>SAFE Taxi drivers I have been in your hotel from 11.-13.07.2004. Then we wanted to go to the Busstation south with an Volkwagen Taxi (my girlfriend has never been driven with an old Volkswagen).Your Hotelservice decided that we have to use your SAFE Taxis which will cost 120Pesos.At the Busstation your SAFE taxidriver charged us 140Pesos. I just had a hundred and a 50 Pesos note and the Tasxidriver told us that he is not able to change.After 5 minutes discussion with your SAFE taxidriver that we are not going to give him a tip on his not agreed Price he suddenly found coins in his taxidoor.This ist not the way we are making deals.I will never recommend a hotel to somebody if this is the understanding of service to guests you think you will never see then again.best regardsMussehlPS: 3 collegues of mine are waiting for my notes of the trip. They are going to mexice this year too. What do you think i will write about yor hotel?
