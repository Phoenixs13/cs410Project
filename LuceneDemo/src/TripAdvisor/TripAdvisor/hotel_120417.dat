<Content>Worst Hotel We arrived from the UK and as soon as i saw this hotel i cried. We checked in and went straight to our hotel room my god it was shocking. The whole room was very bad and depressing and the bedding was so dirty that i could not even stay in the room and so spent the next few hours driving looking for another hotel and this was about 11pm at night. We eventualy went back to the hotel and asked to be moved (the penthouse suite) $200.00 extra. The room was large and beautiful sea views. The wardrobe doors were hanging off, the balcony door would not shut and the room was never cleaned. The only thing that was done was that the bed was made. I went to the toilet downstairs and it smelt very bad and when i looked around the toilet seat there was ***** on the lid and around the tiles.We are just average people that just wanted somewhere to sleep and this has to be a hotel from hell. I did not think that in this day and age there could be so much filth and in a hotel too.PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL YOU PAY SO MUCH FOR HOLIDAYS AND TO HAVE IT RUINED.

<Content>OGM dont stay there.... This was absolutely the worst hotel I have ever been in !! The sign out front says Open 24 Hrs - wonder what that means... the smell of the mold and mildew competed with the smell of disinfectant to see which was strongest - had to turn off the A/C because of the dust and mold on the filter. The floors and fixtures were dusty - must not have been cleaned since the last review... we were booked by hotelscorp and they refused to move us but did cancel the deal - they wanted me to buy a timeshare and they put me in this dump ?... the night shift said they were all booked and could not change rooms . Unfortunate about this hotel because it is a great location...

<Content>Good choice on budget travel We spent two nights in the Ocean Terrace Hotel early February 2004 at a price of only 49 dollars a night for 2 people. We expected few, but got a lot. Nice, spacy and clean rooms with kitchen and freezer. Friendly staff, beautiful beach just across the (quiet) street. Many (Spanish) restaurants nearby. Far from the noice of South Beach and Art Deco District, to be reached by bus easily. We can surely recommend this hotel to anyone who travels budget.
