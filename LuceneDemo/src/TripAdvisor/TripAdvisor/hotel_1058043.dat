<Content>This is definitely not 4 star hotel! The hotel is badly managed, staff does not understand languages (apart probably Chinese). Bulbs in room are 25W what means no reading or go and buy your own bulbs. No soap and don't ask for it - it will not help! Room key = plain white plastic card + hand written room number on the piece of paper.One would expect much more from 4 star hotel in Germany!
