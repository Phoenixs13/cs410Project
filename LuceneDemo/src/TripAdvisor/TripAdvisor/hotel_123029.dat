<Content>Trouble with keys, inconvenient parking for 2nd floor... but not terrible The motel itself is clean and close to I-5, and is a good value. The key cards would consistently stop working for some odd reason, leaving us locked out of our room at 2 or 3 am and having to make a trip to the office for 2 of the 3 nights we stayed.The second floor rooms located with a poolview are far from the stairwells, so you are better off not getting one of those rooms.

<Content>OK budget hotel Motel 6 on Military Road was OK. There were 4 of us in 2 rooms. Two double beds per room. The rooms were clean but worn. The bathroom was clean but needed work (broken tiles in the shower). On the plus side were the good water pressure and temperature in the shower. The mattress was good. The sheets and towels were rough but usable. No toiletries so bring your own shampoo etc. They do supply soap.
