<Content>The other Paradiso First off, this review is NOT for the Kuta Paradiso, nor the Legian Paradiso, but rather the Paradiso Beach Inn located in Kuta on Legian street (not kidding). When I booked this reservation through Perama travel office I thought I would be staying at Kuta Paradiso, so I was a bit surprised to end up at a much smaller property. The Paradiso Beach Inn is a pretty basic midrange accommodation. LocationThe hotel is in the heart of Kuta, close enough to Bounty  Paddy鈥檚 that it is easy to stumble home after a long night, but not so close that noise is an issue. Plenty of shopping  food nearby. The hotel is a bit far from the beach, a 5 min taxi ride is the best bet.AccommodationThe rooms were clean with fridge, tv, hot water, and a small balcony. The property has a pool that was super small but refreshing for a dip in the afternoon.ServiceThe staff was extremely pleasant and accommodating. However the included breakfast quickly got old as options were limited to tea/coffee, eggs,  toast daily.
