<Content>Never stay here !!!! This place was an asolute nightmare to be a guest at. The rooms were worn and in shoddy condtion. Hotel service was rude and not at all helpful. They advertise a shuttle to the airport but use a mini-van so if its full your out of luck and on your own. I would highly reccomend avoiding this hotel if you want to enjoy your vacation or business trip.

<Content>Great Find Was in Phoenix on business and this hotel was close to the office I was working at. Decided to give it a try and am so glad I did. Hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was your average free breakfast with nice selection of pastries, waffels, and cold cereal. There is a small pool with a very nice patio area to relax.It is a little difficult to get to (it's on a frontage road next to the freeway) but once you figuare it out it is a great location. Plenty of food choices nearby with shopping and entertainment also available. This was my second stay at a Country Suites and have been happy both times.

<Content>Great Place to Stay I stayed there while on business in Phoenix. The area is really nice and there is a shopping center with a 30 screen movie theater nearby. There are many places to eat. The hotel was really nice and very clean. The breakfast offered was great with many choices (french toast, yogurt, bagels, juice, etc). Much better food than other places I've stayed. It was a little hard to find in the dark, so make sure you do your homework before you try and find it. The internet was a little on the slow side compared to my home comcast connection, but it worked for surfing pages. I would stay there again. I was there 3/26/07-3/29/07.

<Content>Beware of the security of your credit card information The owners of this property also own a Hilton Garden Inn in Avondale. We had a reservation at the Hilton that we cancelled in writing as the hotel was months behind in opening and not responsive or able to ensure that we would have a place to stay when we arrived.Apparently, this property took it upon itself, without our permission or knowledge to use our info from the Hilton Garden Inn to book a reservation at their hotel. When I responded to their confirmation and requested that it be cancelled, I was met with silence.I can understand a delay in opening, but why this property would choose to violate my privacy as well as their merchant agreement with American Express is beyond me.Why would they presume that it was reasonable for us to stay over 20 miles away from where we needed to be?72 hours before a two week business trip, I had to place a fraud alert on my Amex to protect myself.If there was a plan B for those of us with reservations, some clear communication would have resolved this entire issue. Instead, I received an email from the Country Inn threatening me with a penalty if I do not cancel my reservation 24 hours before I arrive. What if I had already left home and did not see the email in time?When I called the Country Inn and Suites toll free number, the agent indicated that she would begin an investigation - I can only hope so.

<Content>Nice place to stay We stayed at the Country Inn at the north end of Phoenix/Scottsdale. It's a clean, quiet place near shopping and the highway. It was a little difficult to find, even with the directions given. It faces an east/west freeway (I guess they call them that out there) on a one-way frontage road. Once we figured out it must be on the frontage road, we were fine. Breakfasts were decent. The room and beds were comfortable. I'd stay at this one again and will definitely give a try to other Country Inn  Suites hotels elsewhere.

<Content>Feels Like Home There voice mail messages states the Fabulous Country Inn  Suites and they weren't kidding. Wow, what a pleasant surprise. My company suggested this hotel and I can not say how business friendly this hotel is. They serve a very nice breakfast with quite a variety from Belgian waffles, sausage and eggs to bagels, yogurt and fresh fruit. I was able to enjoy my breakfast while checking my e-mail in their breakfast area, with their wireless high speed internet. I utilized the business center to print out my boarding pass which made it nice to get that out of the way. How nice that was! This has to be the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms and the pillow top beds are so comfortable. One last thing, the employees at the hotel made me feel like I was at home. Offering fresh baked cookies to me each day when I would return from work, just like I have at home!

<Content>Very Nice Hotel It was a little more than I had intended to pay, but the room was very nice. The employees were very helpful and the breakfast was good. I would definetly stay there again. It can be a little tricky getting in and out of the hotel because it is at the intersection of 2 freeways, so you have to take the backroads, but once you learn it it is easy.

<Content>Wonderful accommodations, no transportation worries. All services promised on the phone or listed on the internet were absolutely accurate. Very hospitable staff willing to assure all comforts of guests. Pleasant and comfortable rooms. Inviting fireplace in lobby. Pool and exercise room open 24 hours. Substantial breakfast included in reasonable room rate. Free shuttle to and from airport and the ski equipment rental site. Shuttle service provided to all ski areas or to the ski buses at very reasonable rates. No worry about having to do own driving on mountain roads. If desired however, rental car can be arranged at motel. Personable and considerate staff and manager. You will want to return for subsequent visits.
