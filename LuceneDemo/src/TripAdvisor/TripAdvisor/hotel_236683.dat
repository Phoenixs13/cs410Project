<Content>Lovely hotel. Just spent three days and nights at the Hotel am Dom, Frankfurt. I am 73 and was with my daughter. The hotel was lovely, everything was beautifully clean. The breakfasts were extremely good and plentiful. The hotel was situated in a perfect position with regard to the Christmas Market and shopping at The Zeil and we heard no noise at night. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and couldn't do anything more to make our stay perfect. I happily recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>A nice hotel, good location The hotel has an excellent location in center of the city, next to the Dome Church. We stayed in the hotel in December 2004 and it was a good place to visit the Christmas market, the center of the R枚mer Christmas market is just on the other side of the Dome Church. The staff in the hotel was very friendly and helpful. There is wireless internet in the hotel rooms for special fee (offered by T-mobile).
