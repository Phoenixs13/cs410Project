<Content>Not up to the mark We went there to celebrate our first anniversary. I booked it as it was recommended by trip advisor(someone on the forum). We were in a mood to splurge so my husband took the upgrade which was mentioned when we were checking in. 5 min. later we were informed that they put us in a wrong room and we need to move. We didn't like that idea and told them we will stay in the room and were then asked to pay $125 extra which we didn't agree on. The staff was nice, just like you would expect in a hotel of this class. However, when I went to the spa-to the steam room, I spent 1/2 hour but could not feel the steam anywhere and when I talked to the attendant later, she informed that it is not working properly and they have informed 2 weeks ago but has not been fixed yet. She could have told me that before I wasted my time but I think they don't want to lable things as not working. The next day same thing happened at the sauna. For internet- everytime we had to log in, we had to call the technician to get online. Talk about being nickle and dimed which I understand most of the hotels do but this was the first time I heard that I will be charged for empty cups for coffee. We recieved a card which was for some1 else- felt really welcomed after that one. When I asked the concierge to recommend something for New Year's eve, she only told me what she would want to do and didn't mention any of the parties going on in Seattle that time and the restaurant she got my reservation in, was not good at all.Overall, the room was nice, policies were not, they need to fix a lot of things. Staff was friendly.

<Content>So kid-friendly, so nice and new and clean. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Seattle with our 9 month old, and we chose it simply due to location and a mention in the NY TImes that said kid and pet friendly. It was such a wonderful experience - the hotel is brand new and so everything felt clean and that is a big plus when you have a little crawler. They were far more child friendly than any other 5 star hotel we've been to with him - a proper crib with actual crib bedding! All other hotels have used a metal folding crib with folded queen or king size sheets! The staff could not have been nicer, and we wished we could have stayed for a week!

<Content>Welcome Back Four Seasons! I for one, am very happy to see the Four Seasons back in Seattle. I used to be a semi-regular at what was the Four Seasons Olympic before they sold it to Fairmont and was so pleased to have a nice high-end property back in Seattle. I have to say, the old Four Seasons reminded me a bit of what you expect a Ritz Carlton to be like (traditional, etc.) and this one is much more in Four Seasons style (modern, sleek, etc.).Location is great, you can walk to everything and close to the city attractions, water, great dining, shopping and park activities. Be warned (as others have mentioned) it is in a mixed-bag part of the city, on one side you have the arts district but you also have an element of homeless and X rated places. This is a bit what every city has and as long as you are smart about your surroundings when going out, you will be fine. The number one thing I like about Four Seasons is the service. They make you feel special and all the little touches are especially nice (i.e. fresh ice being brought to your room each night, the turndown service, the staff being friendly and helpful). I certainly can鈥檛 complain on the rooms, they are brand new so clean, comfortable, etc. etc. The views are 鈥渦rban鈥?(even the water ones to some degree, we did opt to pay for a premium room). I have to say, however, this location compared to the old one, is better. I am not sure if the extra cost we paid for the premium room was worth it (I did not go into the city rooms) but we enjoyed our room a lot (who does not like a new room)? The restaurant was excellent, especially for a hotel. It has personality and a unique style onto it鈥檚 own. The gym, pool and spa are also nice (I utilized them all). I did use the spa for a couple of highly overpriced treatments but loved every minute of it! I used to also frequent the spa at the former Seattle Four Seasons and this one is much more ZEN and relaxing! Welcome back to town Four Seasons, hope you will be here to stay for a while!

<Content>We Loved It! We recently spent two nights in Seattle at the Four Seasons for a quick romantic getaway before the holidays. It was an incredible experience thanks to the remarkable setting and service of one of the finest hotels we have ever been to. We travel regularly, both with and without children, and have high expectations. The Seattle Four Seasons definitely met ours!Location 鈥?An ideal location for all travelers, the hotel is near great shopping, Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum, everything. The views of the city and Puget Sound are also stunning, particularly with snow falling! We walked all over the city on foot but public transportation was easily accessible as well. Design - The modern twist on the typical Northwest architecture and look really appealed to us. The use of natural resources and earth-toned materials are absolutely beautiful. The lobby is very warm and welcoming with a unique blend of wood and glass. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable - full of incredible art work and unique touches. The in-room business area is very practical with more than enough space to work comfortably. We were also impressed with the bathroom 鈥?there鈥檚 a huge bathtub, TV in the mirror, along with many other amenities. Service - The staff definitely lives up to the Four Seasons standard. Every staff person seemed to know our names, from the doorman to the wait staff to the concierge. We were in Seattle during the biggest snow storm in decades and were a bit overwhelmed by the prospect of not getting home for the holidays. The staff did everything they could to assist us in our efforts with a smile and reassuring word.Food - The food at Art was fantastic...the best tuna tartar I have ever had! We also enjoyed the mushroom risotto and family style sides to share. But the ultimate was the pot of hot chocolate and chocolate chip cookies from room service - so incredible we will forever be in search of a rival.All in all, our stay was amazing! The Four Seasons is your best option if you are in Seattle for business or pleasure.

<Content>Pity about the building work Nice hotel but as a previous reviewer said bit of a strange location next door to a few strip clubs !!! The views aren't great as the hotel is U shaped and you can see into the rooms easily. They were still building the condos when we were there and we were woken at 7.30am by the sound of drilling and hamering !! Should be a nice place when it's all finished and things have settled down. They gave us an upgrade when we checked in and then tryed to charge us for it when we checked out !! It wouldn't be my favouirte place to stay in Seattle

<Content>Great location, great service, great value. spent 3 nights at the 4S Seattle and was beyond satisfied. the location is wonderful-- both in terms of views (harbor and city)and being close to everything. the room was well-designed, very natural looking and created a really fresh and balanced ambiance. service was A+. it's everything you would expect from a 4S.

<Content>Good, but not best in class I just returned last night from the new Four Seasons Seattle. Overall, my experience was positive but not best in class. Some of this may be due to the fact that they hotel has only been open 16 days; however, they are by and large up and running. Below I share my observations and a few thoughts. EXPERIENCEArrival 鈥?the port coche is situated off the street and the doormen are prompt, efficient and welcoming. Walking through the lobby, you are greeted by a modern interpretation of traditional northwest d茅cor that felt as it might belong at the W. The ceilings are lower than I might have liked for a Four Seasons. Front Desk 鈥?Desk is efficient and friendly, I received a one class room upgrade and was quickly up to my room. They made it a point to tell me that if I removed anything from the mini-bar I would automatically be charged. I am guessing that they have had complaints about this. Room - Room is modern and well appointed with a large flat screen TV, accessible plugs, good lighting and a mini-bar. Views are nice, but look out to other rooms on the other wing of the hotel which is U-shaped. I really liked the neo-impressionist paintings of Seattle northwest scenes in the room and felt that it added to the room. The bathroom is large with a deep soaking tub and walk in shower with rain shower heads. There is an interesting partition between the toilet and shower that is a semi-translucent glass. ART Lounge 鈥?Was very busy and hard to get a table. It seemed like they were not staffed correctly for the crowd that they had at the bar and service suffered. The drinks and the atmosphere were good, but the food was so so and the portions small compared to other four seasons. I also felt that they tried to get a bit too fancy with the food and would be better to do simple well, the best example of this being George V. One other point I would make about the Lounge is that they have too many chairs in the center area, and so if you sit near the beam you will have servers continually passing between you and the person across from you. I think they would do better to get some of the chairs out of that room and put overflow people out in the lobby for drinks. Room Service 鈥?I did have room service for breakfast and find that the hotel is very strong. From the woman I placed the order with, to the waiter to the man who came to pick up the table, they were best in class and on par with any of the finest Four Seasons in the chain. The food was very good as well. Overall, the hotel reminded me of the Ritz Carlton Boston Common and the Four Seasons St Louis in design, neighborhood, amenities, food, etc. The neighborhood is fine but a bit of caution is in order in the evening. This is the first Four Seasons I have been to that is directly next to an erotic adult film movie theater. I was at the Four Seasons St Louis when they opened and would place them a half notch higher than the Four Seasons Seattle. Amongst hotels in Seattle, I would recommend to the Four Seasons and expect that they will continue to refine their service in the coming weeks and months. Many of the staff are excited to be a part of the new open and with this I expect great things when I return.

<Content>Needs Much Improvement I do not like writing negative reviews but I feel that I must be honest. We have been luck enough to stay at many beautiful 5 star hotels throughout the country, so we know what to expect. First let me say that the hotel is in a prime location and beautifully appointed. But if you stay there do not expect the service that you get with other 4/5 stars.We were very dissapointed by almost every service recieved. The climate control in our room was absolutely horrible. When we checked in the room was 61F and we turned the control to 71. By the next morning the temp was only 64F. We then turned it to 74 and the middle of the next night it was a searing 77 in our room. This made our stay very uncomfortable to say the least, when we mentioned it to the front desk they offered no solution only sorry about that, no fix for the problem or offer to move us. We had several problems with room service bringing incorrect or missing items and then one morning when I asked the gentleman to let me take the tray at the door he started to come in anyway? The gym area was also very, very warm and so uncomfortable that I had to end my workout early. The service and menu in the dining area needs major work. And upon check out we called for bell service and waited for 30 minutes. No one arrived so we called down again and were told did you call for bell service? oh really? we will send someone up we proceded to wait another 30 minutes which caused major issues with our afternoon plans. I know that your hotel is new but these are very basic things that need to be addressed right away. We were looking forward to a nice weekend the stay at the Four Seasons was a big dissapointment.
