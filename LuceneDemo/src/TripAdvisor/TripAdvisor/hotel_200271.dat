<Content>Enjoyable Stay at the Tierpark Stayed here as part of a 7 Day Contiki tour of Berlin and Prague over Christmas.Stayed in a Studio Room, which had two king single beds and a small rollaway bed. Very spacious room, with a nice entryway with a large wardrobe and storage area for luggage and clothes. Room also had a lovely lounge and sitting area, with a nice big desk.Service was lovely, on the first night I found the pillows a bit soft, we went down for breakfast and asked reception for another pillow, by the time we had come back from breakfast it was there.The restaurant is quite good, the buffet breakfast and dinners that we had were quite enjoyable, the quality of the food was good, although the offerings were a little interesting for us Australians.Would definately stay here again, although location wise its probably not what you would say in the centre of town, you would pay about 25EUR for a taxi from town or jump on the U-Bahn from Alexanderplatz and its about 10 stops.Ross...

<Content>Comfortable stay at Tierpark Arrived to the Tierpark via a taxi. Found the hotel slightly dated but very spacious. My room was a quick walk from the reception which was a great treat. Unfortunately the lock on my room was worn so the key was very difficult to use. Upon entering I found the room pleasant. We had more than enough space to drop baggage and get organized. The bathroom was small but satisfactory. We also had a mini-bar (a treat), a tv, two phones and a desk area. Our room though cold at first proved to be very warm. Hence the duvet was fine. Other customers might not appreciate the sparse bed clothes or the very thin pillows. An extra pillow would have been much appreciated. As someone pampered by American hotels the only notable difference was the quality of the bed. I slept comfortably, but would have loved to have been in a proper bed. The bar was fine for hotel standards. I could order what I wished with little difficulty (and little German). The meals were very nice. The breakfast in particular provided a great variety of foods to select. I was very pleased with the selection and the dining space. The hotel was within close proximity to transport. There was a U station that would take us to Alexanderplatz on the U5 and then anywhere we wished to go from there. Overall pleasantly surprised by this hotel as it was not my decision but rather my tour company's decision to have us stay at this hotel.

<Content>nice hotel. we got the train from krakow to berlin after our flights were cancelled,so we had to stay a night in berlin before we flew back to dublin.we got a taxi from central station to the hotel which cost around 25 euro.we picked this hotel because it was in the same direction as schonfeld airport.the lobby are is nice..very spacious and comfortable.the rooms were very big..alot bigger than your average hotel room.it was clean and had sat tv.we aint in the restaurant that evening.it was buffet style...for about 15 or 16 euro you can eat as much as you like.it was an excellent meal,great selection and great value for money.we did not go to the bar as we were too tired.the breakfast the next morning was superb..met the standards of the dinner.not sure if there is leisure facilities in this hotel.the next morning we got a taxi to the airport..it cost about 20 euro or so.good hotel for the medium price range.i think there is good connections to the city centre via metro and bus nearby.i would recommend this hotel for its comfort and food!

<Content>In The first room there were free silverfishes and a bad mattrass It was the weekend of the Berlin Marathon, so it was hard to get a room in Berlin.Sadly we booked this hotel for expensive 95 鈧?a night.In our first room we had several silverfishes in the bathroom and one mattrass had springs to be feeled very easily which punished your back.So we wanted to leave after the first nicht, but the hotel didn麓t want the refund the money for the second bight so we stayed there for that second night. We got a suite whch was good and clean and the mattrasses were ok.But it is not a courtoues behaviour of the hotel to remain on the second night.and not willing to cancel it.Also the hotel has no good looking facade.I do not know how it got 4 stars.

<Content>Quality Hotel Had a 3 night stay at this hotel. Could not fault it, particuarly value for money. Situated in the old east Berlin, 2 minute walk from underground trains, which took about 15 minutes to city centre. Never had to wait more than 5 minutes for train. Ask at reception for a 2 or 3 day travel pass, includes discounts to attractions.Do no risk travelling without tickets as inspectors do not wear uniforms.If you enjoy a good breakfast this is the hotel for you, buffet style as much as you can eat.Rooms are very clean and spacious. I would recommend this hotel for either business or pleasure.Checkpoint Charlie museum very interesting and not too busy compared to continual queue outside the Reichstag.

<Content>Great hotel in medium price range The Abacus Tierpark is an above average hotel, used by many business travellers and was busy throughout our stay. The breakfast was excellent and plentiful with lots of choice for large and small appetites but the restaurant gets very busy at about 07:30 - 08:30 on weekdays and 08:30 - 09:30 at weekends. The staff were all extremely helpful and spoke excellent english in most cases when our German failed us. The hotel is only 100 metres from the Tierpark U-bahn 5 station which takes you direct to Alexander Platz in about 20 minutes. It is worth buying a day card for travel on U and S- bahns and buses for 5.80 Euros. These can either be purchased in the hotel or on the platform at the station but the tickets must be validated by stamping them in the machine provided at the station. The only downside to the Hotel is that the location in East Berlin is not close to any of the main sights of Berlin except the Tierpark but the trains are quick, plentiful (every 5 minutes on weekdays) and very efficient. Kurfurstendamm and Potsdammer Platz were both excellent for shopping and there were just too many wonderful buildings and other sights to pick out favourites (queues to get into some attractions can get very long during the afternoons, so we found it paid to get there early) but the river trips are a good way to see everything in a peaceful setting. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would recommend Berlin for a city break and would definitely stay at the Abacus Tierpark again.

<Content>Excellent hotel! I stayed in this hotel with my mother for a short citytrip (3 nights). This hotel is marvelous! It deserves at least 3 out of 5 stars (my travelguide said 3+ stars.) The room we stayed in was huge, it was about 35 squaremeters. The room included a writing desk with stationery, tv plus tv guide, minibar, shoepolish, a press for your pants, a little sewing-box, large closet. Our bathroom was also very roomy and had a bath. Breakfast was even better: it was served as a buffet, when entering the breakfastroom, waitresses asked if you would like to have coffee or tea (and which kind of tea.) After that, the real party started, we could choose from: baked/hardboiled/soft cooked/scrambled eggs, you can put together your own cereal, yoghurt, milk, chocolate milk, all kinds of fruit, 4 types of sausages, different sorts of bread and I even saw some people enjoying a champagne breakfast! Tube station at about 200 meters. We would definately go here again!
