<Content>Very Good Great hotel. It was a little worn in the room, simple stuff like some wall covering peeling off and the baseboard in bad shape. Other than that, it was very clean and comfortable. Having the sofa bed made it easy to spread out. The remote for the TV did not work but the staff fixed it right away. Breakfast is standard, nothing spectacular. Plenty of good resturants around.

<Content>Nice This was a standard Comfort Inn hotel. I consider them to be a good deal for the money. Highlights of this one: EXCEPTIONALLY quiet. I rarely heard any noise from other guests or traffic or airport noise. Good location for getting to Irving, TX by using side streets.Only problem: Heater seemed to be malfunctioning but it wasn't too cold outside so I just didn't use it. I submitted a service request when I checked out.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This hotel was really really really clean!! The rooms are pretty big, they all have a sitting area with a couch and table. The continental breakfast was very good as well, since they had a waffle maker there, we were able to have a warm breakfast every morning. They also had the normal cont breakfast items, cereal, juice, hot cocoa, pastries, etc. I'm not sure what nights they offer this, but I saw it on Thursday...starting at 5PM they served chips, salsa, chex mix, and cokes in the breakfast area. That was nice since we didn't have time to stop for dinner that night, we just had chips and salsa. It also is surrounded by at least 20 different restaurants, some within walking distance, some it would be safer to drive, although not very far away.
