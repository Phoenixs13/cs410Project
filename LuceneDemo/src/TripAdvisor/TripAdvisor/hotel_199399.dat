<Content>Forget it or else they forget you This is actually a very nice and modern hotel in Siemensstadt, an industrial suburb of Berlin.. A benefit is the nearby metro station Rohrdamm (20 min to downtown) and the location just a few miles for Tegel airport, which is served by a hotel-owned shuttle. Rooms are large, bright and colourful and the quality of food in the restaurant is above average.. I also liked the sauna  pool area, which I enjoyed almost alone one afternoon (large pool, 2 saunas, enough beds for relaxing, fitness tools and fitness bar.At my arrival in the morning I was asked to fill in the reception forms, but then the check in procedure was postponed to 2 pm. On returning I took my luggage out of the locker, was handed over my key 鈥?again no special check in or welcome procedure, although I expected to get some breakfast/dinner vouchers etc. 鈥淭he restaurant know all鈥?was the receptionist鈥檚 answer, when I asked for the coupons.In the room I read about the group鈥檚 individualized pillow offer and, intending to comfortably watching a soccer game, asked housekeeping around 6 pm by phone for pillow #5. It arrived after the end of the game, shortly after 8 pm. At least she was not disturbed in watching her game. In the breakfast rooms with a large selection of cold and warm food and top quality fruit juices, they advertised for fresh made pancakes. I ordered one portion with maple sirup, showed my seat 鈥? And was completely forgotten. No, not completely. The same guy next morning remembered me (鈥淵ou are the guest who ordered pancakes yesterday !?鈥? and this time it worked. True not the ideal delivery behaviour to the visitor of the Berlin Logistics Convention 鈥?br/>On check-out the inevitable happened. They did not know anything about my vouchers, attempted to charge the dinner (included in my package price) to me and only gave up after consulting to more management levels, although I had the original reservation for with all details and benefits with me all the time.Let鈥檚 not forget the departure. The shuttle started with 2 people (a young lady and me) and a mass of luggage, but just 2 min before arriving at the airport the driver was told that he forgot 3 people at the hotel, obviously distracted by the beautiful lady at his side 鈥︹€?br/>Forget them at HI or else they forget you !

<Content>Good Deal for the Money I had low expectations for the hotel because of some of the reviews I had read, however, I found the hotel very decent. It was close the airport and one of the closer hotels to the Messe Sud (convention center). I was attending a conference there, so it was perfect. It was also a short walk to the subway station.All together, it was perfect for a business traveler. The room service left something to be desired, but the breakfast in the morning was good.

<Content>Not up to its rating I was rather disappointed by this hotel. Despite its 4-star rating and ambience - lots of glass everywhere - there were several flaws.The rooms had white curtains - a simple mistake that means waking with sunrise - very annoying. The rooms were not very comfortable. The staff were not very friendly, and seemed very stressed. And the breakfasts, although initially appearing to be well appointed, were actually quite limited.You can do a lot worse than this hotel, but you can also do a lot better.As regards location, you're fairly near the airport, but not near anythign else of use. About five minutes away from Rohrdamm U-Bahn station, which can get you into town in about 20-30 minutes.

<Content>The coldest week of the year We stayed for seven straight nights at this hotel during the cold last week of January in Berlin. Temperatures went down to almost 20潞C. In fact, we stayed here because last year we were at the Grand Hotel Esplanade and I mistook while doing the reservation. Still, it was a pretty good experience (even if it was not planned this way). One of the reviewers complained about the plastic matresses. They were indeed plastic matresses but it did not matter at all. Not to us. The room was nice, bigger than the one we had at the Grand hotel esplanade last year and the pool is also better, very proper and clean. The room service food was ok, the burger was terrible though. The hotel is fine if you want to do nothing in Berlin, like us, we were there just to go to the Deutsche Oper to see some Puccini operas. But it is far away from the city center, to get there you pay about 14 euros (Ged盲chtniskirche). About 16 euros to Potsdamer Platz. You can also take the underground, it is pretty close to the hotel, it is just a 5 min walk though the way is not very nice. In all, we had a good time.

<Content>plastic matresses A smart modern hotel with a great lobby, adequate rooms and a superb breakfast. It was so uncomfortable to find there were plastic matresses that we only stayed one night instead of three because of this and also because of a decidedly strange extra 20 euros on the price for the second guest in the double room while the breakfast for the second guest was free. Also didn't think 10 euros a night for the hotlel car park were justified and the area the hotel was in wasn't very pleasant when we went out to look for a restaurant.

<Content>Great location, great service We drove into Berlin last August (2002), having beenunable to visit Dresden because of the flooding. Found this Holiday Innon a beautiful quiet street in Spandau (northwest suburb). The staffwere extremely helpful, spokeexcellent English, and tolerated my German. They helped us witheverything fromfinding a self-service laundromat to calling the Deutsch Auto Club toget us a flood-free route back to Prague for our flight home. Our roomwas definitely at the top end of the Holiday Inn scale. Breakfastbuffets (included) were bountiful; one could choose amomg American style(bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, etc.) or German style (boiled eggs,rolls, jams, cheeses, cold cuts, etc.). Their indoor-outdoor Trattoriaserved very good dishes just right for late night suppers.The hotel iswithin three easy walking blocks through a very quiet, safe neighborhoodto the Rohrdamm U-bahn (subway) station, from which there is easy accesstoall parts of Berlin.
