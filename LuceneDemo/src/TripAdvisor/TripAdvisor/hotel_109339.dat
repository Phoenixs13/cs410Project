<Content>You'll Love This Homestead This Homestead was another property that has become a Homestead. The room is a suite with a completely seperate bedroom. Nice big bathroom. Comfortable couch in the living room. Two TVs, one in the living room, the other in the bedroom.Full size fridge, two burner stove, microwave, 12 cup coffee maker, toaster, and even a dishwasher! Being on the North Dallas Tollway it is a bit tricky to get to and from. It is on the north bound access road so you need to go South on the other side of the Tollway and then U turn at Frankfort to get to the North bound access road if you are coming from the North. There is a Albertson's Grocery Store very close by and lots of eating places.Staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. We visited the area for four days during Thanksgiving to visit family and friends. It was like renting an apartment for the stay. We really enjoyed our stay at this facility.

<Content>Quite the surprsie (and it's all good) I have to admit; once the hotel was revealed through price line I was wondering what I had got myself into. Because my next stop was to view the feed back from trip advisor.With only one posting from 2004 (which was very negative) I was nervous.Well I am here today, to share my experience. On Sept 12 (one night), there was nothing but great experiences - from the friendly staff, to the quite  clean property, to the spacious room, to the clean outdoor pool  outdoor hot tub 鈥? it was perfect (great for families, or like me the business traveler.All most for got to mention the free continental breakfast 鈥搃t to was great I would recommend this property to anyone hands down - great experience.

<Content>Never Again In my opinion, these people were trouble. I travel throughout the US and I have never experienced such poor service. Dirty linen was left in the middle of my room floor (for days), and garbage was left dumped over as well. Then they left linen with throw up in the middle of the hallway. No toilet paper -- the front desk told me to go find the cleaning lady [on one of the floors] and ask for toilet paper. VCR broke, lamp broke, TV did not have a battery. In front of me, the housekeeper threw the comforter on the floor, stepped on them with her sneakers, then placed the comforter back on the bed! Mold was growing on the seal and wall. Foreign hair was in my shower throughout the stay, even after they supposedly cleaned the bathroom. I was unable to connect to the internet for 3 days of my stay. The Manager does not manage the properly in a professional way -- it is more like a mom and popp shop, as opposed to a hotel for the corporate or leisurely traveler. I CHECKED OUT and found a much better place in Texas -- that is clean, with much nicer people. And now I have no complaints. After all you are spending, and you do deserve hospitality and good service. (Try the Crowne Plaza, Marriott, Best Western, Days Inn -- you are better off and the La Quintas if you are tight on money). And some of these places keep discount coupons -- so I would call them direct to knock a few $$ off. Paying the extra $10-$20 is worth not staying in a dump!! I spoke with their headquarters, and I have not even heard so much as a simple apology. or even an inquiry. NO CLASS.
