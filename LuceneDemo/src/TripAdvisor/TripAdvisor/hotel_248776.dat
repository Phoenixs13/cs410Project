<Content>Quiet location, decent accommodation Only stayed one night in the luxury room with bath - bathroom was not within the room but next door. Huge room with beds and sofa bed but 2 single beds instead of a double as requested. Dated decor but fitted with the building and makes a change to using chain hotels. Steep stairs, much easier going up than down! Quiet expensive for a 2* but was booked through VVV last minute so may be able to get cheaper rates. Located off the main street so very quiet through the night but close enough to walk to busy areas.

<Content>Good stay at the Kap We had an enjoyable stay at the Kap. Yes the stairs are a bit of a white knuckle ride and the room decor a little dated, but it does have a traditional Amsterdam house feel to it, that larger chain hotels don't. Our room was clean and well serviced.Our party of 7 booked on-line and found it good value compared to other hotels in the city. The owners were friendly and humorous, and the breakfasts simple but satisfying.The location was good for us - being slightly out of the centre allowed us some peace at night and the opportunity to experience parts of City we had not seen on previous visits.

<Content>Its alright and slightly below average My choice for hotel was, its fair to say, based on being quite price concious! This hotel fit the bill for a cheap sleep for a couple of nights and being in Amsterdam didnt think that I would take much notice of any shortcomings.The hotel has a nice location, about 10 mins from town so a good walk in day but not ideal after about 10pm especially if on your own and new to the area.I had a single room with no en suite facilities, the shower was down the corridor which didnt pose a problem. However the shower room was like a small tiled cupborad and did not smell pleaseant at all - I could not use it! I read some other reviews and was definitely aware that there were some odd smells lingering around the place but when in Amsterdam these things are bearable - for the time I spent in the room I could just about handle it and fortunately had mates staying elsewhere and so I could use their facilities.The staff who are incredibly rude and unhelpful really made it worse and hence have given me a lasting bad impression of the place. I was sure that should I have commented on the room/smell/shower then they would not have cared or felt obliged to do anything to improve on this.The hotel suits older travellers and couples and the general feeling coming from the staff toward the younger, fun seeking generation is one of disinterest and disapproving - Its Amsterdam after all - I know they see foolish, intoxicated behaviour on a regular basis but if your offering to accommodate these types of people then surely it would be something to expect. Perhaps they consider themselves to have a more upmarket affair going on - this is not the case - however nice the courtyard may be! (that nobody used once whilst I was ther - so nice but useless)!!

<Content>Another wonderful stay at the Kap We enjoyed another pleasant stay at the Hotel Kap, which has become like our home from home when we are in Amsterdam. It's always nice to greet the front desk personnel, who have come to feel like friends. Thanks for the enjoyable stay, Harry, Bruno, and Hans! The simple but nutritious and ample breakfast buffet is always a great way to start the day. Typically, there's coffee, tea, milk, cold cereal, toast with jam and butter, rusks, cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, hard-boiled eggs....The location is great: The Kap is within walking distance of the Museumplein (Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum) and the Concertgebouw, as well as Vondelpark. Also, nearby Weteringcircuit is a hub for public transport that reaches to every corner of the city. Yet because the Kap is on a tiny side-street, it is usually very quiet.Hans says that he'll be giving the Kap a complete facelift during 2008.As always, I only wish I could have stayed longer!

<Content>Problems The hotel is conveniently located for easy access to this culturally rich city. Be sure to bring the email confirmation with you. The concierge who looked indifferent and rude was charging us 18 euros per day more than the confirmed rate. As soon as I showed the email confirmation, he didn't say a word. I asked for a receipt but told me that the email was more than enough. You have to get out of your bedroom to go to the bathroom...not a good idea!J and J of New Jersey

<Content>Very Nice Value Hotel Very nice, small hotel located near most of the musuems, parks, and areas of interest. The room was ample sized, abeit a bit spartan in decor. Depending on the person at the front desk, the staff was either indifferent or friendly, but still pleasant. The breakfast was nicer than what we had expected. Overall a nice stay.

<Content>Clean, Quiet, Good Location My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at Hotel Kap. We had a double room (with shower and toilet) that looked over the courtyard in back. While not fancy, our room was very clean and we did not detect any type of strange odors mentioned in some older reviews. The beds were very comfortable and our room was scrupulously cleaned each day with fresh towels provided. The breakfast was good, and while it wasn't warm enough to dine outside, I did wander out there to pet the neighbor's cat, Freek, who was watching us eat through the window, and it is a pretty courtyard. The neighborhood is very quiet and residential, with kids out playing in the street. We did lots of walking and felt totally safe, even late at night. Beautiful Reguliersgracht is right around the corner, and there are lots of good restaurants nearby on Utrechtsestraat. We also discovered a couple of pubs we really liked in de Pijp, a few minutes walk south of the hotel near the Heineken Brewery (Cafe Berkhout and Gollem II). The staff was professional and competent, and while not overly friendly, they were polite and we weren't expecting the hotel staff to be our new best friends anyway. They did a great job of being hotel staff, though :-)!I felt like our rate was totally fair, and I'd stay there again without hesitation! Go Hotel Kap!! Keep up the good work!

<Content>Okay, but not Great This is my second trip to Amsterdam, and I'm now thoroughly convinced that all hotel rooms in this city are tiny and very overpriced. First the good part: Hotel Kap is in a nice residential street that is quiet and near the tram stop. The facade of the hotel is classic Amsterdam architechture and it is good to look at. Breakfast is decent, with an assortment of cold-cuts, cheese, eggs, bread, and cereals. Breakfast is included with the room and its served 8:30 AM - 10:30 AM. Now for the criticisms: we booked a double room and it was very small, and we paid a respectable price for it: over US$100 per night. My wife and I could hardly fit in there! There were two single beds whereas we would have preferred a single big bed, but it seems this is typical in many Dutch hotels. The staff at the front desk was not terribly friendly when we asked them some simple questions about museums and so on. I would stay at this hotel again but only if they were to lower the price to reflect the actual value.

<Content>Very nice stay. If you are looking for a leisure stay in amsterdam, we can recommend the Kaphotel.We booked a midweek and enjoyed the quietness and beauty of the street it is located in.And still all places we wanted to visit in town were at walking distance. breakfast is served till 10.30. due to the weather we enjoyed it in the pretty garden which was a great way to start the day.The room was clean and serviced everyday.Staff was friendly and helpfull and had some great suggestions (SSK restaurant, excelent food for a very reasonable price). Only disadvantage was the stairs. No elevator.But that seems to be the norm in amsterdam, and after 2 days we were fully used to it.we will return here if we ever go to Amsterdam again.

<Content>Urine Stayed at the hotel Kap over the weekend. I booked for 2 nights. I dropped my bag off in the room at midday to take in the sites of the city which are not too far away.On returning that evening the room smelt of urine. The room does not have a toilet. The shower in the corner has obviously been well used over the years. The stench was unbearable!! There is noone at reception after hours. The reception is locked. The bed is a little fold away and this was crawling with fleas!! To make my night even worse, if that was possible, a healthy rat ran right along the open window sill, which is at head level.This night was the worse night possible, I have never felt so dirty in all my life. I stood downstairs ibn the road for an hour and ventured up again. I decided not to stay the other nighht, but rather to sleep at the airport, and forego another day in Amsterdam.Hotel Kap, or room 15, that I saw should be condemned! It is not a hotel, but a doss house.

<Content>Charming A splendid little hotel. It's well-located in a completely quiet street and, once you've negotiated the traditionally steep Dutch stairs, you'll find large and well-appointed double rooms (the single room I saw looked less inviting). The coolest about the place is the breakfast room, which is much classier than you'd expect in a hotel of this kind, and boasts a great selection of food. The owner was a nice chap, too. If you're looking for an inexpensive hotel and nothing terribly fancy, I'd go for Hotel Kap.

<Content>Clean Budget Hotel Hotel Kap is your basic, budget hotel. Yes, there are a lot of narrow, windy stairs. If you can't handle it, go to a chain hotel. It was clean and inexpensive. The manager was nice. Breakfast is nothing wonderful but it's something to get into your stomach before you start your day.The only reason I wouldn't stay there again is that I would prefer something more central like Dam square. Of course that costs more money.

<Content>Nice place! I was very happy with my stay here. As a single woman traveling alone, I wanted a safe, yet cheap, place to stay. Hotel Kap was clean, quiet, has a super-cute garden area (okay the stairs are a little steep;), great breakfast and all for a pretty decent price. The location is within walking distance to all the museums also. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Can't be beat for kindness and quaintness Stayed at Hotel Kap in September 2005. Arrived with horrrrible case of jet lag...to early to check in. But check in I was allowed to do. My room wasn't ready so the wonderful gentleman at the desk upgraded me from a two-person room to a four-person at no aditional charge. I must have looked as bad as I felt! He ended up losing money on this b/c the hotel was full most of the week my daughter and I were there. Great breakfast. Can't-be-beat location. We walked to most everything but the hotel is easily accessible to tram system; on Connexxion Shuttle route. Steep steps got steeper as the week went on (no lift) but I always look for Old World, not shiny Western fare.I will definitely stay there again.

Very good for a 2 star hotel.We can recommend it.Susan and Jim Dayley

<Content>Honestly, this is not a habitable establishment Where do I start...Hotel is located in a nice location and that is the only nice thing in my review.Hotel staff is borderline rude, impolite and have no concept of service. No lift and the stairs are unbelievebly narrow and the steps are not even 9 wide and imagine carrying bags and suitcases 3 floors. One day we forgot few essentials in the room and we decided not to go back to room to fetch them. Room was small, no surprise by most european hotel standards, but the rooms were prehistoric, especially the carpet and the toilet. Speaking of small, when you sat on the toilet your face was in the sink, really, not exaggerating. Adding to this it was stinking, when we reported this to the front desk, his solution was to put some drain cleaner and that was the end of it. Breakfast - if you can call that, we skipped after first day because it was completely inedible.Please do yourself a favor and look for a decent bench in a park or a train station instead.

<Content>clean, convenient, and comfortable My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Kap for 5 days. The location was ideal for us: close to everything one would want to see and do in Amsterdam, but away from the rambunctious tourist trap areas (Central Station, Red Light, Leidseplein). With Kap as our home base, we were easily able to explore this phenomenal city by foot, bicycle, and tram. It's on a quiet street and the backyard garden was a nice touch. Hotel staff spoke English well and (with the exception of one cranky guy) were very amiable. The breakfast buffet was great; it helped to start the day off on a full stomach, especially since restaurants in the area are expensive. (If you want to save some money, there's a supermarket nearby. We bought fruit and stuff to make pbj sandwiches for lunch). We splurged on a room with a private bathroom. On the one hand, it wasn't really necessary because the shared facilities were close to the rooms and shared by only a few guests. On the other hand, I was disappointed to wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of someone throwing up in the shared toilet. Perhaps that was a one-time-only misfortune, but many people go to Amsterdam to drink and party, so I doubt my experience is all that rare. Also, note that our double bed was literally a double bed (two smaller beds pushed together) -- to sleep close to each other, one of us usually ended up in the crack. Quarters were a little tight, walls a tad thin, room rates a bit high, but that's the way it is in Europe. In a nutshell, Kap was clean, convenient, and comfortable. Overall, a decent value and lovely place to stay.

<Content>Big room Overall it was OK. The room was really big, the only problem was the bathroom. It smelled. I think it's just old and wasn't renovated for some time, so you can't clean it up to 100% any more.Breakfast wasn't very interesting.The nice thing about the hotel (but maybe it's happening in all Amsterdam hotels) the radiators were a bit warm, especially during the night. Very helpful, even though it was June.It's on a nice, quiet street, very close to the museums.

<Content>Great Hotel If You can do the Stairs Stayed at Hotel Kap for 3 nights. Not cheap but I think nothing is in Amsterdam. Rooms clean. bathroom separate but large (only our use). Breakfast very good, with choice of siiting inside or outside in the garden. My only issues were the steep stairs, as I am nervous of heights, like lighthouse stairs. (But it seems most of Amsterdam is like this, Anne Frank's house almost gave me a heart attack), and the mattress sliding off the bed gave me quite an abrupt wake up one night. Staff all male and all a bit abrupt. Overall, a very good hotel.

The patio was really good for realaxing during the evening and the staff were helpfull and the room was always cleaned. Just one thing the mattresses slip off the beds a little but this is a very minor complaint for such a good hotel.

<Content>Super Value - Great location - Will Definitely Book Again!! Excellent value hotel in a very quiet leafy suburban street. Within easy reach of all the major attractions, either by foot or public transport. Nearest tram stop is 2 minutes walk.Room and bathroom were very clean. Superb breakfast with choice of cereals, toast, preserves, ham, cheese, eggs, tea/coffee, juice, fruit.....wow!! We had a room on the street side and the only noise you could hear was the occasional tram bell. Den Tex Straat is a one way street containing a mixture of small hotels and residences. Hardly any passing traffic at all.The staircase is a little steep and there's no elevator....but I think that's part of the fun with Amsterdam townhouses.Staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Highly recommended!

<Content>Great Location, Staff and Price I've stayed at the Kap twice and have booked in a third time. Staff is friendly and helpful and multilingual. The rooms are clean and ours had a Vincent Van Gogh print that I loved. Breakfast is plentiful with lots of choice - ham, cheese, eggs, toast, fruit...The location is unbeatable - everyplace is within a 20 minute walk and most everywhere is much less. Great restaurants on all sides, but you have to walk a block or two to discover most of them. But, there are dozens. The beautiful Reguliersgracht canal is 2 short blocks away and leads peacefully and beautifully into the heart of old Amsterdam.The inside rooms facing the courtyard are quiet, quiet, quieter. Unfortunately, the Den Texstraat street side picks up all the noise of this minor and seemingly quiet street. So when the single motorcycle goes by you wake up with a start. When the revellers who have outlasted me return at 4 am and 5am and 6am on the weekend, you hear it! Get an inside room and there's no place else in Amsterdam I'd even consider. Wonderful.However, if you need an elevator, this isn't he place for you. They don't have one.

<Content>Great Location! This is a smaller hotel located a very short walk from the major museums and near the brewery and near the Asterisk Hotel. It is located on a very quiet pleasant residential street.Pros: The hotel and the room was, in general, very clean and nice. The en suite facilites were nice and worked well. By Amsterdam standards, the facility was fairly smoke free. Breakfast area was very nice and the food decent. You are provided with a key to both the front door and your room. The staff were *very* helpful and efficient (and helped address a medical issue that poped up). The rooms were very quiet (yes, the occasional guest let his/her door slam) with zero street noise. By Amsterdam standards, the stairs were fairly easy. Lots of TV channels is lots of languages...The location was great -- right on several major tram lines (16, 24 and 25) -- make it easy to get to centraal station and old town. It is also a reasonable walk to the center of town (30 minutes?) or Rembranstplein (10 minutes?). The Rijks is no more than a five to seven minute walk. Small shops and restaurants also close by.Overall, a great value.Cons: The carpeting is less than ideal. It was cheap carpet to begin with and has become stained over time. Room lighting could be better at night (although that huge window is great during the day!).

<Content>loved the kaphotel I think the previous reviewer put her comments with the wrong hotel.We stayed at the Kap 3 weeks ago and had a great time. The room was big and cozy with red carpeting and modern chandeliers, the beds were comfortable box spring beds.The bathroom was large and comfortable and everything very clean. The breakfast was a great surprise with various breads and a large selection of preserves.Ham, cheese and another kind of meat,Eggs still warm in the basket,canned and fresh fruit.Cereal.Cucumber,tomatoes and pickels.And plenty of coffee,tea,OJ and milk.We even had the breakfast, due to the good weather in the beautifull patio/garden in the back.Overall much better and cheaper than the hotel in London we stayed in before this hotel.And the staff was very friendly and helpfull.By the sound of it the milk was not the only thing that was 'off'We can surely recommend this hotelBryan and Sue

<Content>Awful Stay at Hotel Kap The breakfast was horrible, just cereal, toast and tea with stale milk. The shower leaked through the ceiling which we were made to feel guilty about... it wasn't our fault! The double bed was made up of two single mattresses on a double base which were very soft and kept slipping off the base during the night. The hotel was also very noisy at night and in the morning with furniture being moved around above our room. People were also slamming dorrs throughout the night. Therefore my partner didn't get much sleep. We won't be recommending this hotel to anyone! It was awful!

<Content>Good hotel for a good price We stayed there for four days and had a great time.The room was big and cosy. The street is very quiet but right in the middle of everything.The bathroom was very clean and the brakfast was fantastic!We highly recommend this hotel, it has everything you need and it's really not expensive.
