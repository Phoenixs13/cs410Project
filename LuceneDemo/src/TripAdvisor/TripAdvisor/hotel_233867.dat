<Content>We had a great Christmas in Berlin Four of us stayed in two rooms in December 2008 and it was great.Despite the fall in the purchasing power of sterling, I thought the rooms were good value. We had one double with shower and one twin with bath. Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. No kettle (we are heavy tea-drinkers) but a minibar.Free breakfast was included in our package. There aren't that many tables, but as guests were coming down at different times we never had to wait long. Don't expect top quality food and service but we helped ourselves to plenty of fruit, egg, bacon, etc.Reception were very friendly and helfpul, and spoke good English.The location is excellent for tourists visiting Berlin, some attractions close by and a short walk from the zoo station with S Bahn, U Bahn and bus connections around the city. At the station we saw people drifting around the concourse a couple of times, but we had no trouble and the hotel street is quiet and pleasant.

<Content>Great price, great location A very pleasant little hotel, handy for Zoo station, KuDamm, and the the various restaurants of Savigny Platz area. The staff were unfailingly polite, cheerful and helpful, and the rooms modern and clean. The only minor gripes would be the small breakfast area, best to avoid the 08.30 to 09.00 rush times, or you might have to wait for a table. Also, the beds were a bit firm and on the small side, especially if you are over 6ft - however, after a heavy days sightseeing, and an ample intake of Berlins famous hopitality, I slept like a log.

<Content>A Wunderbar Find We had a great stay at the Astoria. An earlier review was right when they said the happiest man works here. The staff were friendly, the hotel was spotless and the breakfast was tasty. The hotel is in a great location-a 5 minute walk from Zoo station and bus stops.

<Content>Loved this Hotel This is a fantasic hotel. The location is perfect .walking distance from the train station,just off the main shopping street.Although a busy area the traffic didn't bother us at all (good windows) that kept the traffic noise out. It is spotlesly clean,the rooms are a good size and the bathroom was very big. The breakfast was better than any I have had when been on city breaksand I have stayed in bigger hotels and paid a lot more money and got less than this hotel offers.The staff are very pleasent and helpful,There is in particular one member of staff I didnt get his name but he must be the happiest man alive he is lovely. Out of 5 I would give this hotel 5. Its great.

<Content>Good hotel We spent holidays here.It is beautiful small hotel with very good location. It is situated in the center of the city. It takes about 7 minutes to get the railway station and underground station Zoo by feet. The room is spacious and clean. The breakfast buffet is very good (it's included hot and cold dishes).The staff is very helpful and kind.It is very nice hotel for reasonable prise.

<Content>Convenient; good breakfast;small room The other reviews are still accurate; this is a friendly, well-located, clean place, with very good breakfast buffet. The bathroom and closet space are ample, but the room where I stayed was tight. I found the chairs remarkably uncomfortable, and there was no where to unpack or store a suitcase other than on the bed linen or one of the two chairs (which made them useful for something!). This boutique hotel, near all public transport, at a reasonable price, is a great choice in Berlin, but don't expect to have any space to spread out at the Astoria.

<Content>The Happiest Man Alive Works Here! From the perfect little breakfasts to the beautiful rooms, this hotel cannot be beat. We, two-traveling students, have stayed in many European hotels over the past 3 months, and this one was by far, the best! The staff was incredibly accomodating; they taught us german, looked up english movie times, and greeted us happily with a smile upon each re-entry or exit. We would reccommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. It's safe, it's close to the Zoo, and it's super clean. -DJ

<Content>Clean, friendly hotel We stayed in this hotel over the Easter holidays and had a good time there. Breakfast was excellent with plenty to choose from. Room was clean and cleaned daily with sheets changed mid stay. Staff were very friendly; housekeeping, reception, dining room - everyone. Reception recommended an Italian restaurant nearby (La Latina) which was excellent and very reasonably priced.

<Content>Super Hotel Great hotel beside the Zoo. Ideal position for the underground and getting around. We stayed in room 16 which has a balcony overlooking the street. We had a large room with a sofa and chair. No air conditioning which would cause discomfort in the summer. The hotel is very clean with great beds.The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help. Super breakfast every morning. We hired bikes from Fat Tire company around the corner. 12 euros for the day. Well worth the money got out to the Berlin forest which has nature trails and lakes. Watch out for the nudist lake. Go onto the larger lake it looks over to Spandu.The city is made for cycling with lanes for the bike on the pavement. Would certainly go back to this hotel.

<Content>Accomodating staff, good location The hotel astoria is located about 200 metersfrom the Zoogarden Bahnhoff - the main trainstation in west berlin though most trains won't connectdirectly to here - it will take short 5 minute s-bahn ridefrom the main train station - hauptbanhoff in central berlinthat was just completed in july 2006.The hotel staff were very accomodating, roomswere normal sized with a relatively large bathroom.No air conditioning which would make this less ideal choicein the heat of the summer - we were in berlin when tempssoared to 38C making this quite unbearable - openingthe windows was not helpful since we faced the courtyardotherwise you would face a busy street which was notany better. Mosquitoes were a problem on both nightswe were bit about 3-4 times during the night since theydid not have screens (window) on the windows. no fansas well.Recommend staying in non-summer and it'd be a greathotel with an accomodating staff. The lobby has freeinternet access as well. In the heat of the summer, itwas miserable and for the price you pay it's a bit disappointingthat at nearly 100+ euros you can't get any a/c. would recommend a higher level hotel or a larger chain.

<Content>Very Accomodating My husband and I stayed at Hotel Astoria for a few days while on vacation in Berlin last August. We found the staff to be very accomodating, informative and friendly. The hotel is also in convenient walking distance to the bus station and many shops. We truly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel.
