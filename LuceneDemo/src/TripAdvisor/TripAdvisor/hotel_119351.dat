<Content>Great stay for family We went to visit relatives for Thanksgiving. We had a 2 bedroom suite for our family of 2 adults, 3 kids (8,9,11). the room was clean, nicely furnished, quiet, comfortable. Kids were sold as soon as they saw a plasma TV right in their own room. Don't know if it's some low water deal or not, but the toilets clogged two times a day which is a pain with kids that don't notice such things. the pool was heated and we used that every day as well as the basketball court immediately adjacent. What ever they call their evening event, it's not a happy hour, so that was a little disappointing. But the kids loved the snacks. Breakfast was o.k. some egg dish and breakfast meat in buffet style along with toast, muffins, cereal, fruit, juices.

<Content>Big bugs a problem Three of us stayed at the Homewood Suites Biltmore for six nights at the end of April. The breakfast buffet and use of the computer with free internet access was very nice. The staff was very helpful. The location was good for us, and close to shopping and many chain restaurants. The problem was the three big bugs we had in the room. One night there was a dead one on the floor near the beds; another day there was a live one running around on the ceiling; and another day there was an almost dead one on its back near the door.These were not small bugs either -- I would say they were 2 inches in length. The front desk person called them water bugs. Whatever they are, they are gross, and I would not stay there again without assurance that the bugs were gone.

<Content>Quite acceptable We arrived at the hotel - by taxi - at 1:00 AM. The clerk was friendly, accommodating and informational. She was able to change our room at the last minute to give us a King (which was not available when we booked). The room itself was adequate, if nothing special. It was on the first floor, but not noisy, nor did it give the impression of being unsafe. Within walking distance are a Trader Joes, a Fry's supermarket, a Mervyn's and a host of other stores (so I can only surmise that when the other reviewer said that it is not pedestrian friendly that he or she would be unable to walk two blocks).The next morning, the hotel's shuttle took me to the rental car place a half mile or so down the street (Tip: when in Phoenix, never, NEVER rent a car at the airport, the fees are insane. Instead, book your rental at one of the Hertz or Enterprise locations in town, then return your car to the airport; you don't pay the airport taxes that way. Even better, if you can swing it, cab both ways to your hotel, and rent just while in town ... if you are there for any length of time, you will definitely save your cab fare, and will have less hassle than waiting for the stupid rental car shuttle at Sky Harbor). Back to the hotel: the breakfast was only fair, but edible. However, overall, we found the place pleasant and would return. Generally, our trips to Phoenix are not in the winter, and we found this place to have quite favorable rates for this time of year.

<Content>Clean and quiet room. This was my first time at a Homewood Suites and I was happy. I found it nicer/cleaner than some of the Residence Inns I've stayed at. The bed was comfy, lots of soft pillows, a huge room service menue, and no problems with the internet service. I was upgrade to a 2 room suite based on being a Hilton VIP member, which was a nice surprise.

<Content>Just adequate for a long stay I stayed here with my husband and two small children for a long stay- almost a month. The room was clean but smelled a little funny at first, almost like particleboard or something. It had been recently renovated so that might explain it but it did bother me almost the whole time.The staff were attentive and nice, the laundry facilities weren't the best (the dryers didn't work well), the gym had a couple of treadmills and a weight bench, and the breakfast was decent, although lacking in vegetarian choices.The pool was nice and clean, and the dining area for breakfast was also comfortable and clean.There is no park within walking distance for little children, which was disappointing. Also, the hotel is located on a main intersection that wasn't very pedestrian friendly. Even though there was shopping across the street it seemed safer to drive there! This hotel would be nice for a shorter stay, especially for those without little children.

<Content>Great Place!!! Nice size rooms. Great price thanks to Best Rates Guarantee. Room was clean. Breakfast was very good. Stayed on a Friday so can't speak about the manager's recepetion. Very good location. Bed was not the most comfortable. Also hotel does not stock conditioner just shampoo. Would stay again.

<Content>Bad Room at Beat Homewood I have staying in Hilton Hotels for business travel and vacations consistently over the years. As a Gold HiltonHHonors Member, I found this hotel to not be up to the standards of the Hilton brand. The room provided was in very bad condition. The room was not clean, smelled of smoke (altough I requested a non-smoking room), the furniture was beat (graffiti), and, to top it all off, I found a dead roach in the room. I guess it also found the room to be unacceptable, especially to those who paid $150.00 per night!
