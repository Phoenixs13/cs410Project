<Content>Great Hotel, but a little noise My husband and I have stayed at this hotel twice - once on our honeymoon, and once as a romantic weekend on the way to Paris. The location is absolutely perfect - a five minute walk from the train station (no need to get a cab, even if you are dragging luggage); close enough to the red light district for hanging out, but far enough away not to be bothered by the noise. Great restaurants and shops are within very easy walking distance. The biggest downside is the church next door - the bells ring every 15 minutes, day or night. It didn't bother me at all, but my husband commented on it. The rooms were clean both times we stayed; not luxurious but very good. The included breakfast has a nice selection to choose from - much more than a continental breakfast includes in the States. I will definitely stay again the next time I make it to Amsterdam!

<Content>Just as expected! Previous reviews seem fair - it's not a luxury hotel by any means, but you wouldn't be expecting that surely considering the price. (prices seem generally high for hotels here, or am I rubbish at bargain hunting?)Our room smelt a little musty, but was a good size and had large windows which you could open wide to get fresh air (wouldn't want to have a child in the room, as could fall out of the window easily). Location fantastic IF you are not averse to sex shops, prostitues, drug taking nearby or extreme drunkeness. If you are, then stay in some other part of Amsterdam. There are so many beautiful areas. I am not really fussed by any of those things, so location suited me and my husband just fine! Nothing alse significant to note about this hotel.

<Content>Location / location Stayed for two nights. Three females for a 40th birthday.Had reservations after reading reviews.The location was excellent, beside the Grasshopper..Only heard the 'Bells' on an afternoon nap after a late night.Room was very large, with large windows overlooking side street.Very clean and suited requirements for two days. Breakfast was extra 鈧?2.50 all you can eat, not bad.Hotel was very quiet, in fact only saw a flow of people at breakfast time.Well worth the money.

<Content>Mixed feelings Stayed her for two nights July 18th -20th 2008. As other reviewers have noted, we were charged an extra 25 Euros on checkout for breakfast even though it was included in our booking. I was in a part yof 20 and ours was the only room that was charged this. All rooms were booked at the same time.If hotel staff read these reviews, can I have my money back ? Our double room (320) was fairly small, two single beds pushed up against each other. Bathroom large and clean but shower inefficient to the point of being virtually useless. Shower curtain rail bowing in the middle and held together with black tape. This hotel is in an excellent central location, very close to Dam Square, the Red light district and the railway station. Downsid e to this of course, as with any city centre hotel, is noise, particularly the bells as others have noted. On the plus side, my companions and I managed to drink so much that this was never a problem for us. Breakfast excellent, but breakfast room extremely hot, to the point of being uncomfortable. If i get some money back from them I would use this place again. Otherwise, no.

<Content>looking for a place to sleep? good place to kip but thats about it. were told we didn't order a double room or breakfast even tho we definitely did.ended up with an attic room that was small but nicely decorated. was a bit hard to find when they switched the lights off at night but atleast we got peace. the bells were right next to our window but didn't bother us that much.they must take reviews into consideration as ear plugs are now supplied in rooms!the biggest downfall was that the room was so narrow we couldn't push the beds together. watch out for hidden taxes.as a repeat visitor to amsterdam i was already aware of these but first timers should be told about a 5% tax on your final bill and hotel fees to print your bill.you can't fault the location of the hotel.if all your looking for is a place to crash then this place is for you.

<Content>More than I expected Had an extremely good experience at Hotel terminus. Booked triple room (one queen one single bed). Great size room 219 with large double window and a table and three chairs, overlooking the courtyard. Had no problem with the bells we rather enjoyed them (maybe the smoke in the air?). No face cloths. Narrow spiral staircase (pretty cool). Couldn't hear the neighbours. Location, location, location, 50 feet from redlight district. 10 min walk to centraal stn. Good staff quite helpful. If you are there to enjoy red light and cafes I didn't see a better place. Electronic room keys. Will definitely be staying at Terminus on our next trip!

<Content>Great location, huge room, clean, great for price We seem to have a totally different experience to the last review! Greeted by a helpful staff member, no problems checking in. Room was huge with high ceilings! I think the largest room I have ever had in Europe. Clean and tidy and really nice bathroom. Location was perfect, no noise and no bells that I could here. Lift worked great and I found the stairs large...Only issue, room did smell a little smokey...but for the price and location it was a perfect hotel for our 2 night visit.

<Content>Hotel Terminus...More like Hotel Terrible!! Hotel Terminus...More like Hotel Terrible!! Myself and my boyfriend arrived at reception and we were greeted by one of the rudest people I have ever met! We handed over our print out from the booking agent and the receptionist informed me that we would not be getting breakfast - I stated that breakfast was indeed included in my price, he told me it wasn't and therefore didn't bother to tell me where the breakfast room was..Went up to our room and it was smelly, small and grubby! Certainly wouldn't have classed it as a 3 star hotel.. I don't know who wrote in a previous review that they never heard bells ring - the bells rang EVERY bloomin' other hour and sleep was something that was difficult to get! Yes - I would agree that Hotel Terrible is in a good location - minutes away from everything... However if you want a good nights sleep in order to enjoy the sights and scenary - well then this hotel is NOT for you! After a day - the lift broke!! And we spent the next two days walking up and down 3 flights of narrow stairs...Nightmare when carrying suitcases...Finally came to checking out - this was indeed another experience... I was informed that they charged a 'City Tax' on top of the price that I had already paid. So I had to hand over extra money that I was unaware about...THIS IS THE BEST PART - The receptionist then tells me that they charge a 鈧?.00 administration fee.... So I need to pay 鈧?.00 for her to print out my bill.... How ridiculous... I know it is only a euro - but it's the fact that they add these ridiculous fees!So the best part of my hotel experience was pushing the doors open and leaving with my suitcase! I couldn't wait to get back on the plane, get home and have a decent shower....But again... like I say - if you tend to be up all night partying and don't need much sleep - you'll hardly notice the annoyances that I had...

<Content>Great hotel but those damn bells....... Got a great deal as I booked months in advance. Really friendly reception staff. Very clean hotel and the room was pretty good, lovely linen on beds etc. Beware the bells. They rang every 30 mins from 6 am and it would drive you to dementia. Bring earplugs.

<Content>Clean but a little noisy Stayed in the Hotel Terminus. It was a nice room however it was quite noisy. The church bells rang quite often during the night (every 7 minutes or so) and it was otherwise quite noisy as the voices from the street easily penetrated the windows.All the amenities were quite nice and the hotel does have Wi-fi (although you do have to pay 12 Euros to use it for the day). Conveniently located about 5 minutes from Centraal station and just around the corner from the red light district.An oddity I found with the room (and this may be quite common in Europe) was that the bed was made up with a fitted sheet and a bedspread that covered the top of the bed (and didn't go down the sides. This meant that when there were 2 of you in bed that you had to sleep quite close to each other otherwise you wouldn't be covered by the bedspread...

<Content>Great Location/Clean Hotel Terminus - AmsterdanApril, 2008Trip Advisor Member - Phoenix, ArizonaStayed at the Hotel Terminus and it has a great location and is a clean hotel (bring washcloths they do not have them). We took the train from the airport - about 20 minutes and you get off at Centraal Station which is a 10 minute walk from the Terminus (an easy walk). The breakfast is very nice and not only coldcuts they have scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage along with fruit, ceral and assorted pastries. We had several tours booked with Lindburgh Tours and the tour office where the buses leave from was a 3 minute walk from the Terminus (Damrik St. I think) and it was so easy to get to. The hotel is one block from the famous Red Light District so it was easy to walk through. The only drawback to the hotel was the checkin time. We arrived at 9AM and could not checkin until 3PM but they did have a luggage room to store bags. The hotel was full so maybe if it's not they will let you checkin early does not hurt to ask. Nice clean bathroom with tub and shower and plenty of hot water. Would recommend a stay here.

<Content>Great location! The Hotel Terminus was right in the heart of the action in Amsterdam, just a hop, skip, and a jump to the Red Light District, and the coffeshops. Our group had 3 rooms, they were all clean, no problems. I read so many reviews before we went that said the church bells were loud and bothersome--none of us ever heard the bells, and I am a very light sleeper. It was, however, somewhat noisy due to the volume of people walking along the square below our room, at all hours. The rest of our party had rooms that did not face the square, so they were quieter. The hotel definitely has very weird stairs, long and winding, many narrow--that was the only negative, as once we got off the elevator there was still a long walk to our room up these stairs. The 6 of us are all in our late 20s/early 30s and we would happily return to the Hotel Terminus. I wouldn't stay there with kids, too close to the fun.

<Content>Great Location to stumble back to!! I have been to Amsteradm 4 times and this hotel was the by far the best location and value for money over the others I have stayed in.It is only a 5 minute walk from central station which is very handy when its chucking it down with rain as it often does in Amsterdam!!We booked a business room which was very large for amsterdam standards. This included an in room safe, minibar and even BBC1 and 2 on the TV although we didnt stay in to watch TV. Bathroom was brand new and the room was very clean.I found the reception staff to be very helpful and polite. No problem if you need to leave your luggage either,Would stay here again if I come back to Amsterdam, overall very impressed.

<Content>good location it's all u get If you want to stay in this hotel you should know that they have a late check in at 15:00 which may be inconvienient if you arrive early in the morning. The girls at the reception desk are not very polite and if you have any problem you should talk to one of the guys. This hotel is definetly not a 3 star but more like a 2star, because the rooms doesn't have anything special.

<Content>I Amsterdam-Great Experience The hotel is situated near all the main attractions of Amsterdam and the Central Station. We have booked 6 double rooms. All of them were very spacious and cleaning was satisfactory. One of our rooms was on the 1st floor, facing the street of the back side of the hotel. As a result it was noisy throughout the day and sometimes even dangerous from passers- by, being drunk. Breakfast was very good and the staff was most of them helpful and friendly. In conclusion Terminus is a good choice, specially in terms of value for money. I will be visiting Amsterdam again, it was a great experience.... with no kids and definitely no KLM the worse airline company. stelios-Katerina Greece

<Content>Excellent! Having stayed at more expensive hotels, and being a bit of a hotel snob, I booked two nights at the terminus with some trepidation. However, my fears were unfounded. The hotel was clean, the staff were very helpful, and the location was fantastic. 10 minute walk from Centraal Station, and a stones throw from the red light district with its bars, the location couldn't be better. Whilst its certainly not the best hotel I've stayed in in Amsterdam, its quality for the price cannot be argued against. Ideal for young couples and singles, I highly recommend the Hotel Terminus.

<Content>Never again.... Having stayed at the Swissotel (Damrak) for two nights on several previous weekend stays in Amsterdam with my girlfriend, we decided to stay 3 nights this time for the same cost. Therefore, we shopped about and following the reviews on the usually highly trustworthy Tripadvisor...we booked into the Terminus through Expedia.The location was fine as it was central as we needed. However, the first room we were given was street level opposite the Stones Cafe...if my other half had stood in the window with the lights on she'd have had offers for sex such was the poor privacy it offered. The lighting was woeful, the 3 single beds were dirty and the room reminded me of a stag weekend special rate offer!We complained .To the hotels' credit, they moved us to the 2nd floor and a real double as we had booked. However, it was still a real drop down in class from the Swissotel...yes, I know you get what you pay for...but the difference of 拢20 per night would have been worth every penny.This hotel is worn out, creaking, out of date and ideal for drunk stag parties who won't be able to see the detail due to them being stoned or drunk!!!!If you are a couple looking for something a little better....do your self a favour....look up the road at the hotel with a swiss sounding name!!!!

<Content>The Terminus is great, but we knew that already! Yet another fantastic trip to Amsterdam. This our 9th or 10th visit and we have stayed at the Terminus all but once (first time we drove and stayed at Schipol, never again!)The hotel is perfectly situated if you want to be in the thick of the red light district, it is also only minutes from Dam square and the lovely shopping streets.We have stayed in many rooms but this one was perfect, overlooking the red light district with a perfect view of the church clock, what a wonderful sight to open your eyes to. And for all those who complain about the chimes..I think you may be visiting the wrong city!The hotel, as always, was clean, safe, friendly and very accomodating. Beautifully quirky with the narrow steps and interestingly shaped rooms. Definately worthy of it's 3 stars. We are already planning our next trip to 'The Dam' and we will most certainly be staying at the Terminus. Caroline  Simon

<Content>Reasonable rates, good service  Hotel Terminus is situated very near the train station, just before you reah the RLD. I have stayed here near on 10 times now, and stayed in several different rooms! The rooms are averaged sized, with all expected amenities (Shower, Toilet, TV, etc). Some have air conditioning, but those that don't, do have openable windows!All the staff at this hotel are very helpful and help make your stay pleasant.The price for rooms are very reasonable and within most peoples budgets!I would definitely recommend this place to my friends, family and anyone who ask for a hotel of this type.

<Content>Five star quality As I was travelling with friends and we were in amsterdam for the same reason as every other group of young adults...to see the famous red light district and venture into a smoking friendly cafe location of our hotel was extremely important..The terminus hotel is located right on the edge of the red light district in amesterdam, its location is excellent! Not in the red light district so you are away from the scummy people at night..There is a phone and internet cafe 2 doors down, so it makes it very conveinant to keep in touch with family and friends, the grass hopper restaurant is at the end of the street and the food is superb!The foyer of this hotel is very modern and stylish, front desk are very helpful and friendly!The down side to this hotel is to get to our room we had to go up and down several flights of stairs once we had gotten to our floor! it sounds odd but it was like a maze!!Our room was very modern and cosy, the bathroom was well fitted out and the shower was large and clean.The television had a good choice of channels, including several english movie channels and news channels!Breakfast was amazing, there was a large spread of hot and cold dishes which were all yum!

<Content>Good Hotel, Centrally Located and Decent Price! We stopped at the Hotel Terminus on 18th July 2007. We had read the reviews on this site and at first were a little apprehensive about the 'bells' from the church opposite waking us up. We ended up in a room opposite the church and did not hear them once during the night! This hotel is really close to everything. At the end of the street is where the canal boat tours start (highly recommended) and just around the corner from the red light district. We felt totally safe at the hotel and were not put off at all by the red light district. The staff were friendly and polite. We were put in room 104 which I could definately recommend. The room was spacious and clean with a decent sized bathroom. We had a sitting area in the room which we were pretty pleased with! Whilst the bells didn't bother us we did hear a few rowdy groups late at night but it was over with pretty quickly and it wasn't something I would complain about. Breakfast was pretty typical European fare and very tasty! Check out the Chandeliers in the breakfast room (If my house was big enough I'd fancy one in my living room!) I'd recommend this for most types of people, the stairs are pretty tight (as with most places in Holland!) but there is a lift for people with problems with stairs.

<Content>Convenient location Just returned from 2 nights here after my brother's stag do. There were 8 of us altogether and we all thought the hotel was worth the money we paid, if for no other reason its convenient for the Red Light District.All the rooms were clean and tidy with TV, new bathrooms, and A/C which was a big bonus.The bells were louder in some rooms than others, could hardly hear them in mine!Breakfast was usual continental style but more than adequate.All in all it was a good option for a weekend in the Dam, although probably not ideal for a stag party (we were very nearly thrown out on the second night!).

<Content>Too much noise! Excellent location close to the central train station. Near the red light district. On the other side of the street was a pub and the noise in night was terrible! Friendly staff. Excellent breakfast and service. Ask to have room upstairs and in the front side of the building!

<Content>Central Location We stayed at the Hotel Terminus over the Easter weekend and the hotel and location was very good. Yes, you are close to the red light district, but just turn left out of the hotel instead of right and you will miss it all. We had booked a superior room through a website and that worked out really well. However I knew beforehand and it can be a problem but there is a cultural centre right opposite the hotel were the bells/carillion go every quarter of an hour. The hotel do supply ear plugs so they recognise the problem and I do urge you to wear them as it can be a problem., especially if the weather was very hot and you need to open windows.Don't miss the Anne Frank house or the Van Gogh Museum, but do get there before opening as the queues build up really quickly and can take forever to get in. Also use the trams to get around as they are really efficient and cheap 1.60 euros per person and that takes you to lots of different areas within the city.Whatever you do take a look at the red light district if only for a laugh. Oh and don't be afraid of the so-called coffee shops that are really selling drugs. They are easily recognisable so you won't make an accidental mistake. ENJOY !

<Content>excellent location This hotel is ideally located to all of amsterdam's tourist attractions, including the red light district, coffee shops and most major museums. The service is above average with daily maid service and changing of towels etc. Unsuitable for families with children, in my opinion, due to the hotel being adjacent to the red light district. Staff are very friendly and helpful. the only reason I have not given this hotel an excellent rating is because of the noise of the bells, while it is not overwhelmingly loud they can be heard early in the morning. Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again if and when I return to Amsterdam.

<Content>Nice hotel, fantastic location! My two friends and I recently stayed in a triple room in the Hotel Terminus and had a great time. It is literally a five-minute walk from Central Station, although we got lost on the way because the size of the streets on the maps can be deceiving compared to reality! Beware - the streets really are tiny!!!The staff in the hotel were very friendly and always willing to give advice to where to go, what to do and how to do it. They were very helpful at times. The room however was quite small for three people. It is simply a double room with an extra bed squeezed in, but it was everything we needed for our stay so we were happy enough. Lovely bathroom too.The location of the hotel is probably it's best factor. It is located on a very quiet street but 10 seconds away, around the corner you encounter an endless amount of shops, bars, coffeeshops and a really buzzing atmosphere. It's great! Dam Square and great shopping is literally 5 minutes away, if even. The Hotel is also right beside a police station as well so security is very good. I was worried about the bells when I read previous reviews but we really didn't take any notice of them. The tune they play is almost theraputic (when you do hear it) and after all, if you don't want to hear traditional church bells then maybe you have planned a trip to the wrong city!! Overall the hotel is a great place to stay if you want somewhere that is centrally located.

<Content>Those bells!! The hotel is situated just right for Centraal Station, the shops and the red light district. Unfortunately it is also very close to those bells!! Our room was very warm, wonderful for September, not so good for us, as there was no air conditioning and to have the windows open meant hearing the constant ringing. Not the best two nights sleep we've ever had! Room was clean although small but okay for a short stay. We would consider the Terminus again, especially if we could resolve the air con  noise problem.

<Content>The Bells, The Bells Stayed here in November. The Triple Room was the best that we encountered in our 11 trips to Amsterdam. Honestly, the room is absolutley fine, although there is no safe. The staff were friendly, much friendlier than your average Dutchman in the service industry, and it was clean. However, this is all completely offset by the bells. Even with ear plugs sleeping after 6am was almost impossible, they go off every 15 minutes and believe me, they are loud and will wake you up. Do not kid yourself that an ensemble of church bells less than 70 metres away will be tolerable. All in, even though the hotels facilities, room standard and location are more than good, it's all ruined by the bells.

<Content>Beware of bells!! Me and my two friends stayed in a triple room, which I must say was lovely. It was a great size for us three girls and the bathroom etc was very clean. The only downside to this place was the local clock that actually rang out its bells every 15 and 30mins. It also bell rings on the hour every hour 24 7. Me and the girls basically never got any sleep the whole weekend. After checking out of the hotel I needed to know how the hell something can be allowed. It turns out that it is for the local prostitutes! They are not allowed clocks as this is known as clock watching, so the bells ring out and they know the time etc... Crazy. All in all though a lovely place, just such a shame this spoilt the hotel as well as the adjacent buildings, hotels around.

<Content>Very Convienient Booked the Terminus for its location, and wasn't let down. Only a few 100 yards from Central station, and on a quieter street just away from the Red light area. We had been considering getting a cab from the station with my elder dad and the suitcases, but it was very much easier and quicker to walk. The front of the hotel opens on to a completly normal street, with Dam Sqare, and the main shopping streets not far away, and the main redlight area with its cafes just round the corner but not obtrusive. It was very handy for the Beurse Belage which was hosting a good (Bokbier) festival at the time.We wern't expecting much from a 3 star this near to the station but the hotel exceeded our expectations. We had a room at the front on only the first floor, but apart from the occasional noisy passer by, there were no reportable disturbances. The room size was adequate, although one of the smaller rooms according to the fire plan.Hotel service was good, and they satisfied our requests for a double and single close to each other. Good safe in the wardrobe. Breakfast was good, but quite expensive.Security was good with key cards, and automatically with one per person.Would definatly consider for my next trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Good points and bad points Bit of a mixed one this. The hotel was in a great location and the rooms were clean and bathrooms excellent. They allowed storage of luggage before and after check-in and -out. The staff were for the most part very good. That's the good points - here are the bad... the rooms were strange - our's had a low sloping ceiling which meant I had to walk with a stoop if I didn't want to smack my head on it. My friends room had a dangerously steep staircase/ladder up to a second level where the bed was. The (none-smoking) room stunk of cigarette smoke, as did the corridors, although they also smelled of urine. The room was wrong - we were given a twin instead of a double. They changed the room and the man on the desk sent us the wrong way to get to the new one and then when we came back lost refused to take us to the other room and was extremely rude to us. When we found the new room it was still a twin but with the beds pushed together. Beware the location too - near the station means near the great big clock (opposite) which chimes every 15 minutes and can keep you awake. Also, if you're on the ground floor, forget about sleeping as the traffic and people outside are noisy at all hours. All in all, I wouldn't return. Very, very overpriced for what you get.

<Content>Clean and very comfortable! My boyfriend and I stayed in the hotel terminus for 4 nights. I was'nt expecting anything great from the hotel because it was so cheap but I was very surprised. The staff were friendly and very helpful. We stayed in a double room which was big,clean and very comfortable. There was 1 double bed, a single bed, a television and an en-suite bathroom with a shower/bath. The hotel was very central and we were only a 5 min walk from Dam square.The only bad thing about the hotel was the noise from the church bells(which we got used to after a while) and our noisy neighbours but at least they got us up in the mornings. I would highly recommend this hotel because compared to other Amsterdam hotels it's paradise.

<Content>good value and great location hotel is ideally suited to all main parts of Amsterdam and is also excellent value for money , staff are helpful and friendly and hotel is suitable for small groups and couples alike. Only downside would be the church bells that seem to go on all morning but at least it gets you out of bed from the night before. All in all would definetely use this hotel again.

<Content>Comfortable Stay After reading the past listings here, I had great concerns about booking Hotel Terminus. We brought ear plugs for the church bells, though we did not have to use them. We took other precautions to protect valuables, etc., however a secured locked door separates the lobby from the rooms, your electronic room key card opens the door. The Hotel provides a free in room safe for your use, and you set your personal combination. Our stay in triple room 218 was near perfect. Two double beds are side by side, and a sofa bed (not very comfortable) are in the room. The only negative issue was no housekeeping service the second day, upon reporting this to the front desk; they acknowledged that a few of the rooms had not been cared for that day; they apologized, and brought clean towels to our room right away. The room was large enough for us not to get in each others way, and the bathroom was also a good size, with bathtub and shower combination. The room when we arrived was very clean, all 3 of us was very pleasantly surprised about the whole experience. The staff spoke very good English, and was very friendly, and honest. We would stay here again.

<Content>good,clean  I booked before I read the negative reviews  was a bit concerned but I was very pleasantly surprised.This hotel is so much better than some of the others I've stayed in in Amsterdam. I had a superior room which,although wasn't massive it was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was the same. I found the staff very helpful and pleasant and the bar/lounge/lobby area was great for relaxing with a drink.If you want a hotel that is right in the middle of all the fun of Amsterdam,convenient for Central station  is safe and comfortable without breaking the bank then the hotel Terminus is for you :)

<Content>I liked it! The Terminus hotelThe location of the hotel is great (60 seconds by foot from the Dam square). It is not far from the red light district, yet it feels safe to hang around since there is a police station right around the corner.The hotel is very nice, and clean. As far as service and facilities; I have only compliments: the staff is very friendly and helping, the rooms are small and clean (though I can't promise you will have any special view from the windows); the bathrooms are clean also and surprisingly bigger then the entire room itself. You will be asked to give 100 euro as a deposit or alternatively to give your international visa number. Bottom line: I liked it!

<Content>Terminus is top! Just had a very enjoyable weekend staying in Hotel Terminus. Was in a triple room (219) which had lots of space and was very warm. Slight downside as it was for three blokes and there was one single bed (I got that one!) and a double. So you may want to specify single beds if you need a triple room!Didn't notice the bells that much, though I was wearing earplugs as not to hear the snoring that was going on elsewhere in the room. And as noted elsewhere, watch the step up to the bathroom!Staff were nice and friendly and spoke perfect English. The breakfast room is a bit on the small side, so you may want to try and get there before everyone else. You may also want to check out before everyone else as it can get a bit cramped in the lobby and they can only really get 2 people behind the desk.This hotel is light-years better than other places I've stayed in Amsterdam and is 5 mins walk from the train station and Dam square. It's also right round the corner from the red light district and its various trappings.

<Content>What are they on about? Booked the Hotel before reading trip advisor and read some damming reports. Felt rather concerned as I was travelling with my wife and 5 kids. Booked 2 - 4 bed rooms. One on the ground floor and one on the first floor. First floor is non-smoking however there was a slight taint of smoke in our room but by no means bad. Rooms very clean and beds made every day. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast good and plenty of it.Noise - of course there is noise - this is a bustling City - what do you expect! If you want to get away from noise - go to the lake district!! The bells and music and the odd drunk making their way home is part of city life. Very close to the Red Light District - but a real experience for my teenage boys. Its not sleezy unless you want it to be. Great shopping - but for a bit of advice - take your wife's credit card away! Kids loved it - ages 7, 10, 14, 15, 16. they all now know what a prostitue looks like and the smell of marijuana eminating from the Coffee Shops throughout the city.This is not the Ritz, nor is it Ritz prices. With a big family this is great value for money and would go again.

<Content>Fantastic location Read your reviews after booking the Terminus and were a little concerned. The location was fab and hardly walked anywere as biked it or went on the trams. Although the room was small the hotel was clean and the staff very freindly and helpful. The lounge area was comfortable and the breakfast great. We stayed in room 102, not to be advised as yes you could hear the church bells. I still feel we got value for money and would return to the Terminus if guaranteed a large quiet room.

<Content>Great location, bring your earplugs This hotel has a great location if your keen to see the central city and red light district while being close to the train station. Staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast included was comprehensive. Room was a little small considering the price and the nearby town clock chimed all night. Would recommend this hotel but earplugs are a must if you're sensitive to street/city noises, to be expected in this part of town.

<Content>what a disaster Stayed atTerminus for 4 nights. First night did not sleep until 5am for the noise from the street and the church bells. Second night returned to bedroom at midnight to find room door smashed in and all belongings gone. Fortunately the thief who had broken into four bedrooms was apprehended. Asked to see manager as thief had managed to enter locked doors of hotel, go past reception and through locked doors to bedroom passage. Never did see Manager. Saw Asst. Manager at end of stay who just said that these things happen. The stay was a complete disaster.

<Content>Oh My God Don't stay here. location is good, right next to Damn square and the clock tower that chimes every hour, one chime for each hour. Midnight is a real treat.Had dirty towels that had hair on them. Called reception to be told i had to go down there (4 flights of stairs, no lift) to get clean ones.Shower has no curtain in ugly bathroom so don't keep anything in there you don't want getting wet. Bill Bryson in his book Neither Here Nor There gave a similar review. Unfortunatley I read it after I had stayed there.Very ugly and depressing hotel.

<Content>Excellent Location My girlfriend and i and 2 friends stayed at the hotel Terminus which is idealy situated and 2min away from Dam Square, Red Light district and 5mins from central station. The hotel is basic and clean and has everything you would want for a weekend break in amsterdam. We were upgraded on arrival from a Standard room which was good. The breakfast was typical contenental but done the job. We were in room 311 which was a good size. Watch out for the random step between the bedroom and bathroom! The people behind the reception where very helpfull in directing us to places, and spoke good english. In terms of things to do I would definately recommened the heineken experience, 10euros entrance fee which includes 3free drinks! Me and my mates girlfriends seemed to enjoy the redlight district more than we did, which was worrying!

<Content>Terminus Hotel, centrum. Whilst in amsterdam, i pre booked at the terminus hotel, from Australia. Not knowing what to except, 3 stars, however 3 stars in Amsterdam, is considered by european standards well above average, eqall to 5 stars in Aus. This i soon realized, our money, once your there, is worth plenty. Clothes Italian, french, Rolex, etc, buy there and your laughing. also the Red Light Area, is only 1 street away. Nightclubs, rave, coffe shops, 585 all up. RE; have a good time, keep energy levels up as people have a peroid of falling foul of exaustion, due to climate, etc. I totally reccomend this Hotel, staff courteus, English speaking ,multi-lingual. cable,tel, heating, pretty much all you will need to enjoy your stay.

<Content>A bit Pants The place is a disgrace!! Stayed there in Feb 2005 and it was the worst hotel ever.The room was very small and had the most uncomfortable beds ever, like sleeping on a bag of stones. There was a nasy smell all around the hotel (Smelt a lot like a KenRay). There was a very seedy gentleman named Richard Fitch loitering around the lobby and reception all the time. He was constantly waving a handfull of Euros at all the guests demanding a good time (apparently he's there most days).I recommend checking out and sleeping on the streets by the canal instead.

<Content>2nd stay at the Terminus Hotel Great location, clean rooms, friendly staff. I think the negative reviews on this site must be from people who stayed in the cheaper rooms. It's worth spending a few extra euros on the rooms with full bathroom which we did this week for our second stay at the Terminus. We don't bother with the hotel breakfast included in the price as it's just standard continental. The church bells didn't bother us at all and the room was nice and warm (room 214). This is now our 'Amsterdam' hotel of choice, primarily for it's location, but everything else about the hotel has always been fine for us. Of course there are better hotels in Amsterdam, but you'll pay more for them.

<Content>Middle of everything For a short break this was the ideal location. ok the room was small and the corridoor was like a rabbit warren, but how long will you spend there ? The Red Light district was very close but you could always go across to Dam Square and the shops/bars there. As for the Church bells I didn't notice them after a while and after a long day you just crashed out night. I would definately use this place again

<Content>Never, Ever, Ever Never, ever, ever book a room at the Hotel Terminus or Hotel Teminal as we have called it! It is possibly the most disgusting hotel I and my friends have seen. Although we had booked knowing full well that it was in the heart of the Red Light District we did not expect it to be the seedy pit that it was. We had booked a superior triple room (spacious three bedded room was the description) no, no, no, small smelly small double bedded and single bedded flea pit more like it. Also a resembles a rabbit warren ( god knows what would happen if there was a fire). Do not be taken in by the lovely rooms on the website. The person who has seen these rooms in the Terminal must be suffering from delusions. We never even stayed for a night. Left and stayed at the Mercure at Amstel for only 20 euros more a night. Believe me, no comparison!!! You have been warned - the church bells are totally insignificant compared to the low, low standards of the rest of the Terminal. It does not even rate in my book as an any star hotel.

<Content>Would go back... Amsterdam is a lively city and the Hotel Terminus is just what you would expect from a city centre hotelOur party all had a great time and thought the hotel was excellent value for money. As for the bells - If you are looking for peace and quiet then don't stay in the centre of Amsterdam.The hotel is well situated, only a couple of minutes walk from Central Station and all the attractions within easy walking distance.O.K. so the breakfast room is quite small, though also quite adequate. We watched some of the guest making up their days meals from the adequate amount of food available at breakfast.We would all return to the Hotel Terminus when we next visit Amsterdam.No worries here.

<Content>Our Weekend in Amsterdam We had booked a double room for two nights at the Hotel Terminus. We would say that the Hotel was a typical 2/3 star Hotel and our room was relatively clean and quite comfortable. As far as we were concerned, the main problem with this Hotel was the NOISE!!!! If you think the sound of church bells is an enjoyable and relaxing sound - think again!! The chiming becomes extremely irritating after a while and you just can't switch off to it. Why don't they just chime on the hour?! Not only that, the noise from the streets (even at third floor level) is very, very loud until about 5am and then the road sweepers come out to play!! OK, we were in the centre of Amsterdam, but after three days and two nights with very little sleep, we were ready for a holiday!!! Breakfast time is hectic! The Breakfast Room is far too small and cramped for the number of people staying within the Hotel and the staff were not particularly helpful at all. Breakfast finishes at 10.30am and we were reminded of this fact at 10.25am when we were rather rudely asked to leave!! The door was even slammed behind us as we left!!All in all, we thought the Hotel Terminus was rather disappointing!!

<Content>Hotel Terminus Do not believe any bad reviews about this hotel. We read a number of reviews about this hotel after we booked and were very worried what we were going to end up going to.Reception area----- There is a small reception desk, which can get very busy at checking out time (11am), so remember to avoid it at this time. There are lots of leather chairs which are very comfortable. The staff are all friendly and very well dressed. We arrived at 10am, after a very early flight. As checking out was not until 11am our room was not ready until 3pm. We were giving a key for the luggage room to store our cases until we could check in.Rooms---- We had room number 216. The room and bathroom were modern and a good size with air conditioning. I do not understand the reviews that say this hotel is not 3star. We have stayed in hotels all over Europe and we would say this is a very good 3 star. The only 2 complaints we had about the room----- 1) The smell of cigarette smoke, as we are both non smokers. The hotel does have non smoking rooms which we did not realize until the last day. 2) Church bells!!!!!!!!!!!!!There are 2 churches, 1 at the back of the hotel and 1 at the front. The bells chime every 15 minutes from 7am -11pm, from 11pm- 7am they chime only on the hour.Breakfast------ There is a good size breakfast room, which can get very busy between 9-10am. There is a good selection.The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the train station and about 3 streets from the red light area. There was no noise(apart from the church bells), We found the street to be a quiet side street. If you can put up with the Church bells this is a very good 3 star hotel. We would recommend this hotel. Have fun in Amsterdam.

<Content>Hotel Terminus At Easter I stayed at the Terminus for the first time. Obviously this is a very busy time to go away!! We arrived at the hotel quite early (way before check in time) and I was expecting them to say you can leave your bag here, but you can't check into your room yet as is so common when arriving at a hotel. However I was very pleasantly surprised!! The receptionist said that because the hotel was so busy they had upgraded us to a superior suite at no extra cost. Well I couldn't believe it, that sort of thing never happens to me!! We went straight to our room and it was lovely. The bathroom was huge with a bath that had taps in the middle so you could squeeze two in! (not that I did of course!) It also had a separate shower cubicle and a marble sink with an automatic tap. The bedroom was a nice size with a massive bed, table and chairs, TV in a cabinet and a mini bar. It also had great big french doors which opened as windows facing the street. The location of the hotel is absolutely spot on if you want to be in the middle of the action, although is still quiet enough to get some kip at night! Terminus also offers breakfast as part of most deals which is a little chaotic and as I am not a morning person at the best of times I chose to have breakfast while out and about at my own leisure. The hotel staff are very friendly, helpful and always full of smiles, which I think is important. I have stayed in a fair few hotels in Amsterdam, but the Terminus scores by far the highest in my book!!

<Content>hotel termites ok so im an american. i suppose i expect more. the last 2 trip were in a 3-4 star hotels. the treminus is not on that same scale. 1 1/2 stars at best.staff was ok. nothing to write home about. the elevator was a comical ride. it was hard to find and once on, the thing stopped at my floor but i had to walk up 2 or 3 steps to get to my room. i admit that his was a budget trip but the room was so small that i had to take of my jacket in the hall. lolactually the shower was larger then the room it self. the bed was a single. it was lumpy and the radiator that provided heat was on the wall right behind my head. i burned my hand a couple of times on that stupid thing when i rolled over.the tv was mounted on the ceiling and could only be view from the bed. if there were more then 3 people in the room 1 of them was not gonna see the tv.all in all the hotel was not what i expected and wont stay or reccommend it to others. oh did i mention the bells from the church going off and the noise from the red light district was an all nighter.

<Content>Great Location....Shame About the Noise Stayed at the Terminus for 4 nights. Location of the hotel is really great as it's only a few minutes from Centraal Station, Dam Square, canal buses, trams, Red Light District etc. Even Leidesplein can be walked in a short time. However, do not expect to get much sleep at the Terminus, especially if you're at the back of the hotel. Our room overlooked several bars and it was noisy until at least 3am every night. Then just as you get settled the very tuneful bells of the Old Church wake you religiously at 7am!! Double or secondary glazing would have been greatly appreciated here.The hotel itself was ok...clean, tidy and warm, although I probably wouldn't rate it as 3*, as we were led to believe it is. It's more like 2*+. Breakfasts were what you'd expect in a European hotel, although they could probably do with having more croissants out as the plate emptied very quickly. Staff in the hotel were polite and friendly, even when I had to ask how to work the soft drinks machine in reception!Personally I wouldn't stay here again because of the noise, but if you're a party animal who doesn't want to sleep during the night then this would be perfect for you.

<Content>Too close to the Red Light District I booked the Hotel Terminus through the Delta booking service. I was told it was a 3 star hotel, centrally located, near the Ann Frank house - all of that was true. Shame on me for not looking up the location which was right in the Red Light District. My first impression of Amsterdam was of Dam square and the Red Light District. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and very helpful, but the hotel and our room, although clean, was shabby i.e. cigarette burns on the rugs, large cracks in the walls, dirty looking bedcovers. It was also noisy late into the evening with people running in the hallways. I think the Delta booking service was remiss in not telling me the close proximity to a very dangerous area - one that I did not find appealing. We paid with taxes and fees over $200 per night for a triple and I expected more.

<Content>Just came back from Terminus! Terminus is not a 5star hotel so we were not expecting one. It is a 3 star, and we thought it would be below average especially since it is a reasonably priced place to stay.I just returned back to London from a stay at Terminus on 18th June 2004. It is a fantastic hotel, staff are friendly, the reception is nice, the rooms are clean and simple. The view in our room was not great however the bathroom was very clean. The room service everyday providing new towels and cleaning the room was very efficient. It is CENTRAL amsterdam, near to everything. Everything is in walking distance, and the other hotels we saw that were close by to the centre seemed like poor quality hotels from the exterior. It is definately somewhere I would recommend you to stay. Food, Coffee Shops, Red Light District all within a very short walk. Enjoy!

<Content>Recommended Great central location (within fifty metres of 4 coffee shops), room was clean and well appointed and the hotel staff were always very freindly and helpful (gave out free tickets to the Holland Casino). However, breakfast was uninspired cold cuts, etc - but at least there was plenty.

<Content>stop terminating the Terminus I would recommend the Hotel Terminus to anyone looking for a very central, lively Hotel. The staff were hepful when we needed them and the rooms are well equiped.After staying at the Terminus, I thought it would be useful to post a review in response to all those that scared me!Hotel terminus is not a 5* Hotel BUT it is above average standard (this was my 3rd time in Amsterdam). It is a noisy hotel if you are at the front but if you are used to city living and enjoy being in the middle of things, it's not a problem. We paid a little extra for superior rooms and although 2 out of the 3 rooms in our party were excellent, 1 wasn't so grand.... but it was still clean and roomy.The hotel is VERY central; right next to the Red Light district, very close to Dam Square  the Palace and almost in sight from Centraal station. I am not saying that the bad reviews are inaccurate as I did not see the standard rooms but in my experience, the Hotel Terminus gave me peace of mind for our trip. enjoy.
