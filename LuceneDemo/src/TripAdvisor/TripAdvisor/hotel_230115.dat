<Content>Good price for a average hotel Needed a hotel due to a missed fly in the near of schiphol airport. Got a rate of EUR 99 with the Accor Favorite Guest Card. Hotel is a clean standard hotel with average rooms and free airport shuttle service (about 10-15 min.).Nothing for your holidays but for a short night - everytime again

<Content>Convenient - value for money We stopped here whilst attending a show at the RAI conference centre. We used the shuttle bus daily to get to and from Schipol where we caught a train to RAI (4 Euro return). Breakfast was included in the price of 69 Euro and was most adequate - Cereals, fruit, meats, cheese, breads, hot scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns - more than enough variety.The only reason we'd look for another hotel next time was that the shuttle buses last run from Schipol was at 11:45 which meant leaving the show before it ended - we got a taxi from the RAI one night that was 18 Euro - only 2 of us sharing would have obviouslly been more acceptable splitting it 4 ways.A very pleasant hotel and staff - recommend it.

<Content>Very convinient and comfortable hotel! I often stay at this Mercure and think its convinience and affordability make it great hotel for business travellers. The free shuttle from the airport that runs twice an hour is the best feature. You can easily take the shuttle to the airport and then take the train to downtown Amsterdam (or wherever). The rooms are nice and modern with large comfortable beds and nice bathrooms. The room service menu is very limited and I would definitely skip the 17 euro breakfast (it is only cold items!). I recommend getting your breakfast at the airport or at the McDonalds (or even the BP) across the street instead. The grocery store in the arrivals hall at the airport is great for picking up some things to keep in the room.This is a great hotel if you are in town for a quick stay and don't care about being right downtown. They also have special rates for a half day if you have a long layover (cheaper than the hotel in the airport itself).

<Content>Some funny bus trouble This is really quite a nice hotel, its lobby is reasonable. The restaurant / breakfast area was very nice with a great buffet breakfast.For paying 69 EUR for a twin room for 2 nights, we were very pleased. You can buy wireless access.The bar was very swish, although expensive. We did not eat at the hotel, but chose the McDonalds just across the street.Our problem came with the airport bus, which never materialised late one evening, after just missing a bus we waited half an hour - but that bus never arrived, so we waited an hour altogether for a bus. The driver had clearly just been having a break, said something in broken English about taxis fighting and we were delayed longer waiting for a hotel employee to arrive.

<Content>Great Hotel We spent 3 nights at the Mercure for 3 days in April and for 70 Eur per night with breakfast.Breakfast was fro cold to eggs and bacon buffey style and very good. The room was large and clean and the free shuttel to airport and back was great.A taxi was 18 Eur one way and we used shuttel to get to airport and t5hen took the train into Amsterdam each day. Also the held our luggage for 5 days as we did a side trip to Budapest for no charge.Would recomend this Hotel to anyone traveling to Holland and wanting to see Amsterdam

<Content>Great Hotel Do you want a clean, modern hotel room at a reasonable price? You found it! I have stayed in so many hotel rooms this year, and this was by far the nicest. Mine had a huge comfortable bed, a TV with lots of clear channels; a clean and modern bathroom; and very friendly staff. No complaints.

<Content>Too far away! This hotel reminds me of a Super 8 motel on an Interstate highway in America. It is in the middle of nowhere, with only a McDonalds nearby. To get into town, you need to take a shuttle to the airport, and then take a train downtown. Not recommended.
