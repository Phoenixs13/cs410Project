<Content>Great Value My partner and I stayed here in a basic double room for 3 nights and were very happy. The hotel is in a really nice area with great shopping and the Zoo close by. There are metro stations and buses everywhere so getting around was no problem at all. The room itself was not the biggest but it was modern, clean and quiet, although im sure the rooms facing the street would have had a bit more noise. The buffet breakfast was great, huge choice for all tastes, and for us was included in the price. The staff were nice enough and the hotel had internet and wifi avail to those with laptops. We stayed in October so the temperature was comfortable but be warned if staying in summer as there is no air con or fans. We were definately impressed with value for money and would recommend it no worries.

<Content>The Hotel California left us with mixed feelings The best thing about the hotel is its location, on the main shopping street, strewn with bars and restaurants. It is a 15 minute walk from Zoo station (you can get an express train from Shonefield airport to this stop for less than 3 euros). The hotel is not four star. My son and his fiance were unhappy with ripped sheets that were on the bed. They were moved (how odd, it would have been better to change the sheet, surely). The sceond room was dirty and also had holes in the sheets. There are two parts to the hotel and we appeared to be in the least modern. Budget airlines arrive very early in the morning and though you cannot check in until 2pm they will look after your cases. The breakfast room is rather large and always well occupied. On the second day we were down by 7am and two of the fruit drink dispensers were out of drink and neither coffee machine worked. The hot food was already cold and a request for a type of bread for toast was met by a shrug of the shoulders. We only slept in the room, so didn't care for niceties, and while I might try it again, my son and his bride to be would not go anywhere near it.A couple of tips: Brilliant Italian restaurant two doors away, called Petrocellis. Top class. Much further down the street on the opposite side of the road is Hole lin Wah chinese, superb. Sight-seeing tours are excellent. Hop -on hop-on work well. Best things to see are TV Tower, try a boat cruise for one hour, Checkpoint Charlie, Brandenburg Gates, Potsdamer, Reichstag, Holocaust memorial. No end to it. A a fantastic city and not overly expensive. A taxi from the hotel to Shonefeld on Sunday am took 20 mins and for four cost 35 euros. It will take longer during the week. Questions welcomed as ever

<Content>Hot and Sweaty The location of this hotel is probably the best thing going for it. Located centrally and close to many tourist sites, and across the road from the main stop of the hop-on hop-off bus.The staff were helpful and quite nice but the hotel was old and in our opinion far from the 4 stars on the sign. Rooms were tired and old.It was a hot summers day when we arrived and the hotel room was like a sauna and very small, with a tiny bathroom. None of the rooms have air-conditioning so be warned if you are coming in summer.The television in our room did not work properly always stopping and starting like it had a loose wire, and the pay TV system did not work for most of our stay. The room was not cleaned properly with pubic hair in the bed, certainly not what we were looking for, for our honeymoon.Our room looked out to a concrete wall and downstairs all night it sounded like there were bins for the bar with constant banging and crashing.Extremely disappointed.

<Content>Wonderful stay The staff was absolutely fabulous and spoke fluent English. The room was immaculate and the breakfast buffet was above expectations. My family and I really enjoyed the cafe on site. My 5 yr old insists we go back to the hotel again.

<Content>good location Booked this hotel cos we got a great deal on booking.com. The website says it is a 4 star, but it isn't really. More like a 3. It is a pleasant enough hotel, but very dated, especially the bedrooms. On the plus side it is in a great location, near good shopping and restaurants, with lots of transport links just outside the door. Staff were lovely and very helpful. Breakfast was nice too.It is a basic hotel, but well priced.

<Content>Excellent hotel We were very impressed with the Hotel California. I stayed with my wife and two sons, aged 3 and 1 years. Although we only booked the room on the morning of our arrival they were able to provide 2 cots for our sons and gave us a superior room at no additional cost.The room was big ans spotless. It had a huge flat screen tv attached to the wall and a small balcony with a table and chairs.The breakfast buffet was very good. It had a large choice of food, both hot and cold.The hotel is also in an excellent location being on Kurfurstendam. Plenty of shops, restaurants, cafes nearby. The U-bahn and S-bahn stops are a short walk away

<Content>Great Hotel My nephew and I have just returned from a week in Berlin, Germany. Our stay at the Hotel California was really great! The location is truely wonderful- Subways, trains and great restaurants within walking distance. Fabulous shopping on Kurfurstendamm Avenue, where the hotel is located!! The staff went above and beyond to help us with anything we needed. The morning breakfast was served in a very pleasant dining area and the food was excellent. I feel that the room rate was very reasonable. The Hotel California is just perfect for someone who prefers the intimacy of a small European Hotel.

<Content>Terrible weekend in **** California Hotel I am frequent Berlin visitor. I booked superior room for two days on the California Hotel webside. On check-in the receptionist announced that the regular and superior rooms are occupied, so he give us apartament, located in the nearby building. As it turned out apartment was regular flat with a lot of gabrage containers in the front of the windows, equiped as ** hotel, filthy, stinked and dusty. The next day they moved me to the superior room, but not as requested in booking form- non smoking, but the stench of tobacco was not very strong.The breakfast included in the room rate was disaster! Cold, tastelessscrambled eggs, hard bread and smell of old kitchen backroom.Finally, I conclude the only hotel adventage of the California Hotel are great location and nice lobby, they not quarantee you got the room you chose. Never again the **** California Hotel.

<Content>Just insist on getting what you've paid for! I had booked a Superior room because we were going to be there for eight nights and I wanted us to be very comfortable. We arrived late in the afternoon. The room we were given was on the top floor, but must have actually been in the building next door (we had to go out into another stairway and in through a locked door). It was tiny, with no place to put bags or anything else, only one bed lamp, the TV was a flat screen about 9 or 10 feet high that could only be watched from the bed with a craned neck, and the flushed toilet splashed on the seat. I had seen photos on the hotel's web site of what must have been a Superior room, and this certainly wasn't. I immediately went down to complain, and was told that this WAS a Superior room (I鈥檓 sure that wasn鈥檛 true), but if we weren鈥檛 satisfied with it, we could change the next day, as they were fully booked. We seemed to have no choice, so unpacked as little as possible that night. The next day, we repacked before going out for the day so our bags could be moved. When we returned to our new room, we were very pleased. The room was lovely, on the same floor, but before the double doors, large, pleasant, and definitely a Superior room. If we had only had it from the beginning . . .So our warning is as follows -- don't be taken in by the smooth-talking reception desk staff and insist on getting what you have paid for!

<Content>There when we needed it We ended up missing our flight home to Glasgow so had to go back into the city to find a place to stay. We chanced upon the Hotel California right on Ku'damm and asked for availability and got a room for 74 euros for the night which we thought was a bargain. The room was clean, the staff friendly and the breakfast was huge. I'd recommend it.

<Content>Don't look like a tourist at Hotel California! Hotel mostly good, but watch out if you are dressed in jeans like a tourist. I've repeatedly been treated less favourably (service quality) than people in suits. Otherwise a nice hotel in a good location. We are in a first floor room - it is extremely noisy in the morning. Ask for a room on a higher floor where it might be quieter.

<Content>Very good location, nice big room To be honest, I was a bit worried about the quality of the hotel from the name of it (sounds a bit whimsical). But was pleasantly surprised when I got there, to discover a nice and classic looking hotel, that the room was spacious, and the staff very friendly and fluent in English. There was even a complimentary bottle of California Red for me in my room. Bathroom was a decent size too. I could only watch 2 TV channels (CNN and BBC world), and trying to use the internet in the room (not free) was quite difficult (gave up and and used the free internet on the hotel's desktop downstairs instead, but it's not usually avaiable as people are always using it). The hotel has very good breakfast, and for people who were attending the big exhibition that I was in Berlin for, there was even a complimentary afternoon tea, coffee  Snacks session for us in the late afternoon to welcome us back to the hotel. Location is great too. Very close to Uhlandstrasse station and in a safe, clean and central neighbourhood. Making it a very good place for us to stay in.

<Content>Excellent Central Hotel Excellent hotel, great location for sightseeing and shops. Friendly staff, good English. Hotel very clean, modern  good quality - parts were being refurbished when we stayed but no intrusive noise for guests. Excellent buffet breakfast. Ask for a room with a balcony - a bit more expensive but well worth it for the huge room, good views of Kurfurstendamm  fresh air (not noisy at all due to double glazing)! Can not recommend this hotel highly enough, we really enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Welcome to the Hotel California! The staff was friendly and fluent in English. The buffet breakfast had a good variety of food and beverages. The room was small but comfortable. This hotel is conveniently located near a U-bahn stop. The only drawback was the shortage of hot water in the mornings.
