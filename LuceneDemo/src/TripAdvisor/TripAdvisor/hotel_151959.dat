<Content>Crazy about the Hotel Belgica My husband I stayed at the Belgica for 3 nights during a business/vacation trip to Ponce. The personnel at the hotel is very warm and friendly (like family)...especially Maria (the daytime clerk) while we were there. She was helpful in recommending restaurants, give us directions to other towns and took the time to share some of the culture of Ponce. The hotel is OK for a short stay (no pool). However, if you are looking for a clean room with a great view of the town, this is the hotel for you. You cannot beat the price per night and they also offer a continental breakfast. There are several other cafes and resturants for full breakfasts and also lunch and dinner. We will be returning to Ponce very shortly and will again stay at the Belgica. Oh, by the way, if you are a couple, ask for room #19...it has a balconey and a wonderful view of the city. Can be a little noisey if you are a light sleeper. However, it is worth it...spacious room, modern bath and great bed!!

<Content>Beautiful Quaint Place in Ponce My husband and I had a good experience at the Belgica Hotel. We were there for one night from May 22-23. We arrived almost 10pm to check in, and the lady at the front desk was very nice. She was not able to direct us properly to the hotel when we called earlier to ask for directions, but, she turned out to be so apologetic, sincere, and helpful afterall wtih settling us in, that we did not even think of the inconvenience we had driving to the hotel. The facilities were excellent as well. We had a balcony, had a good view of the street and the quaint buildings. The bed, the sheets, the sink, the toilet, the TV, the whole room was beautiful. I love the preserved windows and trimmings of the room. They even had breakfast in the morning. Personnel were polite. Hotel was very clean. VERY NICE!

<Content>Do not miss this one. Went to visit historic Ponce just this week. First the only problem with Ponce is that all the highways are doing construction. Once you find the Hotel Belgica it will be worth all the wait. You walk into this historic old building in literally the center of ponce. Dont stay at this hotel if you are looking for the most up to date services. Rooms dont have phones, there is no pool, and there is no elevator. This hotel is truly for people who like old world charm at very cheap prices. Emma and Joel are great and they will give you detailed maps of what to do. Beware though that typical spanish restaurants close very early so make sure you eat a big lunch. My personal recommendation is the restaurant literally across the street. Dont remember the name but its the only thing across the street. Enjoy Ponce

<Content>Nice place near all Found the place as reviewed. An older, adequately maintained property that is within 20 yds of Ponce's main square. No elevator so you will be carrying your own bags up marble staircases. Take an inner room as it is quieter, but each floor has a common veranda which you can use at will.Friendly. helpful staff who allowed us to park right in front of the hotel rather than have to use the public parking lot which is a few blocks away. NB it is in a night life area so you may not be able to park directly on the street the hotel is located on if you try to park on a weekend night. However there is plenty of street parking nearby and within walking distance.Also if you visit the City's tourist office located in the old firehouse on the square before you register, you will get a discount booklet which, when we visited, had a coupon from the hotel with a 3 nights for the price of two deal.All in all a good value.

<Content>marvelous hotel - only one problem We really loved most everything about Hotel Belgica - the service, staff, room, and location was great. The rooms are so nicely decorated and spacious - our favorite room of our 10 day trip to Puerto Rico. Its right outside the City Square where all the shops are and some good restaurants nearby. We got a great deal, $75 a night for a spacious King room with a nice balcony. The only problem we had - we stayed here on a weekend (political primary weekend at that) and the kids were noisy. There were your usual young kids driving by and playing music loudly and a lot of kids yelling and screaming outside til about 3 am, and we could hear it all. I don't know if it is always like this, but it is something I would check on with the hotel, because there was a lot of noise. All in all, we had a great stay though.

<Content>so many hassles so little time arrived 4 a.m. after being completely lost in a downtown full of torn up streets, no street signs, hopelessly incorrect maps through help of a good samaritan. I had called and reserved for that time but no room! After some discussion (in Spanish with night man) I walked around the area but nothing available. Went back, told him I would sleep in car and then expect room in the morning. Suddenly a room was available (but only for a few hours), OK by me. In morning they moved me to a room with a wall AC that was so loud I couldn't even hear the TV. Finally the second night I complained and was moved to a room with cardboard walls and smell of cigarette smoke from next room.  They did not charge for the first night and I thanked them for that, but then they wanted each night paid....no paying at check out! Freezer outside in dark to get your ice, chip it out of a block. Park your car a few blocks away or hope to find a place on the street. No internet connections, a coffee pot and some cookies on the counter for continental breakfast.  It was a traditional old hotel, kept very clean which was about the only positive thing I can think of. I thought for the price it was a rip-off.

<Content>Great Location Location right off town square. Lovely old style rooms with modern bath. Nice balcony on street. Staff gave excellent directions especially considering road work, etc. going on at the time. Also, staff was helpful in recommending places to eat.

<Content>Very affordable and comfortable I stayed in Ponce for the weekend, and this was the most affordable hotel I could find. Although the hotel was a little hard to find, due to the million one-way streets, it was very enjoyable.The hotel room was very clean, and the A/C worked perfectly. However, I did have to go the reception desk to request washcloths, as that seemed to be a rarity there. The rooms were unusually small, and the TV did not have cable at all. But you get what you pay for. All-in-all, I had a great experience, and the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. For the money, I would definitely stay there again. Although, I would bring a dvd player to watch movies.

<Content>Saved our Vacation!!! My wife and I had booked a room in Cabo Rojo. The room proved to be the biggest mistake of our vacation. We did try to tough it out there, but decided during our sleepless night that we would be leaving in the morning. We were determined to find a place to stay and made our way to Ponce. We were lucky to have found Hotel Belgica. It is in the heart of Ponce and offers very convenient access to the beautiful attractions that Ponce has to offer. We chose a windowless room on the advice of one of the employees to avoid the noise of the nightlife. The room was very clean and the staff was very polite and helpful in getting around the town. We will definitely keep Hotel Belgica in mind on our next trip to Puerto Rico.A good tip before you decide to do ANYTHING. Take the trolley tour for $2.00 offered at the Fire House. With the tour, you get a coupon book with tons of great offers. We visited the Museum de Ponce BEFORE we took the tour. The coupon book had a nice discount for visiting the museum. Not only do you get the savings book, the tour itself is more than worth the price of admission. The tour is given in both Spanish and English. The trolley stops at a sports museum, observes one of the oldest and biggest trees in Ponce, and stops at a Cemetery which has been converted into a museum due to its historical significance. One trip on the trolley does not do it justice. It is a must see attraction on any vacation to Ponce.

<Content>Very clean, comfortable hotel with more charm than Ponce itself We had a room with a king sized bed and a balcony, which was a bit noisy at night with the traffic below. However, the room was large and nicely furnished. The high ceilings and original details were lovely. The bathroom seemed recently renovated and spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable, lighting pleasant, a/c quiet and effective. I highly recommend the hotel, but not Ponce. The Lonely Planet guidebook we had was very misleading. We planned two nights there, but left after one. There was only one restaurant open for dinner. We walked and walked looking for someplace to eat breakfast, and the only place we could find was a food counter in a store. The center square was mostly deserted except for a few drunks, and was mostly just bare dirt around the trees. Only a couple of the buildings around it were nice. All in all, Ponce had a depressed and deserted feeling to it.

<Content>Worst experience ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had to stay at the Belgica for one night, should I say nightmare. First, I was told by the hotel that they have a parking area wich is the street!!!!!! On the night that I arrived at the hotel, there was a sort of festival at the square so there was no space on the street to leave my car. They could not care less and advised me on leave the car somewhere in town and that meant 3 blocks away that a I had to walk back with my lugages because there where no personell at the hotel to help me. While I was doing that and when I arrived at the hotel, I was told that they could not find my reservation. It was late so I had to beg to the employee to make a new one and give me a room. The room was clean. Next day I checked out. Two weeks later I got two charges on my credit card, the one that I used and the one they found. I am puertorrican and I live in this island and I dont think that anyone deserves this kind of service.

<Content>Super friendly, charming hotel. Full of character. Old tiles, nice staircase, windows with wooden doors, funny fake flowers everywhere.. The owner meet us at the counter, walked out the door of his hotel and help us find street parking (not that easy midday). Told us all the places to go. Very central location. The rooms were old world basic and nice. We had a balcony, lots of hot water, very high ceilings, air conditioning, and a water cooler in the hall. Finally felt like we were in a different country. Ponce is very attractive. I prefered this value hotel over the hotels I visited around the plaza. Two of use stayed for $65. $50 less than the other hotels. Service was very helpful. He told us all the exhibits in the area, gave us maps, where to find good reasonible food and restaurants all over town. Even if the owner hadn't given us such first class treatment the hotel has old world charm without being contrived.

<Content>Friendy and Unique I stayed at the Hotel Belgica during my first trip to Puerto Rico last month. The Hotel was hard to locate based on the on-line directions we were given, but once we found it we were relieved to have a pleasant stay. The staff is very friendly, and eager to learn more English from mainland US natives. They asked us to park in a spot on the street where they could keep an eye on our car, and gave us an extra mattress for a member of our party without extra charge.Both the lobby and rooms have lots of character and charm. The lobby is covered on all sides with large ornate mirrors, and the very high ceilings in the rooms make the rooms almost as high as they are wide.The rooms opening to the front balconies do not have windows -- but that is ok; it makes it easier to sleep in without the morning light peaking through.I did see one roach in the bathroom, but had no other cleanliness issues with this hotel. We were even given washcloths upon request -- a rarity in Puerto Rico, we found!

<Content>Calm and clean This nice hotel sort of made up for how dead Ponce was on a Sunday afternoon. It was clean, there was hot water in the nice bathroom, the airconditioner was great. We had a balcony room but since we were running the airconditioner we couldn't keep the doors open of course! So, no windows. But it's a nice non-touristy place.

<Content>Great staff, uncomfortable rooms. We choose Hotel Belgica because of its prime location in Ponce, the affordable rate, and the historical aspects of this hotel. The room itself was not comfortable...no windows or lamps or an iron. Our bathroom was filled with little roaches. I kept my suitcase on the dresser and never walked around without any shoes on. However the staff was extremely nice. We got lost on our way there and someone from the hotel came out to get us and led us to the hotel. The location was perfect...we walked right outside the door and had access to everything Ponce offered. Parking was free. The lobby of the hotel was beautiful. If you're adventureous and on a budget, then you can probably handle this place.

<Content>Skip it Half the rooms have no windows. We wanted to stay at this hotel because of the description of the balconies. We were put in rooms with no windows. One room had no key to the door, so everytime we returned, we had to have someone go up with the master key. We switched to a room with a balcony and it had no glass in the windowpane. It was just a wooden door to the outside balcony. Spend your money someplace else.
