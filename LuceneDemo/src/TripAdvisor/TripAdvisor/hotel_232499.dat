<Content>dreadful rooms clearly some people have very low standards. We travel a fair bit and Ive had small rooms before in cities, but well done. These were minute and awful (circa 1978). Put it like this, I couldnt get to the wardrobe without climbing over the bed and it was impossible to turn around in the bathroom. Not sure how they actually got a double bed in it. The bed was hugely uncomfortable and decor was old and tatty. TV didnt work. If it was really cheap-say 拢60 a night then I would have put up with it but it was over 鈧?20 a night.The woman was also very unfriendly and we had to pay in full before we even saw the room as we checked in. As the reception area is quite pleasant we did so. Never again till I see a room. They also the day before we arrived had taken a nights deposit on my card (which i didnt know) and then proceeeded to charge us for the full nights when we were there. It took me 12 days to get this extra night back on my card. They refused when i called them to phone up and knock off the extra nights authorisation.Breakfast boring (hence went out after the first day) and served by someone desparate to clear my plate as fast as I ate.I rarely complain about anywhere, indeed usually leave good reviews but this place took the biscuit.-a thoroughly joyless place and presumably could only be liked by people who had never stayed anywhere reasonable but well done.Loved Amsterdam though and despite the hotel had a great time.

<Content>Too expensive for quality We stayed for a weekend in Oct 08 and first impression of the hotel were good. It was situated in a quiet residential street very close to Vondel Park and close to good restaurants and cafes. We were directed to a basement level room, number 8 which was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. You need to expect small rooms in Amsterdam but this I would describe as claustrophobic. There were two tiny single beds and the bathroom had just enough room to stand in. The decor was quite poor and there was a hole punched in through the plaster above one of the beds. We asked straight away for a move and the receptionist let us see room 10 next door which was the same size but a slightly better layout. We decided to take this room as there was no other choice and thought it won't be bad as we would be out most of the time. We were awoke the following morning very early by the sounds of the dining room right above us and tables and chairs scraping so loud they could be heard through ear plugs! The bathroom ceiling was also covered in mildew. Like a previous reviewer I felt like checking out despite already paying up front but we managed to get a room on an upstairs floor for our second night which, was much better, light and airy but still small. I will point out that the rooms were clean but I am not sure that the health and safety hazard of blocking fire escapes with laundry trolleys would go down well with the fire service.Breakfast was cramped, especially Sunday morning but the waitress did set us up a space at the bar which was not easy but better that waiting around.Overall my opinion of the Prinsen is disappointing. This is the first time I have ever requested a room change at a hotel and my stay here had a negative effect on the weekend. I would not stay again nor recommend this hotel based on my experience. It was only 30 euros more than we paid to stay at the nearby Marriot.

<Content>Prinsen is a prince Our first visit to Amsterdam and there were so many hotels to choose from, this was recommended by a friend who lives in Amsterdam for its convenience to most major attractions. The hotel is small  since space is such a premium in Amsterdam our room reflected this. However bedding and towels were spotless, bed was comfortable and it was quiet at night even though we had to sleep with the window open (no air conditioning). We were within a stonesthrow of the main bar and restaurant area and canal system. We recommend the waterbus which you can travel on all day (get on/off where you want). Don't miss Anne Frank museum though booking is advisable or you will queue for ages. The 'Red Light District' was fun to visit at night - an eye opener for me! There is so much to see and do in this city - the Prinsen was an added bonus.

<Content>rather disappointing hotel The location is good with good public transport nearby. T he breakfast is generous and varied. However the rooms are tiny and the bathrooms very basic. The mattress on our bed was horrible and uncomfortable. In future, we will not stay at this hotel.

<Content>Delightful Very convenient - a tram ride away from Central Station, near a park, canal (with boat trips) Leidesplein and Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum. We had a ground floor garden room which was clean and big enough with nice bathroom and TV (with BBC1 and 2). Very quiet except for noisy green parakeets which squawked from sunrise to sunset (and I'm a bird lover!). Large buffet breakfast. Helpful staff and lovely cat (Spencer).

<Content>dissapointment I checked the hotel's website out and it seemed very nice.....but when we got there what a disappointment! The rrom as small but lovely.The real problem was with the owner of this hotel. He was impolite. He told us  I kick you out if you don't make this .... and that..... He treated us like we were his own property. He talked to much and not to the subject.I advise anyone to stay at this hotel.

<Content>adequate but small rooms We booked the Prinsen Hotel through the room-finding service of the Tourist Office outside Centraal Station in Amsterdam. Upon arrival (about 11 AM) we were told the room would be ready at 2 PM, but we were welcome to store our luggage there until then.On our return we easily checked in (using the printouts the Tourist Office had given us). We were kind of dismayed at how small the room was. There was very little storage space, so we weren't able to unpack.Good features: very quiet, warm, clean, good breakfast, elevator, convenient to Leidseplein and trams.The downside: the very small room, and some of the reception staff were not overly helpful/knowledgeable.We thought overall the Prinsen was a bit overpriced for what we got, although we had no major complaints.

<Content>Nothing to write home about We have just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam staying in the Prinsen Hotel. I had booked the hotel through another website and e-mailed the hotel 8 days prior to arrival to check the booking, there was a misunderstanding with the booking and I needed to e-mail them through all documentation that I had received regarding my booking, after this the misunderstanding was cleared up. On arrival to the hotel they said the the voucher that I produced was not the correct one and that they would let us stay this time but if it happens again we will not get a room. I was shocked by this as I had cleared all misunderstanings earlier that week.We had a double room booked and on arrival to our room we found 2 single beds in a very small room with a very very small bathroom. The room was clean and cleaned daily. The Prinsen hotel is noisy during the night and at breakfast time. I think that our room was located below the breakfast room which contributed to the noise but sleep-in were not optional for us. The location of the hotel is good with a good tram service about a 3 min walk from the hotel. I will be returning to Amsterdam but not to this hotel the price was too much for the room!

<Content>No probs at the prinsen! Group of 5 of us stayed at the Prinsen, 1st - 3rd December 2007. Decided to book after reading the reviews on trip advisor. All in all was not disappointed in the slightest. Just a 5 minutes walk from the Leidesplein in a quiet street and located near the Marriott. Okay the bedrooms are fairly small but on a city break you only sleep there - They were both clean and comfortable. Breakfast was continental, ie eggs, ham, bread, cheese. Reception open 24 hours with a very small bar adjacent.The only slight complaint was the young chap behind the reception who seemed to be more interested in playing on the internet rather than helping us with any questions. Overall though would recommend.

<Content>Good position, tiny room We have just returned from a week-end at the Prinsen Hotel in Amsterdam. We really appreciated its convenient position, close to the tram stop (3 lines to Dam/Central station, max. waiting time was 3 minutes) and in a very busy district, packed with restaurants and bars. The room was very quiet and overlooked a beautiful garden. The staff were generally kind and helpful. However, the room was very tiny, and the bathroom could have been cleaner. The breakfast was very basic, and it took ages to have a table cleared or get a cup of tea. We spent over 100 euros per night and we expected something better.

<Content>What a dissapointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our travel agent recommended this hotel. I also checked the hotel's website out and it seemed very nice.....but when we got there.....what a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!! The room was so small, big enough for one person only. I suspect that they booked us into one of their single rooms for the price of a double room. (the photos on their website is VERY misleading)The mattres was worn out and very soft. Not suitable for a person with back problems. A VERY BAD odour was in the bathroom all the time and filled the bedroom if the bathroom door was left open. Sorry, I can't recommend this hotel to even my worst enemy!!I question the fact that this hotel is rated as a 3 STAR hotel!!!!?????????Dissapointed and misledSouth Africa

<Content>Loved the Prinsen We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and really enjoyed it. The room was a bit small but the really comfy bed made up for it. The staff really helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the breakfasts, but we did take our own travel kettle with us. It was so easy to find once we came off the tram, just a few minutes walk. We will go back to this hotel again.

<Content>1st visit to Amsterdam - Good choice of hotel I stayed in the Prinsen Hotel with my sister and my daughter. The weekend break was to help celebrate my sister's 'milestone' birthday. We shared a triple room on the third floor. It was light and airy, just big enough for the 3 of us, it was clean and looked well cared for. The bathroom was spotless. And the staff were all really friendly and helpful. We were pleasantly surprised how quiet the location was. But just around the corner it was all there for us. Everything we had come to Amsterdam to see. I would recommend this hotel in an instant and would certainly consider staying there again

<Content>Perfect Primsen with ebookers i had an exceptionally pleasant experience with the Prinsen Hotel last month. I booked a 3 night stay with ebookers.com - was slightly worried about the good deal I got, because I thought that the hotel might be cutting corners. Anyway, reaching the hotel was easy as it is located close to the metro station and the directions on the ebookers website actually were very helpful. The hotel staff was friendly and the room which I got had a lovely view. The staff themselves pointed that out, saying that the room allocated to me was one floor lower and they had thought that I might like this room better.

<Content>Nice Hotel We have just returned from Amsterdam after spending 3 nights at this hotel. I was a bit wary of what to expect after reading some of the reviews but on the whole this small hotel was more than adequate. Yes i agree the rooms are small but they were spotless as was the bathroom. The breakfast was lovely and plentiful. There was a smell near the downstairs loos but i had the room next to these and you could not smell anything once in your room and bear in mind you are right next to a canal?. Staff were helpful and approachable and couldn't do enough to help. the only disapointment was that there was no comfortable bar sitting area to have a drink after a long days walking. I would certainly stay there again in future and could recomend it as a base for a weekends stay.

<Content>Dreadful Hotel I stayed in the Prinsen September 2005 on a business trip. This was for a trade fair, and lots of hotels were fully booked when I came to book. However, this one was not which, in hindsight, is not surprising. The room was tiny - the dreadful thing was that the walls were full of squashed flies and spiders. Really something I've never seen in a hotel. There was enough room to open the door, and get into bed. The bathroom smelled odd at times, but the tiling seemed recently renovated and was ok.Breakfast was ok, but all that was on offer was the cheapest kind of sliced bread and muffins with various toppings.I cut short my stay in this hotel and moved elsewhere, as it was so poor. I will never stay in this hotel again.

<Content>the rooms I went for a week away and i couldn't enter our bathroom because the smell was so terrible. The only time it smelt half decent was after a shower or a bath. The shower was a no go area aswell because every time you used it the floor got soaking wet! As you will know hotel rooms usually have a safe in. In may our safe was on the highest shelf in the wardrobe and therefore to access our belongings we had to stand on a chair.

<Content>Went for my stag do. loved it Me and 15 friends went to amsterdam for my stag do. we stayed at the prinsen. we stayed in a mix of 3 and 2 bed rooms. It was quite cheap, 50 euro per person per night for all rooms. Great location 5 mins from the leidesplein area. staff really friendly and a nice beer garden at the back.The rooms were tiny but we were only there to shower and sleep. The rooms were clean though. The breakfast was terrible (but thats continental breakfasts for you) and I brought a white towel with me that was taken by the cleaners (out of my case).For group bookings its brilliant. Dont think id go with just my fiancee/wife.

<Content>Loved it all My self and my husband have just come home from the amazing City of Amsterdam. We stayed at the Prinsen Hotel. When we arrived last Sunday we were given a room with twin beds, it was a small room but was clean and overlooked the garden so we didnt mind. The next morning at breakfast the receptionist came over and said she had been thinking about us and would like to change our room to a bigger room with a double bed. We were delighted to move, that room was not available the day before, so up we moved to a pleasent room. The hotel is very clean with a change of towels every day and cleaned every day, the hotel staff are friendly and helpfull. The breakfast is self service but you can have as much as you like. The only thing was the bar was very small and it was not a place you could come back to at night and have a few drinks, but there are plenty of bars on the way, Anyway we enjoyed it all.

<Content>Wonderful city, terrible hotel Myself and My husband stayed at the Prinsen for 3 nights in march this year. The room was the tiniest room I have ever stayed in. You couldnt even sit fully on the loo or you would have hit your head on the wall. We couldnt stand up together in the room it was too cramped, my husband had to sit on the bed if I was getting dressed or anything. Absolute nightmare, on the plus side the staff were very friendly so if you dont mind staying in a room the size of a postage stamp, go for it. It is in an excellent location central to the heart of all the action.

<Content>Good For A Weekend Away! Stayed here with a group of girlfriends - hotel is in a fantastic situation - close to everything you could want, but also very quiet! The hotel rooms are small, but they are clean  comfortable. I've stayed in Amsterdam before  hotel rooms are small due to the narrow buildings - so if you like vast suites, it's probably not the city for you! Staff very friendly. Tax not applicable if you pay cash. Only thing I will say - proprieter moaned that we weren't paying enough as we'd been given week rates for a weekend stay - not our problem!

<Content>Just the thing I stayed at this hotel last year and would recommend it to anyone. At the time I was 17, visiting Amsterdam on my own for the first time, and was a bit nervous about what the hotel would be like, but I shouldn't have worried. On arrival I was greeted by friendly staff, willing to chat away to me in fluent english (as almost everyone does in Amsterdam). The room wasn't the biggest I've ever stayed in, but it was clean, tidy, and had everything I needed - a TV, safe, en-suite bathroom with shower, storage space, hairdryer and phone. The hotel serves a great breakfast every morning, included in the room price, which I thought was great. In terms of location it's perfect - a five minute walk away from Leidseplein, three minutes from the gorgeous Vondelpark, and close to all the major tram stops. Despite being so close to all the action, it's really quiet at night as the hotel is on a side street next to the park. If you're looking for a friendly, well-priced hotel right in the heart of Amsterdam, then go to this one -you wont be disappointed!

<Content>Prinsen Hotel at Amsterdam: Horrible!! Amsterdam is a great city, it's very beautiful, those who don't know it should go there, you'll have a great time. Nevertheless, don't even think to book a room at Prinsen Hotel. Although it is very well situated, it is extremely expensive for the service they offer. I don't know how are the other rooms but the one where we have just spent 3 nights was really tiny and there was place for the bed only, not for the baggage, and we couldn't open the window at night for part of it remained over the bed. Unfortunately, there has been about 30潞C these days so we hardly could sleep at night. The only answer we got from the people at reception was that they felt hot at their homes as well.For such an unpleasant place we had to pay per night 125鈧?+ city taxes (14% This tax is applied everywhere) + 4% (just because we paid with credit card, the only place in the whole city where we had to pay a plus), simply incredible!!Although Amsterdam is an expensive place, I think that better hotels can be found. Good luck and have a good time there!
