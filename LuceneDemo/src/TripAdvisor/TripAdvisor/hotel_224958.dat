<Content>Amazing service for vets and active-duty alike Booked this hotel on the spur of the moment on Christmas night, based off recommendations online and from friends that had stayed here. Was amazed at the quality of the location and services offered for the price. Members (yes, you must become a member in order to get the choice prices) receive a huge discount on stays at this location and numerous exchange locations, but the good thing is that active-duty military get free membership on-site. Not a bad deal. Our pet was welcome to stay with us (small extra fee--$12) and we received free cocktails during happy hour and a full breakfast the following morning. The bed was comfortable, the room was spotless, and the staff was most helpful. It is located near Central Square and within walking distance of China Town (two must-sees in San Francisco). Weekday rates are slightly lower than weekend rates, but both are extremely reasonable for the location. Overall, a great experience.

<Content>Great value coupled with the Marine Corps experience I have been a member of MMC for about 15 years and have stayed there nearly every time I have been in SF. The club continues to improve, particularly under the newer GM, MajGen Myatt, USMC Retired. The rooms have all been renovated as has the bar and restaurant on the top floor. I have also used their reciprocal clubs in Boston (Union Club) and Washington DC (Army Navy Club). The rooms are very nice, the breakfast buffet plentiful and the pours at happy hour generous. The staff is gracious, some having been there for 25 years. The hotel is in the heart of downtown, a short walk from the Bart and cable cars. The prices are a bargain for downtown SF if you are a member.

<Content>If you're in the military, stay here! Whenever I'm in San Francisco, this is the ONLY place I'll stay! It's central, it's fantastic value, and it's exclusively for the military!The rooms are just fantastic, given the cost of them! Spacious, with great bathrooms and comfortable beds! You don't always get a great view, but there's something wrong with you if you don't head into this vibrant city the second you arrive!As far as food goes, I've only ever had breakfast here, but that is always to the highest standard, and there's loads of it! The view from the breakfast room is wonderful, as it's a 'downtown' hotel, and who can argue with the free bar at happy hour?! A must for the discerning British traveller...Overall, this is one of my top-rated hotels, and I thoroughly recommend it if you're eligible to stay here!

<Content>Best Location in San Francisco This hotel has the best location for a visit to SF. It is just a couple blocks from Union Square. Tons of great restaurants, both high end and cheap. The restaurant next door is great. Lots of nightlife, nightclubs, bars, shows. China Town is a few blocks away. You can walk to almost everything. If you are willing to take the bus, which I recommend fun people watching and very affordable, you can catch a bus to almost anywhere you want to go to in SF from this area as well. I can't say enough about the location. As far as the hotel goes, it is a GREAT deal if you are a member. If you are not a member than the price is still not bad. The rooms are basic, but comfortable. The beds and bedding above average. The bathrooms are small, but the closets are very big, walk in closets with a mini fridge and coffee maker. Everything is very practical-military. There is even a clothse line in the shower. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. The best part about the hotel is the top floor restaurant and bar. Great views of the city. The breakfast, included, is good. In the evening there is a happy hour, also included. If we weren't up to hanging out for happy hour we would grab some beers and put them in our mini fridge for later. If possible stay on a higher floor, because you are in the middle of the city, so there is street noise. I just brought earplugs and had no problems. Even if you are not a member, you can really save $$ by staying at this hotel with all the extras included. Remember this is not a fancy place, but very comfortable and convienent.

<Content>Awesome Hotel in San Francisco I am proud to be a member of the Marine's Memorial Club, and always stay at this hotel when in San Francisco. On this trip, my wife and I were returning from a week in wine country, and rested in the San Francisco city center before returning back to Cincinnati.Besides being a wonderful living tribute to the Marines, the hotel is very accommodating to members and members of reciprical clubs, in addition to active members of the military.The Leatherneck Steak house serves wonderful steaks, and has a great open bar between 4-6 PM. It reminded me of many Officers Clubs that I have frequented over a long military career.I hope that you have the chance to stay here. Great internet connections and complimentary breakfast included.Semper Fi!

<Content>Excellent value, great location The Marine's Memorial hotel is centrally located in downtown San Francisco, within walking distance of Chinatown, the Moscone convention center, cable car stops and many excellent restaurants and designer stores. The hotel itself has clean rooms with comfortable beds with nice conforter and soft pillows. The rooms are good size, but the bathrooms are small and towels are not very good quality. My room had no tub, just a shower which was fine for me. There is free internet access in every room, but for some reason I could never get my connection to work. There is complementary hot breakfast every morning and free cocktails from 4-6 pm every day at the hotel restaurant on the top floor. There is also a business center on the 4th floor with 4 PCs and a network printer which is very convenient. Another excellent amenity is free access to One Club (gym) in the basement. The full service fitness center has an indoor lap pool. The hotel overall has a dated feel to it, but it's central location, excellent amenites and friendly staff override any other negative aspect. I would definitly stay at the Marine Memorial's hotel on my next visit to San Francisco.

<Content>City Noise! Clean, dark, spacious room at a very reasonable price in Union Square. Beautiful view from dining room at pleasant breakfast.  BUT WE ARE GROUCHY at breakfast, because, poor sound insulation deprived us of sleep. There isn鈥檛 air conditioning. No need to close windows to exclude street noise and prevent cool air from refreshing the room. Sounds are the same鈥ith windows open or closed; LOUD and BOISTEROUS.

<Content>Location/Parking Best Part Location is the best part of this hotel, close to Union Square, shopping and theaters. Also, great parking rates in comparison to other 3 star hotels. Rooms are basic, clean but nothing special. Rooms facing courtyard and other buildings are rather dark. Upstairs restaurant and bar are nice with a piano player. Breakfast when we stayed was a basic buffet (some fruit, some scrambled eggs, etc., nothing cooked to order). The staff were very nice. The entrance/lobby has some very interesting historic memorabilia. Basically, would rate this as a 2.5 to 3 star, with a small bathroom, clean bed, pleasant staff and great location. MIght stay here again, but only for one night.

<Content>Excellent value and great service My husband attended a meeting last week at the Marine Hotel, and I tagged along. The Marine Hotel is an unsung gem. For the meeting rate of $150 a night, we both got full American breakfast, a two hour cocktail reception in the afternoon, and use of Club One Fitness, a full-service gym on the ground level of the hotel. The room was quite nice. Service was great - very friendly, and after a couple days we felt like family. As long as one doesn't have a problem with the fairly heavy military influence, it's a lovely place to stay and a tremendous value.

<Content>Great Value in the Centre of San Francisco This is an unusual hotel in so far as it is actually a private club open to the public. The clientele are generally retired Mraines and their families, and the ambience is military and perhaps a touch sombre.That said, the suite we occupied for 3 nights was clean, well laid out and comprehensively equipped. The decor was rather heavy on the browns and yellows and the bedrooms and public rooms could do with a makeover. But everything worked just fine.Breakfast was comprehensive and excellent value, there is a free Happy Hour in the bar in the early evening, and dinner and snacks were pleasant.The staff were without exception all friendly and helpful. The location is excellent : right by Union Square, with valet parking just up the street at a special rate. All-in-all the place is recommended for those who don't m nd a rather dated look to their hotel as a trade off for good value at a good location.

<Content>Home away from Home We attended an Marine reunion and stayed at the Marine Memorial Club for five nights. We were very pleased with the hotel employees especially the front desk personnel and the concierge staff. We enjoyed the buffet breakfasts and the evening happy hours. The room on the eleven floor where we held our banquet was beautiful and the meal was outstanding. We found the atmosphere to be in the marine tradition and would recommend this hotel to veterans when visiting San Francisco.

<Content>We always choose the Marines Our family has been using the Marines Memorial for about 15 years now and it just keeps improving. The rooms have been upgraded, the public spaces well maintained and the restaurant food is tastier. Our main reasons for staying loyal to this hotel are the great value and the wonderful staff. There is not much staff turnover so we get to see the same wonderful people each time we go there.

<Content>SF = Semper Fi I stayed here on a business trip to San Francisco in January 2006. The price is much lower than similar name chain hotels. I am retired military, so they gave me a very nice, recently renovated room. I think some rooms are not as nice.I had a great time. They have a nice library, a free breakfast and happy hour. The staff was very helpful. The health club is run by a fitness company and has state of the art equipment and facilities. I recommend it highly.

<Content>Great stay--great value--for military families What an amazing value for military families! the active duty room rate is RIDICULOUSLY low (you must call directly to book this rate), especially considering the prices of nearby hotels. A hot, delicious breakfast was included, as well as happy hour where the staff spoiled us with GT's and our kids with Shirley Temples. It is convenient to mass transport (we took buses and cable car--get the 3 day pass for $18.00/free for kids), some quick, kid friendly eats (try Jasmine's for burgers and Tagine for Moroccan) and includes in-room internet. The on-site memorabilia, library, and salute to Marines lost in the War on Terror are also a good way to spend a quiet morning. best of all was the new friends we made from every service, era and generation. Thank you MM staff and volunteers for all you do for those who serve!

<Content>Elegant huge suite with sky-high ceilings....wow! Although $380 a night sounds outrageous, Suite #304 was the biggest hotel suite I've seen in my life. A small foyer led to a spacious living room, large bathroom (with separate vanity area), and a separate bedroom with door. The ceilings were incredibly high and the room reminded me of old San Francisco at its best. The Marines Memorial Club is very conveniently located in downtown S.F. The garage is a few doors down in the Olympic Garage but they do offer in and out privileges, which is useful.There was a hot breakfast buffet as well as a free two hour cocktail reception, and free newspaper daily.Although I'd safely say the room was overpriced, and would have been more accurately priced at around $250, I have no complaints, and it was convenient as we were attending a family wedding reception in the ballroom.It is a beautiful property!

<Content>Not your typical hotel The wartime memoriabilia, the grand ornate decor, and the built-in theatre, all add up to be a bit of a strange hotel to stay at. If you are not a veteran, and you don't like dark oppressive furnishings, this is probably not the place for you.The restaurant on the 12th floor, however, is a refreshing break from the rest of the hotel. It has lots of windows and affords a panoramic view of the city.The room I stayed in was small, smelled of something old, and was dark. The only window in the room faced the wall of another building. Still I paid $175/night although it does come with complimentary breakfast and late afternoon cocktails.

<Content>Great Place to stay! The only problem we had was we had reserved a room with 2 double beds and when we checked in were given a queen bed (even though we were early). Eventually we were put into a king size bed and the room was very nice. The staff was very nice and helpful. The room was very clean and well maintained. The complimentary breakfast was also superb even with excellent fresh fruit! At a rate of $89 a night for members (I guess the rate went up), I would definitely recommend the place and would surely stay there again!

<Content>Seen better days Our family's trip to San Francisco included a 3 night stay at the Marines' Memorial Club on Sutter Street in downtown San Francisco. The location was fantastic with accessibility to public transportation and within walking distance to much of this beautiful city. The hotel however has seen better days. Small rooms being irrelevant (most are small in this area), the main problem throughout the hotel was a housekeeping issue. No attempt had been made in months to wipe baseboards or clean corners. Our bathroom sink was never wiped up the whole time we were there except by us. Trash was piled up and cobwebs were present everywhere around the hotel. This was sad as it was a nice older hotel which just needed a good housekeeper. Hopefully someone soon will notice and give it a little TLC. I will say that the complimentary breakfast was quite nice with a large variety of choices.
