<Content>Loved Pelayo! The hotel is in an excellent location, within walking distance to Las Ramblas, but far enough away from the maddening crowd. It is right around the corner from a ticket agency for day tours/bus tours. The lobby was small but the front desk clerk was friendly, answered questions, and was generally helpful. The room was large by European standards with a well appointed bathroom. There was also a t.v. and small refrigerator.I would definitely recommend the hotel for the price. By no means luxury but nice for the price!

<Content>Do not stay here Yes, this Hotel is a good location. However, the front desk could not even locate their own Hotel on a city map. The rooms are old, noise from the street is loud, and on top of everything they charged our credit card for the room twice. Overpriced and not worth it.

<Content>Average Great location, but that's about it. We were given room 105 (please refuse this one if given!) which is tiny double room with bathroom, right next to the reception. As the hotel works 24/7, on the first night we didn't get any sleep as it felt like we were sleeping right at the reception - the noise of people coming, leaving and chatting was awful. the night after we slept better, mainly because we were so knackered. but after that had asked for different room, as our original room had very smelly bathroom - the drain-smell was horrible, had to keep the door shut at all time. breakfast - for 90euros we could do with fresh coffee and normal pastries and some place to sit - forget about that one. Eventually we were moved to bigger room (215) and got some decent sleep. would not recomened and would not stay again.

<Content>Decent but a bit ghetto Its hard to explain this hotel. On one hand, the room was big, the staff was nice and they cleaned it well. On the other hand the ghetto entry way, staircase/elevator and all around hostel feel will leave you wondering why this is costing you a 100 bucks a night. But if youre used to having your dollar not go very far in Europe and you are not looking to stay at an elegant hotel then this place may be right for you.Conclusion: It was nice but no frills. If youre willing to spend a 100 a night on no frills, then definitely go for it.

<Content>Only OK My sister, my boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Pelayo in September 2005. We paid 100euros/night for a triple with shower and breakfast was included. It was raining when we first arrived in Barcelona and there was another hotel with a very similar name (though I can't remember it off the top of my head) on the same street. We accidently went there initially - but were redirected to the right place. To get to the reception of the hotel you have to be buzzered into the actual building - it looks like there are about 3 or 4 other business there. Then its up a flight of stairs to the lift, then on the first floor is the reception area - again you need to buzzer in.Pros- our room had a balcony - looking at the floor plan i think its the only room there with a balcony.- location location location! right near placa catalunya and near 2 underground stations- huge roomCons- initial problems when checking in despite me having an emailed confirmation; this was sorted out fairly quickly though (they thought i had booked for a double and not a triple)- initial problems with the toilet - it wasn't flushing - again quickly sorted out when brought to the attention of the staff.Other points worth mentioning:- breakfast consists of a hot drink from an automated machine and packaged pastries. there is no place to eat it really so we took it back to our room.I would stay here again, though only if other places of similar price were unavailable.

<Content>Pelayo was good Again, I write my comments as a group leader.We arrived at Hotel Pelayo after five days of high action touring, which started in Madrid. Prior to our arrival, I knew little more than the location of the Hotel Pelayo - in the heart of the city near Plaza Catalu帽a. I had contact via internet with a couple from Barcelona who owned a business near Plaza Catalu帽a. They were not familiar with the Pelayo Hotel and were unable to give me any details about what to expect.It was really a very nice hotel. Not upscale and luxurious in modern sense, but it was very low key and comfortable. Our room was dark, we had a view of a non-descript court yard. Another room within our group had a view of the street below with an opened balcony. That was a very nice extra.The dining area was in the basement. We were served sit down dinners and buffet breakfast. The foods seemed a little too much like food from home, example: mashed potatoes served with what we would consider to be breakfast sausage. Some members of our group opted to pay to eat outside the hotel just to get a sample of the local cuisine.We enjoyed the little lobbies on each floor. The kids sat there and talked while taking a break. They also sat in the basement lobby, perhaps it was a bar area. There they had a birthday party with cake for one of our girls.We were seldom aware of other occupants of this hotel. We ate at preassigned intervals, we seldom saw other occupants in the hallways and lobbies. Perhaps we saw others at the front desk, but it was a very small entrance and front desk and one only saw a very few people.I / We were happily satisfied with our stay at the Pelayo Hotel.

<Content>Average The location is great, but the room is average. The staff don't speak much English and are not as helpful. I can't even get directions to the Gerona Airport. Breakfast include coffee or tea from a machine and selections of individually wrapped biscuits or cakes.

<Content>Great location but not a great hotel Hotel Pelayo is in an excellent location right next to Placa de Catalunya, but the highlights stop there.To me it seemed more like a hostel than a hotel as you have to press a buzzer to be let in (day or night). Once inside you then make your way up (stairs or lift) to the reception, which you must again buzz before getting let in. The building itself is shared with one or two other businesses.We didn't get off to the best start as they couldn't find our booking details, but this was soon resolved. Our twin room (114) didn't have the best view as it simply faced the less than appealing courtyard. It was clean an equipped even if not very spacious and a bit dated.Breakfast was included in the price, but we decided to give it a miss and so have no idea what it comprised.Upon checking out we were presented with an incorrect bill for 900+ Euros, which apparently was a bill for a different room altogether. So that was administrative errors on both our arrival and departure.For a 2 star hotel it was just about what you would expect, but at 90 Euros per night I'd rather have spent an extra 20 Euros per night to stay at the 4 star Gallery Hotel (pure heaven by comparison), or even saved money and booked into one of the many seafront hostels which are great value and of similar quality to Hotel Pelayo.
