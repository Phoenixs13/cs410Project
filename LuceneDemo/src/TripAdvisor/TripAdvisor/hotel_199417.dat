<Content>Twin Toddlers in Berlin My wife and I booked this hotel, with very specific requirements in mind. travelling with 14 month old twins, are priority was for a hotel providing family friendly rooms, in a quiet, but central location.This hotel ticked all the boxes, and more. Our room was perfect, very clean, and designed well, allowing us to make use of a partition to allow us to relax,in fornt of the TV, when the children went to their cots.The cots and furnishing supplied were all great, and excellent double-glazing meant that whilst the hotel, is bang centre of a main street, there was no traffic noise, at all.The highlight for our daughter was the beautifully designed breakfast room. Bright and airy, this room presented a really nice way to kick off your day. We found the breakfast great for adults and babies alike, and never left hungry. The waitress staff, were all fantastic with our children, making them feel really special.One thing which really impressed me was the security in the hotel. Swipe cards had to be used to access the front/corridor and room doors, not that I felt particularly intimidated at any time, but it's worth mentioning if you are travelling on your own.My only criticism was with the hotel's housekeeping and reception staff. We asked for replacement coffee and spare nappies (which the hotel says they can provide on their web-site) and the coffee never arrived, and they had no nappies left. We asked about train times to the airport, and the details supplied were wrong, which meant we missed the train we鈥檇 like to have caught, and ended up with a lot of clock watching as set on the later train, airport bound鈥ot the ideal way to end a holiday when you鈥檝e toddlers in tow.All in all we were happy enough with our experience, that on our next visit to this great city, we'll be staying in the same hotel again.

<Content>Great hotel which can not fault!!! Me and my wife spent our Easter Weekend in Berlin, and finding a hotel was somewhat hard as most places wanted 150 euros a night and this place offered a double room at 110 euros a night, which is slightly above my budget, but was well worth it!!!!First the location is excellent! Got off the train at the Zoo train station after getting the train from the airport... short walk down to the Europa Centre and there is the hotel just round the corner (word of warning... the hotel staff tell you the entrence is next to Pizza Hut, but it is down a small ally way, so if you do not pay attention, you can easilly miss it once you reach Pizza hut.Once in the hotel, the staff were really helpful,and the hotel is one of the safest I have been in... your key card gets you through about 2 doors before you reach your room!!!!As for the rooms.... WOW!!!! My appartment is smaller than these rooms :-) and a nice big double bed + a single camp bed in the corner... no idea why.Only problem with the rooms is the bathroom :-( The hotel seems to be VERY eco-friendly, and you have to turn the water all yourself and turn the hot water on yourself also, which we were not told about till 2nd day, so we had NO HOT SHOWERS!!! and when we did, it was hot for about 1 minute :-(Also, there really should be a shower mat in the bath, as on the 2nd night my wife slipped and hit her head, and when I went to reception to get ice, was told they had none, so had to go down to Pizza hut and get some for myself! :-(Apart from that, the hotel is in one of my top 5 :-)Beakfast could use a little imagination!!! My wife was over the moon that they gave Salmon EVERY morning, but for us non-fish eatters, a few slices of cheese and ham is about all there is :-( nothing in the way of a warm meaty breakfast which I am use too!All in all, a really good find of a hotel with an excellent location and really good price which I will stay in again :-)

<Content>Very nice and quiet in the center of the city Booked a single room for 4 days during FruitLogistika trade show. Very good location on Ku-Dam district 鈥?shopping, restaurants, city tours all nearby. The personnel was very friendly and helpful with directions. Room was spacious, clean with new furniture. Breakfast buffet was very good too, especially if you compare it to the same price hotels in Paris or London 鈥?there you will get only toasts, eggs and coffee for the same money.Metro station was within 5 minutes walk, and a bus from the trade show in the evening stopped near hotel. I visited couple of other hotels in the city. The amenities in 4 star hotels were similar to Berliner- Hof, but the location was much further from the center, and the price was higher. I would definitely recommend Berliner Hof as a good value, safe and quiet place in Berlin. ElenaCanada

<Content>Centrally located, good value hotel This is a midprice hotel in a convenient central Berlin location. You wont get a lovely view to admire from your balcony, but don't be put off by the unglamorous surroundings: once you get inside, the hotel is just fine, with clean rooms and comfy beds; the usual continental style breakfast and pleasant helpful staff. This place does what you want without breaking the bank.

<Content>Does exactly what it says on the can...... Stayed at the Berliner Hof, Tauzienstrasser, Berlin in Early Dec 2005.This hotel forms part of the Europa Center in the former West of Berlin very near to Zoo U Bahn and S Bahn Stations.Firstly must comment on the hotel entrance-DO NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. It is literally steps away from one of Berlin's main streets Tauzienstrasse and couldn't be more centrally placed for shops, nightlife, restauarants and transport links etc. Saying this however the access point is via a narrow shopping arcade adjacent to Pizza Hut which doesn't look very thrilling. The entrance looks very sparse and bland but the lift takes you straight to the main reception on an upper floor and once there the hotel is an absolute pleasure....Very sleek and modern, clean lines, quality furnishing, impeccably clean and staff are all very pleasant and welcoming.Breakfast is served on the top floor in a superb breakfast room which was a joy to dine in. So clean and modern, staff replenish buffet speedily. Excellent choice and variety, modern furniture, very reminiscent of IKEA or Radisson SAS at altogether realistic prices for a Capital City Centre hotel.We've stayed in other Berlin hotels over seven years which were equally as conformtable but the room rates per night were far more- hence the Berliner Hof was a gem at a fair price.Have recommended to others and would certainly stay there again

<Content>Berliner Hof The guidebook quoted on TripAdvisor calls the entrance to the hotel discreet; I would call itdingy, strewn with debris. But the room was fairly nice and clean yet smallish.The location is one of its attractions: right in the middle of good shopping (Ka De We, etc.) and near the Gedaechtniskirche. Bahnhof Zoo is withing walking distance.
