<Content>The nightmare! The hotel staff were absolutly insolent. The room that we got hadn't got window. There were impossible to smoke there and the bed was covered with disposable (!) sheets and blankets. There were children shouting all the night and all about that hotel like a nightmare. The most horrible thing was absence of bath and shower. And wash basin was very-very small. If you want to feel yourself like in prison - you can choose this hotel.Thnks God we slept there only 1 night and were glad to escape that place.ps We were so shoked after all that even didn't make any fotos of this hotel.

<Content>Hmm..... We expected a lower standard here as we stayed during the first night Grand Prix and more central hotel prices were going through the roof, having stayed more centrally just off Orchard Rd for the first part of our stay venturing to this part of town was quite a contrast - not only the hotel but the lack of clean, pleasant surroundings of the city centre.We checked in and were told as we had booked a standard room we had no windows! it smelt decidedly smokey and the bathroom was a damp wetroom - when you shower everything gets wet. We asked whether there were upgraded rooms available and what the difference was - it just a window so we stayed with what we had but were offered any number of rooms until we were happy with the smell! 2nd room was a bit better, however the lack of windows and virtually non existent extractor fan meant the bathroom was pretty damp - hence the general smell of the hotel.To be fair, the rooms were clean (except for the bathroom damp), however we were not keen on the disposable pillow cases that were provided and some inability to make the beds properly (bottom sheet with about 2 foot spare at the top but plastic of matress uncovered at bottom). TV was provided and one of the rooms we saw had a DVD. No fridge or space, just a bed and one side table, no room to swing a cat! Air con seemed to reset itself to 26degrees everytime you left the room and walls are pretty thin. Lavender MRT was fairly close by.Ultimately, if you don't have to stay here I wouldn't but if you're looking for a real budget option and are not too fussy of your surroundings, it'll do.

<Content>Thank Heavens Singapore is a safe country Before you confirm your booking to this hotel, try to exhaust all other possibilities. Located on 30 Foch Road, this hotel bordering on motel/hostel was not a happy place to return to after a day of sight-seeing and shopping. My friend and I dreaded going back to it - but since we were blessed with a great sense of humor, we soon learned to laugh off its shortcomings. Tip 1 : if you take a cab from the airport, tell the cab driver that hotel 81 elegance is near the Lavender Food Court. Tip 2: Bring your own towels. Tip 3: Request for a room with a window. Negative Side: The location looked a bit dodgy. As my friend and I were both females, we were a bit scared of the area especially since it was our first time in Singapore. From travel guides and travel websites and plain hearsay, we gathered that Singapore was a litter-free and very clean city -- this area disproved that. There were scary-looking folks and massage parlors all over the area. Staff was inconsistent - we'd ask them to call a cab for us from time to time, sometimes the person at the reception would say okay and call one for us while at other times, they'd tell us to hail one from outside the hotel. Strange. The rooms are very very small. Our jaws fell to the uncarpeted floor when we saw the size of the rooms. We could barely move. There was hardly any room for our luggage. The wall was literally one step away from the bed. And to add insult to injury, we were given a room WITHOUT WINDOWS. Talk about claustrophobia. The rooms are obviously not well maintained. There was a crack on the bathroom door and mould on the bathroom tiles. The floor felt dirty and un-swept. The shower area and the toilet have NO PARTITION so schedule your bathroom breaks and shower times wisely! Good thing the place didn't flood. There is a drain on one part of the floor beside the toilet bowl where the shower water goes. Needless to say, the bathroom was always a wet mess after we bathed.The hotel has a very different idea of 'cleaning'. I think their idea of cleaning is making up the bed and maybe wiping up the bathroom floor. My friend and I wanted to see if they really cleaned the room so we'd leave wadded tissue paper under the bed, partially hidden but still obvious. We came back to the hotel and the wadded tissue paper was still there. Other guests were very noisy. In the middle of the afternoon, another guest on our floor decided to blast Crank That Soulja Boy from his/her stereo. This was followed by shouting and door-banging and lots of complaining. Only one electrical socket!No smoking rooms. Nearest MRT station: Farrer Park or Little India.Positive Side:The staff were pretty helpful when it came to booking tours for us. Free candy by the reception. Free water in the room. Hair dryer. The hawkers beside the hotel had pretty good food. Try the Pink Guava and White Fungus drink. Cheers (a convenience store) and 7-11 beside hotel. Bus stop right in front of the hotel - except only or two of the buses that stopped there passed along tourist-friendly routes.

<Content>Cheap but probably best to give it a miss Unfortunately we visited Singapore during an Expo and most of the mid range hotels had bumped up their prices so they were out of our price range.Singapore seems to lack a good stock of budget hotels. We paid around 拢50 direct to stay at the Hotel 81. They are a chain and we chose this one as it was supposed to be their newest property.Location wise it was just 5 minutes walk from two metro stations, which are cheap and easy to use. It's saving grace was its location (opposite) the Lavender Street Food Market where we ate most nights. However, the room was pokey and we had to upgrade to get a window. There was no room to put bags although it was generally clean, the linen and towels were changed everyday and water was restocked.The most iritating thing was the noise - it travelled and it was difficult to sleep with the housekeeping staff (and other guests) banging and crashing outside at all hours. Reception were also not the most helpful. Their abilities only seemed to stretch to ordering a taxi and charging my credit card.It seems you have to be willing to pay much more to stay at a decent hotel in Singapore.
