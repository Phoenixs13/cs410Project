<Content>Loved the location We have just returned from a stay in Hotel Suizo and I Really enjoyed my stay there! I was very apprenhensive before staying there due to the reviews I read but I was plesantly surprised!!! My boyfriend and I were like to kids at christmas waiting to hear what floor we were on because of the reviews we read about the top floor rooms.We ended up on the third floor and first impressions were very pleasant. The room and bathroom were spotless and there were nice little goodies such as a mini sewing kit, Shoe shine and a comb ( which I ended up using for the whole holiday @bag friendly :) ) Our room was on the left hand side of the hotel facing onto other windows which did not bother me atal!!I found the staff helpful and friendly!It was really close to all the main attractions and i recommend taking a walk down to Port Vell as it is stunning and there is just a great atmosphere down there!! The rambla is also less than a 5 minite walk away! Also the metro stop is directly outside the door! From the airport you should get a return bus ticket to placa de catalunya and from there get the red metro to uriquonao (cant spell) and swop there to the yellow metro to jaume1! We also got the tour bus (bus touristic) which was 26euro for 2 days and it was well worth every penny and in the evening we would get the red bus which stops off near hotel suizo to freshen up to go for a meal!!WATCH OUT for young spanish people coming up to you in groups of 3 or 5 who will pretend to be collecting for handicapped people while they pick pocket you!! I nearly got caught in this trap as they would crowd around you!!Finally enjoy your holiday as barcelona is a gorgeous city to visit and I would definately recommend Hotel Suizo especially for people on a budget!! Its perfect!

<Content>Hated the Hotel, Loved the Area Although the hotel is in a great location, I would NOT recommend staying here. Not only is the hotel very old, but the rooms are pretty terrible - they're either too small with no windows or they have no working AC if they have a balcony. The staff was unresponsive to problems we had and overall just unhelpful and rude. For a future trip to Barcelona, I would be happy to pay a bit more to stay anywhere better!

<Content>For a free upgrade.... We were actually booked to stay at the Santa Marta Hotel (a 2Star owned by the same company) but when we got there we were told there was a problem with the water and would have to stay in the Suizo instead at no extra cost.The hotel overall was decent enough but we were put in a room at the top on the fifth floor which only had one small skylight that didnt open - this made the room very hot and quite dark. The air-conditioning just pumped out heat! However we weren't about to complain as it was better than where we had booked to originally.You do have to cross the street to have breakfast at the Hotel Gotico but as this a 4star it was very nice indeed. The staff were very friendly and helpful and most could speak good English.

<Content>Very pleasant stay We got a great deal with this hotel and after reading the reviews I was a bit nervous but it was a really pleasant experience. the hotel is situated less than 5 mins from la ramblas and the port area.Our room was old fashioned enough but with all the trimmings you would expect a tv, phone, mini bar, safe, hair dry and nice bath with powerful shower. The beds were really comfy and we had a balcony that looked onto a busy street.I would say if you have children this is not the hotel for you as its very noisy at night . Barcelona enjoys a rather particular reputation for its night life.there are many small cafes and boutiques nearby but dont eat in cappacino cafe chain they charged us 11 euros for two cheese sandwiches and two cokes. for good value and a safe central location this is a great place to stay

<Content>Bad hotel, good location Pros:- Great location, 10-minute walk to Las Ramblas, literally one step outside the metro stop.- Nice view, we had a corner room with three floor-to-ceiling window-doors that opened into small balconies. We paid the cheapest price that we could find (75 euro) and didn't request it or anything.Cons:- Requested a double bed, the best they could do was push two single beds together.- Hot water in shower went from normal to scorching hot... every 6 seconds or so. It was like clockwork.- Heater in room did not work.- Staff was borderline rude. I have never been to a hotel where every single employee I talked to made me feel like they hated being there and didn't want me to be there either.The quality of the room was vastly better than a hostel, but overall the experience was incredibly disappointing compared to other hotels.I would only recommend this to someone who is deciding between this or a hostel. I have stayed in some hostels in Barcelona, and this was a little bit better, for a comparable price if you have 2 or 3 people.To get to the hotel from the airport, I followed a previous Tripadvisor's post, it was very easy:Take the Blue city bus from the airport to the Placa Catalunya. It cost around 3.50 euro per person. The Placa Catalunya is the first stop on the bus, and the driver didn't call it out or anything, so be ready to get off.Take the Metro to the Jaume I stop, it is on the yellow L4 line.It is literally right outside the metro stop.

<Content>An OK hotel at an very good price We won some free flights to Barcelona, but had to go just before Christmas and book at somewhere cheapish at short notice. Suizo came up on a web search as having rooms available - easily the cheapest 3-star, so we booked it with some trepidation.We needn't have worried. It was fine for a cheap 3-night break.Plus points:- Almost perfect location. 5 mins from Ramblas, Cathedral, Christmas market, Little alleys with shops restaurants etc.- Clean. Friendly staff. I think we got the room in the photo on the website, so it was what we expected!Minus points:- Noisy at night. To be expected given the location, but double glazing would have helped

<Content>Great location but top floor rooms are bad. We got two rooms in the top floor, which is basically the loft.The rooms were very uncomfortable, very hot even in October.No ventilation and virtually no natural light.Even the room lights were so dim, one could not read anything.We paid a good price for 2 nights for 2 rooms and the hotel would not even change the rooms when we explained how uncomfortable it was.Otherwise, in terms of location, its tops. Very near everything and great choice of good places to eat.The passages, bathroom (though small and outdated), common areas, lift etc were all good.This is one hotel where we will think twice if we wanted to stay when we visit Barcelona again.

<Content>in our opinion ... The 2 good things about this hotel were its location - its central to access transport and walking distance from most attractions; also the room was very clean. However, most of the pictures on info sites bear no resemblance to the rooms we had (a party of 4 in 2 rooms). We were on the 5th floor with rooflights that let in little light. The aircon in both was noisy and ineffectual - our room's air-con dripped water onto the parquet flooring which was warped and stained. Both rooms bathrooms had old chipped enamel baths with rusty shower fittings above them. There were no tea/coffee facilities in the rooms and the tv's didnt work. The safe in 1 room was broken which they promised to fix but didnt. They offered to look after passports etc in the front desk safe, but would not hold our money. The rooms were very noisy even with the rooflights closed - the rubbish truck comes at 2am - and the Cathedral (just a few metres from the hotel) rings a bell every quarter hour with another chiming the whole hours (eg 8 tolls at 8 o'clock) day and night. There are no breakfast facilities unless you go up the road to a sister hotel at extra cost and the food is rubbish. We wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you are extremely hard of hearing and can't find anything else in Barcelona.

<Content>Good placed and clean hotel My wife and me ( around 30 years old both of us ) stayed there for 3 nights.It got all you expect from 3-stars hotel.Clean room and bathroom, but air-conditioner in the room wasn't working. We were offered another room ( but only for 2 last nights since the hotel was full ). You have to close the windows at night because of noise.There is metro station 20meter from the entrance to hotel and a few coffee shops. Generally it's placed close to big street so you got all kinds of noise that can be tolerated ( and one can get a fair sleep ) only when room's windows are closed.Breakfast ( given in hotel 40m from SUIZO ) is very good. especially choice of hams.I found no parking ( but wasn't looking very close because we rented car only after check-out ), but if you need taxi - hotel staff menage it very fast and the car can get right to the entrance - it's handy when you have a heavy luggage.Do not forget that you stay in Suizo in order to explore the wonderfully pretty Barcelona and when you came back to hotel - they have all you need - clean bed and breakfast next morning.The hotel is in a very good location for exploring the city - metro station is next to entrance and RAMBLA, Port and other things are in 500 or so meters from there.We went to see a local dance show in Music House ( nice red house around 250 meters from there ) but didn't like it - it was tourist show and 60euro for 2 people wasn't worth it.The staff was Ok and always ready to help.So - if you came to explore Barcelona - Suizo is a good choice.

<Content>Great location...takes a couple of nights to sleep ! The Suizo is in a fantastic location, the entrance to Jaume tube station is quite literally 15 feet outside the Hotel entrance, La Ramblas is a five minute walk up the street by the hotel (either side) the marina is a five minute walk out the entrance and turn right.The hotel was clean and comfy, the only English channel on the TV was some BBC channel (can't recall which as it was a year ago since we went) which basically repeated the same programmes over and over (documentaries / news etc.) but...you don't go to Barcelona to watch TV. Our room was at the front of the hotel, more or less central, two floors up, great for people watching! The only downside was that due to the single glazing the noise outside was very noticeable and it took me a couple of nights before I got a full nights sleep, but you get what you pay for and we didn't pay a lot (don't take that the wrong way, the hotel is great!)The staff were very helpful and friendly, especially taking into account our very poor Spanish, their English was much better! Next door to the hotel is a pastry shop selling all sorts of delicious pastries and other bits'n' bobs, just the place if you like a sweet breakfast! All in all, if you are on a budget ( not sure what the prices are like in season) this is a great, well located, basic but comfy hotel and I'd recommend it. (I'm going to read everyone elses reviews now to see if they agree!!

<Content>Fantastic Location - Good Price This hotel is in a great location! Walking distance to the Cathedral, the gothic quarter, la ramba, and a 15 min walk to the peir at barcelonetta. The metro station is literally 10 steps from the front door of the hotel. Rooms are clean and adequate - what you would expect for the price.Can be quite noisy at night as right in the centre, we slept through it though so not a problem.Would defintely recommend this hotel, especially if you are away for the weekend and won't be spending much time at the hotel.

<Content>Great Location We stayed in this nice, quaint hotel for two nights. Our room was clean and a decent size with a huge wrap around balcany. The location was fantastic, right in front of a metro station and only a five minute walk to La Rambla. We were on a tight budget and I thought the hotel was perfect for what we paid for it!

<Content>good location This hotel is ideally located in the gothic quarter. It is close to some interesting small shops, and is a short walk from the Barcelona Cathedral and Plaza Catalunya. Unfortunately the room itself left a lot to be desired. It was incredibly stuffy, with a musty damp smell to it, and although I managed to open the ceiling window, I couldn't get any fresh air in. When the bellboy came to try and turn on the air conditioning at my request, there was no control pad to be found anywhere in the room. I had to swelter all night long, and I was so glad to check out in the morning, just to breathe some fresh air. The photos posted of the hotel rooms, were no reflection at all of the room I stayed in!

<Content>Terrible Place! A friend of mine wanted to come to Barcelona and I recommended this hotel based on its location and its lobby. But the room was terrible: dirty, smelly, ugly and small. I've seen best hotels (at a third of the price) in the worst neighbourhoods of Fez, Morocco, or in Argentina. This people of Hotel Suizo keep scamming people who come to Barcelona. I wonder how they got the 3-star rating or who they bribe to do it. Stay away from this hotel unless you want to have a terror vacation.

<Content>Worst Hotel Ever I booked this hotel on the recommendation of a friend who lives nearby and thought the hotel lobby looked decent. Indeed, the lobby looked just fine. The room, however, was atrocious. One small, dirty window on the slanted ceiling the shade of which would not budge. Despite having no real window and being on the top (5th) floor, the street noise, including shouting, garbage trucks and breaking glass, continued throughout the night. In addition, there was a noise something like an electronic buzzing (imagine your neighbor vacuuming in short bursts) every three to seven seconds (I counted) ALL night long. I did not sleep a wink in this hotel. The shower, well, rust stains don't even begin to describe. I stayed one night. Upon checking out, the bilingual desk clerk could not work my credit card and could only bark out the words you pay cash! When I inquired how to get a taxi he told me it would take 1/2 hour. His colleague overheard and called one which arrived in slightly less than two minutes. Despicable hotel. Wish I could put a sign on the door to warn potential guests to run, run away.

<Content>Would not recommend it!!! The Hotel Suizo is old and dirty. The rooms smell terrible, the TV is small and old. The breakfast is accross the street in another hotel and it is not good. The staff is average, the only friendly staff member was Luis who works the night shift. The good thing is that we did not stay in the room long because we were sight seeing the whole day. The only good thing is that it is located in the heart of Barrio Gotico and a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas. Next time I will choose a Hotel on Las Ramblas.

<Content>Don't waste your money We stayed in several hotels in Spain... this hotel is horrible. Small room with old cricket bad with bad mattress, pre-historical TV with no English channels and it smells like public restroom as soon as you turn conditioner on ( at the same time you can鈥檛 open window because of noise level). The only good thing about it is location. We would never recommend this hotel to our friends.

<Content>Excellent!!!!! This hotel is actually a chain of 3 all within 1 block of each other. This is listed as a 2 star, but the ammenities are more like 3-4 stars. The staff is very nice and very helpful, the rooms are sound proof, and the bathroom is all in marble and spacious! Excellent hote - a great price for the room!!!!

<Content>easy to find for first timers Great location in the Barri Gotic area. The Suizo is a great find for a moderate price. About five steps from the front doors is an entrance to the underground rail, but if walking, the hotel is quite easy to find. From the airport, take the BLUE city bus (inexpensive airport transfer - buy tickets on the bus) to Paca de Catalunya. The hotel is about a ten minute walk towards the marina. The Marina Port Vell itself, is only about another ten minute walk from the hotel. The room was very clean with wood floors and a high ceiling, but not coffee. The bathroom was surprisingly large which included a tub and two sinks (unusual for some economical European hotels). You'll need to insert your room key into the card slot by the door (inside the room of coarse) to use the electric power. The hotel has this thing about conserving energy. All the lights in the hallways are on motion detectors and only come on during any movement - kind of weird.If you're the adventurous type, the hotel is within walking distance to most of the really great sights including the La Rambla.Check out mapeasy for a really cool map of Barcelona and some other places.

<Content>Good, centrally located hotel Hotel Suizo may be the perfect hotel for you depending on what you're looking for. If you want to be in the heart of the action, stay up late, and spend less than $100 a night, its for you. If you are more of a daytime tourist, or you aren't used to small european-style hotel rooms you may want to look in another part of the city or spend more money. Front desk service is helpful and english-speaking.

<Content>Awful I stayed in the suizo about 3 years ago, never again. When we arrived our room was not ready, as we sat waiting for the room to become availible a woman came out the lift arguing with the porter about the way she and her family had been treated by the hotel and its staff. The receptionist turned his back and shrugged.Our first room flooded when the air conditioning was switched on. The second room had one window in the ceiling and the shower would only work by holding the shower head below ones knee. The third room was very nice and once again when the air conditioning was put on water came from the ceiling. The fourth room (this is all in the space of 24 hours) was ok, but i noticed all the fire prevention doors were padlocked open. We asked for our money back and were refused, we contacted the hotel chain and heard nothing from them and we were charged for the use of a safe for our stay - which could have been waived as a gesture of good faith. Was in Barcelona last year and see it has been done up, but DON'T GO!

<Content>Ok, not great... We found the Suizo ok, not great. The location was good, right near the Cathedral and the Barrio Gotic, but the rooms left something to be desired: they seemed cramped and just as importantly dark, which I didn't expect, as the hotel had recently been refurbished. Also, the lights in the hallway were on motion detectors. Although I understand the desire to save energy, I disliked having the hallway go dark behind me as I walked to the elevator, and one night I stood in the hallway, waiting for my husband, and the lights went out on me - I guess I hadn't moved enough. Its a little thing but it made the visit less pleasant. The staff was perfunctory.

<Content>good hotel! We stayed here from 17-21 february and had a very good time. Reception staff was efficient en helpful and the rooms were nice en clean. Of course if you stay in this central location you have some noise from cars en people passing under your window. I must say however that this didn't bother us too much since we were really tired by the time we got back to the hotel.We had our breakfast included and it was served in another hotel across the street. It was not even a minute's walk so that was no problem and the quality was good. The hotel has been refurbished last year and that shows, it looks very well kept. Please don't bother about the negative comments from people who stayed long time ago, just go and enjoy!
