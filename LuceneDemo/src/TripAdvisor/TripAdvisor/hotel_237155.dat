<Content>Smelly and Noisy, dont stay here I am a backpacker so I am used to basic cheap accommodation and usually use hostels but this time I came with my boyfriend so I chose a hotel. There is nothing we liked about this hotel and wish I had paid extra for someting better. The reception staff were not friendly. They didnt speak to us at all and they had no leaflets for information on the area as you would expect in a hotel. Our room was quite unpleasant with a tiny window that looked out onto another wall which was nothing but a tiny gap. It smelled quite bad of sewers which made us feel quite queasy.Worst of all was the noise. The walls are paper thin. When our neighbours decided to have a shower at 4am it might as well have been in our own room! It was so loud. We could also hear their conversations and lots of coughing through the night. The location was good in that it was so close to Ramblas but terrible trying to find the hotel when we got there, and as its up a narrow dark alleyway, I was very frightened and on our last night people attempted to pickpocket us 3 times!  If you are looking for budget accomodation like I was, dont stay here! Im sure a hostal would have been much friendlier, less smelly and safer.

<Content>Cheap but under average hotel We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and didn't enjoy it at all. The room is tiny and smelly, with an inside window that can not be opened because of other people's smoking, and very thin walls (so that you can hear the conversations in the rooms next to you).The hotel is near to the historic center and La Ramblas, but with the great transportation system (including metro) in Barcelona, it is wiser to take better hotel, not so close to the center.

<Content>Great bargain central hotel Stayed at this hotel for a week (august- september 2008) having found it through a booking website at 60 euro per night for an ensuite double. was amazed to find something so cheap in the centre and to be honest its more a 1 plus or 2 minus than just a 1 star.Read all of the reviews prior to going and was expecting something awful - was worried about the size of room, the safe, the rude staff, the cleanliness etc etc but found none of them a problem. Size of room was not really an issue - with city centre hotel at that price you expect compact and it was bigger than we expected - ensuite and room were big enough for two people to move around and get ready etc with no problem. it wasnt like we spent hours in the room other than sleeping so not a problem.the safe we didnt use because of the warning on here but it looked like the standard model used in all the hotels where i've never had a problemthe staff worried me - even though we always treat staff well and dont expect the usual problems, we are a gay couple and the reports on the old guy here and others worried me - but they were all fabulous. They treated us with respect and smiles (the latter normally missing in spain :-)). the so called rude old guy chatted and joked with us a couple of times as well and so did the middle aged guy so i really cant see why other people have had problems - of course we did the usual things anyone would do lik elearning to say hello goodbye please and thank you in catalan rather than using english or spanish and i think that helped.in terms of cleanliness i cant see what the fuss was about - very clean with bedding and towels totally changed every day we were there. sure some of the fixtures and fittings were a bit dated but no prob we didnt have trouble with noise other than one morning when 2 of the cleaners woke us up (1030am so not too early) with a loud conversation and the electrical sockets are a problem in their number and location - one at ceiling height for a non existent tv and one in the bathroom - we had to improvise a shelf for our travel kettle but that was no prob - next time i go i'll take an extension leadOverall i would recommend this to other travellers and indeed already have. Next time we go we will use the same place without hesitation. Its very convenient for Liceu metro and the Ramblas Jaume metro and the cathedral. there are some great bars and restaurants within a 10 minute radius and its now added to my list of good clean value for money european city break hotels.I would also really really recommend it for gay travellers on a budget - rather than paying more for the hotels who advertise as gay friendly and charge for it, pick this one where the staff treat everyone with the same level of respect and friendliness as the guests give them .

<Content>Good value for money 4 nights in June. 1* hotel in the heart of the Gotic quarter - 3 minutes to Ramble.We reserved with bookassist web-site for 60Euro for night. The room was small but clean with free safe and bath ensuite.For this price it is the best value that you can find in the centre of Barcelona.

<Content>Nice location, good price, rude staff, not well organized I have been to this hotel recently. The location of the hotel is wonderful, right in the middle of the city. I booked the hotel online and called the hotel at night of my arrival. The hotel staff told me that there was no booking in my name!!! So I had to stay at some other place for the night as my flight arrived at 11 at night and the metro closes at 12. The next morning I went there asking for an explanation....my booking was simply not there...But the hotel staff gave me a room at the local rate and my girlfriend who lives in spain, was helping me out in translating ...the hotel staff started to say that my gf can't visit me for more than few minutes a day..otherwise I have to pay for double room....The hotel was clean and the good value for money because of the good location..The room had only one window, opening in the elevator shaft...and because of the extractor system the room badly stank of smoke...After my 1st night at that hotel, they told me that someone at the reception forgot to check the email containing my reservation that's why they didn't find my reservation on the first day.Apparantly there is only one guy who can check the email (they receive the online bookings via email) .They also told me that since they have found my booking now I have to pay at a different rate which is 6 euro more than the local rate.....I had no other option than paying them..The guys who sit at the reception desk after 10 o clock was quite unfriendly. The hotel main door is closed at night for security and you have to wait for someone to come and open the door. The guys who worked during that time were quite rude.

<Content>Very good choice I have read the reviews about Hotel Call and some of them seem that people has not travelled a lot鈥o you want to pay for a one star hotel and get 5 stars?...I have been in hotels of three stars where the mattress was much worse, where the window was facing a wall and where you could listen noises.In the Hotel Call you will not find luxury rooms but you have a correct room, with private bath and tub, always clean, free safe and helpful people.I was with my girlfriend (she already had been) and we were really well. The location is perfect, next to all the most interesting spots of the city.I have been employed at hotels at several countries and I can say to you that it is an excellent choice for the price, really honest.

<Content>Ideal central location. Like many other reviewers, read the reviews AFTER a friend booked it for us.We were very apprehensive.I printed out a map of the hotel's location and arranged our journey from Estacio du Nord (The bus station near Arc de Triomf metro.) by metro (Taxi is reasonable if you can find one that is free)We travelled to Jaume metro. Found the street leading to the Plaka Jaume and the very narrow street to the hotel very easily. (about 2030 at night)I think every spare blank wall in Barcelona has grafitti on it.Which is very sad. Major towns in England are the same.LIke most of the previous reviews my comments would match, rooms clean, beds, changed every day, clean towels, HOT water all the time. Toilet clean.The three men that manned the desk, were always helpful.I speak a little spanish so that went a long way. BUT even if you dont , shouldnt be a problem.Our room was on the third floor near the lift, which we rareley heard. Our small window faced a wall. NOt a problem as it made the room very peaceful and you wouldnt know you were in a very vibrant bustling city. Like a previous reviewer didnt know what the weather was like until we ventured out.I feel sorry for the 2004 person who had there safe robbed, but we had no problems. Its a coded safe, and you just have to remember your code.Warned about pickpockets etc, but you use your noddle, take a bun bag or a zipped bag., and place it in front of you.THe downsides we experienced were, there are NO plug points in the room ( we took a kettle and couldnt use it.) MIssed my early morning cuppa.I couldnt charge up my mobile phone either.The other ,was a fellow English guest waking the whole of the hotel cos he couldnt get into his room. Everyone I think in Barcelona knew his wifes name by the time he finished. Unfortunate for us on our 1st night. He left the same morning .I hasten to add the following 4 nights were peaceful.THe hotel is a few minutes walk from the Ramblas and Liceu Metro. where there are Lots of eating places all competing for customers, cheap and otherwise. So you pays your money and takes your choice.Every morning the streets surrounding the hotel are washed and hosed down. Rubbish is removed every night or early morning.Lots of major tourist sites of easy walking distance from the hotel.Small cafe round the corner for a nice cup of Cafe con Leche ot Te con Leche and snacks for breakfast.Metro multi ticket very cheap and covers a large area.Watch the days and times of opening of the sites you want to see.If you have booked a short stay you may miss an attraction you want to see because its not open the days you have booked. IE the Magic fountain at Mont Juic which is only on Thurs, FRi Sat and Sun.I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Suitable to stay for a visit to Barcelona We were two couples with one children each. At first, when we arrived in front of the hotel, we felt disappointed because it looks very old and the building is in ruins (a bit), but as we got into the hotel, that bad image completely faded. Its inside has been rebuilt, it has air conditioning, it's clean, quiet, the rooms are ok, although our windows were faced to a wall. It has a good location (near La Rambla, the Cathedral and the Liceu metro station). In La Rambla there are many cheap places to eat, like McDonald's, KFC, Pans, etc. To conclude, it's suitable for someone who is visiting Barcelona city.

<Content>Simple, Budget and Convenient Good location, and helpful people. We鈥檝e just returned from Barcelona. We stayed 5 nights at hotel Call and we like it. It鈥檚 a simple, budget hotel in old Jewish quarter, in walking distance to Barcelona Catedral, near Liceu Metro station and Las Rambas. We found negative review of this hotel before we booked the room, but we didn't have any problem at all. Day shift reception is a friendly young guy, while the night shift鈥檚 belong to an old guy who've never smiled, but they waited for our late arrival before midnight and helpful to us. The narrow alley in front looks a bit scary at night, but full with shops during day. We had a room away from elevator, and with window facing the alley, so we could see people going to work in the morning garbage collector at night. Our room is smallbasic, with one plug outlet just by the ceiling. Hot water is good enough for summer, but not sure for winter. Air con is working. The wall between rooms is thin, we heard our neighbor's activity every night. The hotel has left luggage service. Overall is good enough.

<Content>pleasant stay We went there for two nights, and had no problems at all, the staff was very friendly (even the one at night, he called a taxi at 5 in the morning for us). OK, the rooms are very minimalistic, some have just a tiny window, but everything is clean and tidy. The cleaning lady even folded my clothes : )A good budget hotel for a couple of nights. You'll need some adaptation if you're used to hotels with 2 or more stars.

<Content>What do you expect? Looked for and found something cheap and clean. 4 Nights in Barca. How much time do actually spend in the room? No need for TV but a kettle to make a cup of tea or coffe would be nice. Clean and tidy. No outside window but then no street noise either. Tiled floors and no carpeting meant noisy corridors but I have spent time in far noisier Hotels.Overall I would say good value. Experience would have been improved if the 'grumpy old man' had not been on the reception but small price to pay...... Would we go back? At the price and with its location I say yes.

<Content>Basic, clean, good value My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Call for three nights at the beginning of November. We were a bit concerned before we arrived because some of the reviews we had read were very negative. On arrival the man on reception appeared slightly cold but became much friendlier throughout our stay, he even helped me with my poor attempts at Spanish. Previous reviews explained that some rooms did not have an outside window and noise from the lift was disturbing. A few days before our trip we requested a room on the third floor away from the lift. Our room turned out to be fine, it was reasonably sized, basic and clean. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a budget sightseeing holiday. I felt safe here and would stay here again.

<Content>the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. arrived mid afternoon in october, on our first night, at about 2 am we had a blockage in the toilet, and water was all over the room, got another room, next morning i was asked to pay a bill, (we had booked for 4 nights) when i asked why and what it was for, it was for 2 rooms and 1 night, because of the faulty plumbing we had to use another room, he also told us we had to leave as our original room was out of use for 3 days( this was untrue as someone else was in by lunchtime) when i refused to pay the extra, he took a baseball bat from under the counter and actually threatened me with it. i insisted the police was called, by this time i realised i had my mobile stolen and 200 euros stolen from the safe, the police were no use, my girlfriend and me left and went to the 4 star hotel colon, which was excellent, the hotel call, only go there if you cant get any other place, this is the last resort, if anyone would like to get in touch, its gaudi1956@yahoo.co.uk.

<Content>beware single girls This hotel has an excelent location, is clean and cheap - everything me and my friend wanted, yes the walls are a bit thin but luckily for us is wasn't busy there in november so not too disturbing. I will just say beware for single girls travelling without a man as one of the staff seemed to get too friendly with me and my mate and at one point it did get serious and we had to complain - after that it was fine, but just to let people know.

<Content>Location is everything We spent 5 nights in early September. The first 2 nights were in a cramped room, with the lift shaft obscuring the window. The air con only operated in the evening and early morning. The room was clean and the bed linen was too. Towels are too small though!The price was fair and the concierge was helpful and polite. We were moved to a better room (as promised) after two nights, so we now had windows - overlooking minute courtyard space.You get what you pay for at this hotel. The rooms do have safes, which do work - but be careful to follow the instructions or you may not lock it properly.All in all a pleasant budget priced hotel conveniently placed for tourists.

<Content>Confused Well...I'm confused. My partner and I stayed at Hotel Call for four nights (13th - 17th July). I had read the previous reviews shortly before we went which left me a bit pessimistic. However, I found the room to be comfortable and very good value. The temperature was perfect, the towels present and correct and our sleep was never disturbed by noise, nor were our possessions tampered with. OK, the guy who works nights has a bit of an attitude but I imagine this is something to do with staying up all night to let revellers back in. We've also stayed at Call's sister hotel, 'Hotel Condal'. This was really nice and worth the extra 15 quid or so if you can stretch to it. I think Hotel Call is generally ok but it sounds as though it has a few personnel issues.

<Content>terrible, terrible hotel this hotel should not be reccommended for anyone! the staff were impolite, air conditioning non-existent and my single room was right next to the lift shaft hence i had no opening window or windows whatsoever! i have never ever been to such a poor hotel in my life and cannot understand anyone who thinks this hotel is anything other than a disgrace! i did complain about the air conditioning and was told it was on but knew it was not the case because the room temperature was well in excess of 100 f! the staff just laughed! i visit barcelona 5-6 times yearly and love the city but my 5 night stay totally!!! you have been well and truly warned!!!

<Content>bad choice I've been in the hotel call for four nights and all i can say is that, in spite of beeing a relatively clean hotel:- we listen all the smallest noise in the other rooms, (we almost could hear other people's breath);- We couldn't control the air conditioned in the room, means it was on or off depending on de reception's people. (one night we almost fronze) - And the worst of all was the reception people. There were some old man so unpleasant, rude, unpolite and disagreeable that we almost couln't belive it. Every time we arrived at the hotel, the reception man was wathing tv and seammed so annoying because of having to to arise himself of the sofa to give the key of the room. One day the cleaning staff forgot to leave us toilet paper, so we had to ask at the reception. I almost had to request for it, for he didn't seem to want to give it to me.The second time, the cleanig staff forgot to live us towels. When my friend went to ask for it, it was evening when we arrived to the hotel, the man said it could be delivered, only on the othar day. After my friend insist, he came to give us ONE towel!!! Only after he had insisted and told him that we were two persons and we were paying for the full services the man decided do give us the towels.We will neve come back again to that hotel, that is for sure!

<Content>Robbed Blind When I first arrived at the Hotel Call I thought 'perfect'. It was quiet and clean although basic (but I knew this before I booked). On the 2nd day we had all our money stolen from our safe. It was locked properly. A very similar experience to 'Warsaw, Poland' (see above).DO NOT STAY AT HOTEL CALL YOUR MONEY IS AT RISK.PLEASE GET IN TOUCH 'WARSAW, POLAND'. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE.

<Content>Great but THIN WALLS! I thought the Hotel Call was great, really cheap,perfect for someone who is not going to spend a lot of time in the hotel, but just wants somewhere cheap and central to sleep.Great location in the Barri Gotic,nice staff.The rooms had very thin walls though and we could hear goings-on in other rooms... but beside that, I had no complaints. I'd go back again.

<Content>Good location, cheap at half the price! Our rating is for cheap and cheerful accomodation, it is by no means a palace - but has a good rating for good value and location.My husband and I decided to stayin barcelona for our 1st wedding anniversary. We had never been before but was lucky to book Hotel Call as it has the perfect location for the city. It is off a pedestrian side street, just off of Las Ramblas, so was quiet yet, excellent for walking around the city. It was in the middle of Las Ramblas as well. It is a very very basic hotel, perfect for the traveller who wants cheap and clean accomodation. Our room had a safety deposit box which was very handy as we had heard that pickpockets and muggers were prevailent (although we did not experience this). The rooms are small with bathrooms, but clean and perfect for sleeping and getting ready in.If you like a plush hotel, this is not for you, but if you want somewhere to lay your head after exploring this fabulous city then I a would recommend Hotel Call.

<Content>Dishonest staff The safe in our room was opened and robbed during our stay. We locked it properly, but the reception has a universal code to open them all. Sp its quite obvious that the hotel staff likes to help themselves to your belongings. They then had the nerve to blame our neighbours.Thus, I would not recommend the place to anyone....

<Content>A comfortable stay at the Call I stayed at the Hotel Call from 7th-12th February 2004. The room was very clean (as was the hotel as a whole in fact) with a bed, toilet, shower, safe and telephone. Quite basic, but as this was all I needed it was ideal for the price.The lack of a proper window was quite weird, as I didn?t know what the weather was like each day until I got outside. Apparently, all single rooms in the Hotel Call are like this. Instead there was an interior window that opened out onto a shaft which led up to the roof. This may be useful for some cool air in the summer, although the air conditioning did its job fine in February!The hotel was surprisingly noisy. I couldn?t here any noise from the streets, but I could clearly hear lots of noise from the floor that I was on, e.g. people talking, footsteps and doors closing. It seemed like the walls were paper-thin.The Hotel is in the middle of the Barri Gotic area, a perfect location for the bars, cafes, restaurants, shops and historic buildings in that area, although the streets around there are quite dark and narrow.Benito and his staff were very friendly and spoke good English. There was someone at reception 24 hours a day, which was useful when I got back late at night.Barcelona is a fantastic city. If you get the chance, go, and if you?re travelling on a budget and don?t need the luxuries that other hotels will charge you extra for, I recommend the Hotel Call.

<Content>If all you want is a place to lay your head this is the hotel for you There are many good things about this hotel , the location is excellent , the rooms are spotlessly clean, its is very reasonably priced and it has all the basics you need for a weekend. However.... there are no views from the windows making it feel very claustrophobic , when the people in the next room use the loo it sounds like they are in your bathroom and there is no pressure in the taps. If the only thing you really do want is a bed to sleep in then this is the hotel for you.

<Content>Excellent Location, spotlessly clean, good price I wanted to be near the shops, beach and town centre. And I had all of them within walking distance. It was so clean, I could not find fault. There was no outlook from the window, but that did not bother me as I only wanted a room to sleep in and shower. There was also a free safe in the room.

<Content>Call in at the 'Call' for an accessable stay in Barcelona We booked this hotel because it was one of the only places that we could book due to it being Colombus weekend, and everywhere we loked at was full. The hotel is situated up a small side street amongst a labyrinth of small, charming little streets behind the Gothic Cathedral. The hotel rooms are pleasantly decorated, and comfortable, many have a window which overlooks the street, which isn't noisy late at night. The bathroom was fine, the shower had consistantly hot water which was a bonus. There's nothing worse than running out of hot water! The sheets were changed daily which was good, and the room kept neat and tidy. There is a safe in the hotel room. This was easy to use, and an extra we found very beneficial. Barcelona has a lot of beggars and pick pockets, so it's a good idea to take enough cash out for the day and leave the rest safely put away. There is a neon hotel sign which is a great help late at night wondering round the streets trying to find it!! Make sure you get a landmark close by to head for because all the streets look the same in the early hours! It's about a 6 min walk from Liceu station, and is in a great position to get to most of the centrally situated museums, churches and other places of interest. Restaurants, bars, discos and bustling squares for eating whilst people watching are within a few minutes walk, as is the Ramblas. There is a 24hour receptionist who is friendly enough, but looks slightly startled at being woken at 5am!! A good place to stay, reasonably priced (we paid 拢22 each for a twin room)and a place I would reccommend to friends who were visiting the city, and somewhere I would go back to on my next visit.
