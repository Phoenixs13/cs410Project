<Content>Great villa on a great little island This was the perfect start to our Honeymoon. We spent three days and two nights on the charming island of Culebra. Our friends had honeymooned at this property and highly recommended it. Our large one-room villa had a small porch overlooking the water. It was almost like being in a secluded resort. The pool was nice; the restaurant was pretty great as well, though we only at there one night.A few notes about Culebra--be prepared for roosters to wake you up at dawn, and then keep cock-a-doodle-dooing for a couple more hours. You get used to it, but being a city girl myself, I was not prepared. Also, I highly recommend renting a Jeep from Carlos' Jeep Rental. It's located right in the teensy-tiny airport and it's the best way to see this gem of an island. Also, be prepared for a restaurant to not have a dish you order--it's just the nature of being on an island. Sometimes your entree ingredients are on a ship that won't arrive for two more days...such is island life. There are a handful of restaurants on the island that I recommend exploring, including the Blue Iguana and Dinghy Dock. I think we ate at the Dock three or so times. It's right on the water and boats pull up throughout the day. I would also take some time to explore all of the beaches on the island. Zoni is by far the best, though others will try to tell you Playa Flamenco is number one. Don't listen! Zoni has beautiful white sand and was virtually empty when we were there.Culebra is a beautiful island and Club Seabourne is the place to stay.

<Content>Great, relaxing... After reading all of the reviews I was expecting something terrible... it wasn't. The place is great; at least there is nothing better in Culebra. Me and my boyfriend stayed in the deluxe villa- it had the best view, it was very clean and big enough for two of us. If you go to Culebra definitely rent a car! Zoni beach was even better than Flamenco. Keep in mind that everything close early and there is no restaurant open between 3 to 6, one of the local stores has a sign: Open some days, close others :)

<Content>Once upon a time After visiting web site and viewing pictures of the hotel I was sure of making the best decision on booking Club Seabourne for our anniversary. Unfortunately, when given our room, I immediately knew I made a mistake. The room stank of humidity, as if it had been closed up for weeks and just that day turned on the air condition. It was very evident they didn't bother to clean up. The bathroom and the entire floor of the room was filthy (lizard poop, cockroach parts, disgusting!) The bathroom curtain was filled with mildew and the shower was approximately 2 feet wide; the wall of the shower was gooped with silicone to seal (without accomplishing it) the crack (2 inches) between the floor and wall. Needless to say with such little space we had to shower moving as little as possible; water pressure terrible too. Need of major remodeling. The complimentary breakfast was terribly miserable, cold, and left outside on the restaurant terrace to be bothered by flies and mosquitos. Staff in general showed no hospitality or care for our discomfort. Culebra was great, but Club Seabourne should be shut down!!!!!

<Content>A Paradise This small boutique hotel is a paradise. Culebra is a very charming tiny island, so you will not find night life or exciting activities others than going to the beach, relaxing and eating The resort is beautiful, rooms are well kept and very clean. No TV or telephone, so you can disconnect from the outside world. Personnel is attentive and willing to please guests in their needs and desires. The restaurant is superb! Chef Guillermo is very nice and the food is gourmet, at a reasonable price. We will definitely return to Club Seabourne, we will again to go to paradise.Maira and Reynaldo Landa, San Juan Puerto Rico

<Content>Needs An Immediate Makeover! This is my 3rd attempt to send a review on Club Seabourne. The first 2 never made it. We stayed here in January of 2006. I made reservations with Linda. After I paid the deposit, I inquired about air travel to Vieques. She promised to call me that afternoon with the information. She never called. Some weeks later I did some research and made my own reservations on Air Flamenco. Linda (without my knowledge or consent) made reservations with my credit card for air travel. I only found out about this after I got my credit card bill. How unprofessional! I called her about it and she never straightened it out. I called Air Flamenco and spoke to Jose, one of the most incompetent individuals I have ever spoken to. He blamed me for their mistake, but promised to straighten this out. After repeated calls he never did. I had to call the credit card company to rectify the matter.I must say that I was a bit disappointed with Club Seabourne. It seemed nicer on the internet pictures. Those nicer days have come and gone. The place is dated and needs some work. Example: our villa had broken tiles, missing slats on the verticle shade in the bathroom, broken accessories in the room, a stained couch (my wife refused to sit on it), scratched and damaged furniture, blinds in the room that were damaged or broken, etc. The swimming pool area was digusting. The lounge chair cushions and the umbrellas were filthy with mold and the chairs had dog hair on every one of them from the resident muts (they have no collars and are allowed free reign of the grounds). We found the two dogs in the pool area one afternoon and one was laying on a lounge chair! Yuck! Other areas of this tiny resort are in desperate need of repair and/or rennovation. What disturbed me the most were the flocks of roosters that wake you up early in the morning and have access to the grounds without any recourse. I even stepped on bird droppings. Across the street in front of Club Seabourne was an abandoned car that was there our entire stay. What an eyesore. I got a good rate on our stay here, so most of this was bearable. We went out every day anyway to the beautiful beaches (Flamenco and Zoni)which made up for the failings of our lodgings. The food at the complimentary breakfast was fairly good. The food at the diner restaurant was just ok and pricey for what you get. At check-out time I had a problem getting them to honor the special rate I booked. It took about 3 attempts for them to get it right. My wife and I would like to return to Culebra, but not to Club Seabourne.

<Content>Bait and Switch We arrived to find that the Club Seabourne was not as advertised on it's website.The rooms were small, my son had to sleep on the floor, nothing good about the restaurant, they were out of bread, fish and more than half the items on the menu,terrible experience, we hellicopted in, wish we had flown over Seaborne. Beach was beautiful at Flaminco, hotel was a rip off, chef was lazy, web site should be shut down, uses magazine articles, must have a relative in the editorial department!save your family, money and sanity/look elsewhere!

<Content>oh my God, yuck I was so excited to stay for a week at Club Seabourne but little did I know how it really was. The rooms were frightening! The pool smelled like sewer! The service did not exist and the man runing the place was down right rude!!! I was shocked and I am still shocked! They clean the rooms sometimes and sometimes they didnt. The rooms were not clean and smelled like mold. The food was not good either. We couldnt open a window due to lack of screens and so many bugs. I enjoyed the snake and scorpions!!!I wouldnt go back to this place for the world!! God help anyone who stays here. And I was told my room was the best one they had!!! Good luck

<Content>Disappointed We just returned from our first ever trip to Culebra, Puerto Rico. We knew going in that the island was very casual and laid back, so we were not expecting luxury accommodations, but through some web work, we found Club Seabourne. Their website sells you on the promise of a higher end experience and accommodation. Our family of four decided on their Family Villa, at a cost of a whopping $320 per night (2-3 times the average rate on the island). At that price, it has to be good right? Boy, were we wrong. The 鈥渧illa鈥?was located in the parking lot (something that didn鈥檛 make the photos on the website), and it was so tiny there was no room to walk once we put down our bags. We couldn鈥檛 unpack, because there were no closets or dressers to put our things. We immediately went to the hotel staff to ask for another room, but the other rooms were not only booked, but smaller than the place we had. In fairness, the staff person was very nice, and gave us no problem when we immediately checked out.The remainder of our first day was spent looking for other accommodations, which was looking pretty bleak until we stumbled upon a place relatively newly opened just up the road called the Bahia Marina resort. What an awesome place. First only $150 a night for a spacious two room fully air conditioned place complete with full size fridge, microwave and stove. All new appliances. Two queen beds in the BR and a fold out couch if you need it in the LR. 2 Full Baths, and a spectacular view of the Bay. Top it off with a great simming pool, a full service restaurant/bar and truly warm and accommodating staff. Our vacation went from hell to bliss in the turn of a key. We loved it so much we extended our trip by a day, with dreams of chucking it all to stay forever. Jeep rental is key鈥?well worth it. Carlos鈥檚 Jeep rental has the newest fleet, and some of the great snorkeling and beach spots are only accessible w/ 4 wheel drive.One last thing on Club Seabourne鈥?we gave the place another shot and went there for dinner. It was billed as the best place for seafood on the island. Wrong again. Entrees were $20-$30 and the only seafood on the menu was frozen lobster tails that were broiled, hard and over seasoned, or lobster rice with bits of the aforementioned lobster and tons of uninspired rice. Service was good, but the food way overpriced for what it was. We did find, the hands down best dining experience on the island on our last night鈥?Juanita Banannas ----------------. Incredible atmosphere and views only topped but the menu and service. It鈥檚 BYOB, so the emphasis is on the food.Club Seabourne has done a great job of getting hype on the web, on travel sites in local magazine, but I wonder if that is just their marketing or if someone actually went there. If there was a heyday there, it's long gone.

<Content>LOVED CLUB SEABOURNE AND CULEBRA!!! My wife and I vacationed here last Feb. and are heading back. We have been all over the Carribean and basically go to only small / secluded destinations. We LOVED Club Seabourne! No, it is not the Ritz Carlton but we found the staff extremely helpful and courteous, the dinners very good (bordering on gourmet some nights), and the breakfasts adequete. The rooms were comfortable and clean, and again, while not four star, they were very nice. The pool was small but, again, very nice and we had it to ourselves for most of the week.The island itself was a real treat. Down home, local, and friendly. The small local restaurants were very good (Dinghy Dock and Mamacita's were awesome). You basically felt at home within the first day. We were having drinks at the Dinghy Dock one afternoon and were telling the bartender that the bartender at Club Seabourne recommended Mamcita's and suggested that we check that Arlene is cooking when we go. The lady three stools down from us, eating her lunch chimed in and said Hey, I'm Arlene! Make sure you come down tonight and I'll make you some jerked chicken! If I could move to this place I would.

<Content>Seabourne needs a little nudge The Hotel consists of some bungalows, similar to what was in the Catskills 30 years ago, that winter weary Americanos are willing to put up with in order to catch some rays. Staff aim to please and generally accomodate the guests. Important to understand that nobody, but nobody, on this island breaks into a sweat ever. For instance, the Seabourne hotel shuts down its kitchen on Mondays. when one asks the hosts where one is to go for dinner, they shrug their shoulders, and offer the names of some greasy spoons in town, a taxi cab away. Service at dinner is predictably amateurish, but well meaning. wait long enough and you will get some grub. breakfast is included and is serviceable; no five star hostelry buffet this. some of the beaches in culebra are truly maginficent, and some are so - so. dont bother with flamingo beach. all are a car ride away from the hotel. somebody told us last year this place doubled its rates recently. more power to them. if they can get the yankee dollar, all the better. at 40% lower rates this place would be a find, at these rates they need to tighten up their act and present their product with more class, finesse and panache, or else guys like me will be unlikely to return.

<Content>Had a good time Overall a very charming resort. We enjoyed our stay. Don't expect big resort amenitities, after all it IS a mini resort. The rooms were clean and the restaurant good, if a little expensive. Our kids enjoyed themselves, even though our son had to get his fix of TV in the lobby most nights. The island as a whole was amazing (our friend is planning on staging a coup so she can take over.....so beware). Flamenco beach is everything it is advertised to be, but spend the extra few bucks to get chairs and umbrellas on the beach. The sand is amazing, like powdered sugar! Zoni beach is very beautiful, but a little rocky. Mamacitas was a bit overrated. We really like Dinghy Dock, the food was inexpensive but great and the view was the best of any restaurant. Try the little pastaillos stand on the road back from Flamenco beach, by the airport. The little old lady makes some great chow.Probably the only complaint we had was during checkin at the hotel. We were first but the staff cut us off to take care of some natives PRs while we waited....and waited. It was irritating to be so obviously discriminated against. the management knows when the ferry arrives, maybe they should have some extra staff there for check in?Overall, the stay on the island was great, and you really can't expect evrything to go your way. We will go back but might split our time between a couple of other places for less money

<Content>Charming Club Seabourne does offer the best looking accomadations on the Island. However, there are no television sets in the sleeping quarters. While that was okay with me, my honey had a hard time understanding why it was we payed sooo much money.We had a nice stay, the service was okay and the breakfast was also okay. We didn't get a chance to have dinner there so i can't write a review on that.Overall, very charming place to stay. Room was very clean and well kept. Also looked exactly like the pictures online with the exception of the pool. It was kind of small. We'd definately stay there again.
