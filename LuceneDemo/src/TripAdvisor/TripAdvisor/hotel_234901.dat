<Content>Friendly people and good service November 2008.We had booked another hotel but there were some problems so after some phonecalls we checked in at the BB hotel Berlin.The personel was very friendly and we've got a room directly.It was no problem that we were there very early (we left home, the Netherlands at 03.00 am so we were very tiered) In the morning they have a breakfast buffet with lots of different kind off food and in the evening the have diner. First you get a homemade soop, than diner and after that desert. It was realy tastefull.Our room was not so big, but it was clean and the bed's slept very well. The hotel was very close to the underground station and busses.We had a perfect stay in Berlin thanks to the personel of the BB Hotel.

<Content>Great Gay Location - Poor Facilities Hotel was okay - great location for Folsom Europe (on fuggerstrasse) - but the hotel facilites and hospitality are VERY BASIC. The general hotel was kept clean and tidy, there is no do not disturb signs in the hotel, or housekeepers who observe your wishes. The hotel isn't profecient in bookings - as they got ours mixed up! and the language barrier is an issue for non german tourists.The hotel however does offer some privacy and discression - providing you keep quiet, as walls are thin.I don't think I'd stay here again as it is overpriced for the facilities it provides, and the lack of services, and other hotels in the area seem more competitive when it comes to value for money.

<Content>Decent place for a few nights We stayed at the hotel BB (also known as Wenzel and BB Berlin - we could not figure out which was the correct name) for six days in February 2005. The hotel was basically okay, however, it obviously had some hospitality problems. Although we booked in advance, at first they placed us in a chillingly cold room on the second floor that had no double glazing and only one weak light bulb. Besides, the windows faced a rather busy Martin-Luther-Strasse. After some complaining, we obtained a transfer to an obviously renovated room on the first floor with PVC windows that faced the courtyard. This one was thoroughly enjoyable: spacious, with high ceilings, light and quiet. The breakfast was excellent: a good choice of salami, cheese and cornflakes. Finally, it has to be noted that the hotel is about 7-10 minutes away from the nearest metro station, but it is conveniently located in the midst of a gay neighbourhood and in proximity to a few nice Italian restaurants.
