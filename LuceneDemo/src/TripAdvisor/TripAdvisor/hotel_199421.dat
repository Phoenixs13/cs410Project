<Content>The best hotel to stay in Berl铆n It's not the tipical urban hotel, and I new it, but it isn't so far from the center, just 6 min by car (and they offer you the best limo service I've ever seen.). Big and comfortable rooms, all spaces inside the hotel are suitable to stay.

<Content>quiet gem in a residential area If you would like to have all the major tourist attractions in walking distance or a quick cab ride away, then you are better off staying at the Hyatt or somewhere more central. But if you are looking to de-stress, the Schlosshotel is perfect! It is tucked into Berlin's quiet and elegant Grunewald/Dahlem residential area. In busy traffic it has taken us up to an hour by cab to get to the Brandenburg gate or Potsdamer Platz and even the Kurfuerstendamm can be a 10-minute drive. That said, we have stayed at the Schlosshotel a few times and will return. You get great value for your money. Each room is individually designed with charming, classical decor. I wouldn't stress too much who the designer is, because if I had known before visiting it could have easily turned me off. But it's actually very tastefully done. In spite of all the curtains and carpets it still feels light and playful. The atmosphere is that of a residence more than that of a hotel. The breakfast buffet is splendid! and the staff is attentive and polite. I have seen someone from the front desk sprint down the block after a guest who had left a glove. In the summer your breakfast on the terrace or in the beautiful garden will easily turn into brunch and then lunch... The pool is not deep but it's warm and nice to lounge around, get a massage, and relax. You might be the only in one there all day.

<Content>Almost perfect We spent a weekend here and really enjoyed the experience. The room was stylish, the staff friendly and helpful and the food fantastic. Breakfasts were amongst the best we have had.The short trip from the centre of Berlin is worth it to get to an elegant building in a noise free environment.I could not relate to the comments about smoking; we hate smoke as well but did not encounter this problem the whole weekend

<Content>More than just a disappointment.... While the decor of this hotel is splendid, it misses the mark in several areas and is, frankly, not worth the price. If you're a non-smoker, you will have no where to run from the cigar- and cigarette smokers who are catered to here (yes, there is a non-smoking section in the dining rooms, but you might as well have a non-peeing section in a pool). When asked if there was a place non-smokers could go, we were directed either outside, or to our rooms. Not nice for a place that charges over $200 a room (minimum) a night.The TV program cards in the rooms do not accurately reflect where the programs are (poor attention to detail, or simply not caring), and the DVD players in the rooms only play Region 2 (Europe) discs, which hardly caters to an international crowd.There are no coffee services in the rooms (a standard, and welcome commodity in much less expensive houses), forcing you to pay outrageous amounts for room service.The food prices are extremely high, and you may find that what you want is not available (as happened to us more than once). The breakfast is 23 euros per person and, while slightly varied, is not worth it. Nor is $20 for a small bowl of spaghetti, or $10 for a bottle of water.We also had poor experiences with the wait staff. While they are polite, and completely bi-lingual, we were charged $25 for our Complimentary Welcome Drink, which was later rectified by offering us six finger sandwiches and two small pieces of cake. The staff is always polite when things go right or wrong, but too many things went wrong too often. And at these prices, it really wasn't worth it.

<Content>The Hidden Gem in Berlin A late booking that turned into a wonderful experience after searching Europe for a 5 star break with Spa. A hotel of the highest quality. Attentive staff who made us feel King and Queen of the Castle throughout our stay. Every need given the utmost attention without being intrusive. One the the nicest Spa's we have experienced (absolutely spotlessy clean with all you could need) - perfect attention to detail - again staff looked after our ever need before we had the opportunity to know we needed it. Resturant absloutely fantastic and a must do if you choose this hotel. Travel was easy using local transportation - so its worth the 10 minute journey outside the centre of the City. When we had the opportunity to see other Hotels at the same level in Berlin it was easy to see we had made the right choice. Would not consider staying anywhere else if we revisited Berlin or this area. If you fly through Templehof use a Taxi at around 20 Euro - otherwise you will find it hard to find the hotel. Althought only 10 minutes walk from Grunwald S Bahn (plus a short bus ride), its not easy after a flight. Once you know the transportation system S and U Bahn and bus are great to get around the city.

<Content>Stylish Hotel My wife and I just got back from a great weekend break in Berlin staying at this classy hotel. When you walk into the hotel you immediately realise that you are staying somewhere special. There is a sense of history that permeates throughout the hotel, from the baronial lobby to the fantastic bar that feels like an exclusive gentlemen鈥檚鈥?club. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a suite, which was stunning and very tastefully designed, as you would expect from Karl Lagerfeld. We loved the antique wardrobe, the Hermes toiletries and the very comfortable bed. All the staff were very friendly and tried very hard to make our stay very pleasurable, although, sometimes you were kept waiting for service a little longer that you would expect at a 5 star hotel. Our main criticism would be with the food at their Vivaldi restaurant. The quality of the ingredients and the preparation were first class but the combination of flavours was far too complex. Possibly because we are used to London restaurants were the favours are much simpler and allow the ingredients to speak for themselves we found the combination at the restaurant a bit strange and not to our palate.Before you book this hotel bear in mind that you will need a taxi to get to the centre, e.g. Brandenburg Gate was 16 Euros. But every taxi driver knew where the hotel was for the return trip and were pleased to take us back to the hotel where the German Football Team stayed during the World Cup.On reflection it was a wonderful hotel and we will definitely stay there again on our next trip to Berlin.

<Content>Just the way we want it ... We booked a special stay at an interesting price trough the website of the hotel itself. From the moment we arrived we felt very welcome. This is a small hotel so service is very personal, which we appreciated. Beautiful  romantic rooms. Nice bathrooms. Great swimming pool  sauna. Fantastic breakfast. Our special package included a dinner in the hotel restaurant and this was also excellent. Located in the high-class diplomatic area of Berlin, away from the noise of the city. We came to Berlin by car and we didn't have any problem to get to the city center (max. 20 min) so I guess it's also easy by taxi. Great historic building !Ideal for a relaxed stay in style, away from the noise but close to the city.

<Content>Wellness, shopping and gourmetdinner Excellent, peacefull and very elegant hotel. The staff is young but very professional and attentative. The wellness area is kept in a immaculate state- a drop of water on the floor is wiped clean at once. The restaurant and bar is cosy, elegant and decorated with great care of detail. The breakfastroom is delightfull. We had full value for our money.

<Content>Beautiful romantic Hotel Beautiful romantic hotel with great service. The food In Michelin star restaurant Vivaldi Is very good. Our suite (room 10) was very spacious but unfortunately It was located right above the bar. The loud music kept us awake.Visitors are not allowed to make pictures In the hotel without permission鈥o I can't show you how beautiful the hotel actually Is. The Kurfurstendamm Is 5 minutes by car.PR could be better鈥 never heard of It until I searched the web.

<Content>Quiet Location, Faultess Hotel Okay, so it's a cab ride in to the City Centre (approx 鈧?5), but that distance is a large part of this hotel's attraction. The service from the moment we arrived was friendly, attentive, and efficient. The room was beautifully furnished with amazing attention to detail. The public areas are opulent yet cosy and the gardens and terrace bar are a welcome oasis. If you can cope with the distance from the city centre, then this hotel represents a peaceful and private alternative to similarly priced city hotels.

<Content>Splendid hotel, confusing management It shows that they have 4 General Managers, 2 different owners and two different managing companies in just one year. As a matter of fact, the hotel is managed by Dorint. Regent is just a franchise label! As I heard, the hotel will be sold and be under new managament again as of Jan 1, 2003! However, the new chef (spangled with two stars from the Michelin guide) is very good and the architecture and design are just stunning. In fact the only 5 star+ hotel in Berlin in a truly historical building, originally built for the last emperors attorney in 1914. And the only 5star hotel in Berlin two have its own garden, splendid in summer for weddings and receptions, also featuring a tanning lawn for the pool users!In short: Rather a city resort than a typical business hotel!
