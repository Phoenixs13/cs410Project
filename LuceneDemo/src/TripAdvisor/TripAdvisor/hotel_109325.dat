<Content>If only all hotels were this nice Everything here was great, we had a very pleasant stay. We enjoyed everything. The room was spacious and quiet. The kids enjoyed the warm uncrowded pool, I enjoyed the workout room early in the morning, we all ejoyed the comfortable beds, my son even liked the fold-out sofa. The breakfast was good too. A bit of advice; make sure not to be late for breakfast, they are prompt at closing time and the tables fill up quickly. We would love to stay here again, and I wish all hotel stays could be this nice.

<Content>Not a safe place! The Hotel room was nice I cant complain at that, but the area the hotel is situated is not that good at all. There is a gas station next to it that had people standing waiting to be picked up for odd jobs! on the last day of my stay I went out to my car to find it had been broken in to in the parking lot and my GPS stolen, the annoying thing is it wasnt even on view, so they must have watched me hide the GPS in my center compartment, they smashed my window and ONLY stole the GPS. If you do stay here, HIDE ANYTHING of value before you park as they must watch you hide things first and then break in !!

<Content>We were robbed We stayed in the Comfort Suites near the intersection of Hwy 75 (Central Expressway) and 635 (LBJ) for about a week in early September 2008. Toward the end of our stay, we returned to our locked room only to find my husband's briefcase with his computer, credit cards, medical insurance cards, etc. stolen. I lost a large backpack that was full of my genealogy research, several software programs, various books and other items. A police report was filed and an insurance form provided by the hotel was submitted to the manager.We have heard nothing from the hotel or the insurance company since. Later, after contacting the manager, the owner, and the parent company separately, we received no response or communication regarding the insurance or loss. It has been over a month ago, with no reponse at all.The hotel room itself was adequate, with a fairly comfortable bed, but a totally worn out couch and chair with broken springs.We will never stay there again!Beware!

<Content>Disappointed! My husband and I just spent 4 nights at this hotel and overall we were very disappointed. Mostly from two things - our air conditioner was SOOO loud, it sounded like an airplane engine. We were going to change rooms but figured they would probably all be that loud. Not only was it loud but also rattled - so annoying. But that wasn't the worst part, we got up on our second morning and walked to our car and see some people standing around their car and they asked if our car was ok because their truck's passenger window had been smashed out and items were stolen. Luckily our car was fine but we felt really bad for them. Then the hotel never cleaned up the glass, it was still there when we left this morning! The location of the hotel is not great. It is confusing to find, confusing to get on I-75N from, and there is a sketchy apartment complex right behind it with some creepy/sketchy people walking through the parking lot at all hours. No wonder you have to use your key card to access the front lobby after 9pm! The only good thing about the place, the price and the room layout. You have a separate living room area and separate bedroom area. Too bad the air conditioning is only in the bedroom area so that made it difficult for the living room to get cool enough. Oh, one last thing, you should bring an eye mask if you want to sleep in, the windows didn't have heavy curtains to keep the room dark. Only sheer curtains, I couldn't believe it. Anyway, I hope this helps you decide if you want to stay here or not. I would personally suggest staying a little more north - like at the Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Select (along 75 in Richardson).

<Content>One of the better Dallas places to stay This is one of my favorite places to stay when I travel to Dallas. The rate is good, the rooms are clean and quiet, the couches are comfortable. The breakfast was good. The only trouble I had was the treadmill which I couldn't run on- I kept tripping on it. But the exercise bike was fine.

<Content>Good hotel for price. We stayed here for 3 nights and had a nice stay, overall. There were a couple minor problem that were quickly addressed by the staff. Our King suite was clean and fairly large. The living room w/ sofa bed and bedroom were in separate rooms, entirely. What puts this hotel over the top was the rate. $70 a night!!! Great bargain. We will stay here again.

<Content>Good bargain, central location This was an excellent bargain. It is on a highway in the middle of construction, but access is easy enough, and at $59/night with free full buffet breakfast, paper, and unlimited local calls for .50 per day, indoor pool, exercise area, convenience store next door, friendly staff, nice rooms, it was worth it. There is also a back entrance off of Coit Rd. to avoid the highway entrance if you like. And many restaurants and activities close by. There are also a Holiday Inn Express right next door if this one is full, and another hotel just up the road. Join the Choice Hotels program for award points, and free local calls.
