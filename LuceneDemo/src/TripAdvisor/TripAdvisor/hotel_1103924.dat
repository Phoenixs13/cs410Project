<Content>Hotel Most Suitable Just home from a four day stay at this hotel. Had previously stayed nearer the centre of the city the last time in Barcelona and the noise made it impossible to sleep. This hotel might be a little further out but was much more convenient than I expected.A very quiet area but due to a new metro opening just less than 2 mins walk from the door and a 10-15mins journey on the green line and we were right on the Ramblas. This stop saved us from walking over to the main Sants Train station to get metro. We arrived at the train station coming in from the aeroport and took a taxi to our hotel which cost just over 8 euros for 2 but we later discovered it was only just over a 5 min walk if we had been sure of the directions.The hotel staff were excellent. Helpful and friendly which means a lot when it is hard to communicate as not many speak English.The rooms were very adequate although not many lights and the breakfast was excellent. Being in a quieter area not many resturants nearby but we found it no problem to take the metro into city centre when looking for more choice to eat. Resturant in hotel for evening 3 course meal looked really good but more than what we were looking for to eat.. I would recomment this hotel for freindly and helpful staff , quiet area and convenient to centre etc. We booked this hotel through hotelconnect and got a very good offer. Was a little bit worried about the hotel due to reviews on other web sites but these proved not to be a problem for us.Elizabeth, Co.Antrim
