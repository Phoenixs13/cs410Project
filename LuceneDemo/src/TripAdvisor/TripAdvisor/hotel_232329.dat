<Content>Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Okay, firstly, we booked a 2 night stay at Hotel Alexander through Rates2Go.com based primarily on TripAdvisor reviews. We arrived there and were shunted to this dive on the pretense that the Hotel Alexander was booked out and told that they were both of equal standard...Let's get the very limited number of positives out of the way first. As other reviews note, the hotel is located reasonably close and within walking distance of the main attractions. However, the actual address is difficult to find and down a dingy back alley (NOT on a canal).Now to the negatives:- Rude, unhelpful reception on arrival (quite sure it was the owner too!)- We arrived to an ice-cold room as they left the windows open when it was negative 2 degrees outside (presumably to rid some of the stench)- After getting the room back to normal temperature, they turned our heater off when we were out of the room, so we yet again returned to an ice-cold room!- The lift doesn't work 90% of the time and very difficult staircase especially with luggage.- Dirty, dated, decrepit, stained, smelly furnishings- Carpet that you don't want to walk on barefooted- Breakfast was adequate if you like a slice of untoasted, stale bread, boiled egg and a wide selection of cherry jam.- Bill was not fixed on departure but the useless reception worker was nice enough to laugh that we'd been transferred from Hotel Alexander to here and said That is three stars, this is maybe one, The same owner owns both anyway and even more ominously Don't worry we have your credit card details.So we left feeling violated, having no idea what will be charged to our credit card and feeling like we had been scammed.PLEASE NEVER STAY HERE. Please consider even the cheapest, nastiest hostel before this crack den.

<Content>Certainly in need of refurbishment! 16-18 July 2008I stayed with friends at the Hotel De Looier for a weekend. The plus points were - friendly and helpful staff, beds were comfortable and clean and the bathroom was clean with plenty of clean towels. The hotel is in a quiet location within walking distance of Leidesplein where you can find a good selection of bars and restaurants. From there it is easy to take a tram to Dam Square and other tourist attractions. On the down-side the hotel was in desperate need of refurbishment and there was an awful smell in the lift (probably the drains). The breakfast was ok, we did check the dates on the butter as an earlier review said that this was past its use-by date but it was actually the brown bread that we found to be mouldy! Worst of all for us - three girls sharing a room - was that we had no mirror in our room - an absolute necessity for getting ready for a night out!! We did mention this at reception but nothing was done about it! Also one of our beds was folded up against the wall which we had to assemble and make up ourselves. I certainly won't stay here again unless they give it a complete make-over!

<Content>in need of some tlc Just got back from staying here and it was a disappointing last night of our holdiay. Amsterdam is pricey in general and this seemed one of the more reasonably priced places and was rated as three stars. The staff were friendly and helpful but the hotel itself really needs to have some money spent on it. The hotel blurb says that it was recently renovated, I don't think so. The decor and furnishings were old, dated and fraying at the edges. For example the back was coming off the wardrobe, the bedroom carpet had a number of worked in stains and bald patches, the bathroom door had a hole in it, the woodwork had graffiti on it and the grouting in the bathroom was mouldy and brown. The breakfast room resembled an eighties disco, the breakfast itself was okay, the coffee and eggs were good. On the plus side the bed mattresses appeared to have been replaced reasonable recently and the linen and towels were reasonable quality and clean.

<Content>Never again I think the De Looier was the worst hotel I've ever had the misfortune to stay in. The room was dirty, as we found the hotel in general. The smell, of what I presume was the drains, was nauseating. It was a dark dingy hole. In fairness the location wasn't bad. We made the stupid mistake of waiting in reception one day whilst our room was cleaned, leaving a mobile phoneon the side.......the mobile was never seen again!

<Content>Had a great time I stayed here with my partner and we were happily surprised. The hotel is down a back street so it is very quiet. The room we stayed in was clean and big. The breakfast wasn't great and we would just have coffee and eat out. But the staff was friendly and the hotel was in a safe area. Would definately stay there again.

<Content>Awful Stay Awful Stay, Room ws small and bed was lobsided and uncomfortable. I was woken up at 8.30 every morning with construction work going on behind my room. I was never informed of this by the hotel staff on my arrival. I also picked up 5 bites from what I can only presume was a flea in my room.I would avoid this hotel at all costs!!!!!

<Content>Nice,comfy hotel We are just back from a 3 night stay in the de Looier hotel and we had a great stay. The hotel is a two minute walk from the Marlay bus station (no 370 goes directly from the airport 3euro), and is a 5 min walk from Leidseplein, and is in a safe,quiet area. The staff were very nice and helpful and gave us maps and directions. The hotel was very clean and well kept and our room was large and the beds very comfortable. We paid 385 euros for the 3 nights incl breakfast and would definately return to this hotel next time we visit amsterdam. :)

<Content>Nice big room in a cosy hotel I stayed in a triple room with my mother and a close friend. The price was 鈧?25 which is expensive but among the cheapest acceptable alternatives in Amsterdam during the high season.The hotel is situated in a quiet area in the inner city about 10 minutes by foot from the Dam Square. The hotel is close to the tram stop Elandsgracht where trams 7,10 and 17 stop.The hotel has a laid back atmosphere with a cat sleeping in the corridors. There was absolutely no smell of anybody smoking any dodgy cigarettes which is very nice if that's not your thing.The room was big enough with a double and a single bed. However the door to the bathroom didn't open completely as the bed stood to close to it. The bathroom itself was quite small and had a shower. The rooms was very clean and had a TV-set but no remote control. The breakfast was nice with cold meats, cereals, two different sorts of bread, cheese, jam and sponge cake. The breakfast staff was OK however they started to remove the various breakfast items a couple of minutes to 10 even though the breakfast was supposed to end at 10 which made you feel uncomfortable, stressed and unwanted there.The reception staff was indifferent.All in all a satisfactory yet overpriced alternative.

<Content>Good value The hotel was generally quite good and is located on a quiet street. The room was spacious and clean, and the bathroom was good. It was very hot (middle of a heatwave) but the staff were very helpful and actually purchased a fan for us! The breakfast was very good compared to other 3-star hotel breakfasts. Perhaps the only drawback is its distance from the city centre - it is about a 20 minute walk from Amsterdam Central Station, although the walk goes through some very nice streets including the antiques shops. It is, however, possible to take the tram.

<Content>Good Choice This was my second stay at this hotel and I was not dissapointed.The hotel is well located and is only 5mins walk from my favourite square in Amsterdam, Leidesplein, which is full of open air cafes, restaurants and within walking distance of the museums and boat cruise stations. To get to the hotel its a simple tramride from the centraal station, a journey that takes about 5mins.The hotel is in a nice and quiet side street facing the canal in the antique quarter so is surrounded by small antique shops and a couple of quiet bars, the staff are very friendly and helpful, the rooms neat and tidy with ensuite facilities and the buffet breakfast excellant with the usual mix of boiled eggs, meats, pastries and toasts.The main advantage of this hotel is that its excellant value and has a great location, and I wouldnt hesitate to stay there again next time I'm in Amsterdam, which hopefully wont be too far away.

<Content>love amsterdam Stayed at the De Looier from the 28th april- 01 may 06. The hotel is very clean and the staff very friendly. We were treated very well ,even tho we had constant phone calls coming into the room and people coming in to pick us up,the hotel were more then helpful to accomodate our busy timetable!! Even when we checked out they made sure we had somewere to store our luggage.We never made it to breakfast,so i cant comment, but it was a very clean and friendly hotel,in a excellent location,so if you are visting amsterdam,give this hotel a try,and belive me , you will not be disapointed.
