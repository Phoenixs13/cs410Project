<Content>A good choice for a family We are a family with 3 young children who were looking for a break from the Xmas mayhem in the UK and we struck lucky! For those of you with +2 young children you will know how hard it is to find somewhere suitable to stay and Paris is particularly challenging. Having searched numerous hotels from guide books in Trip Advisor the Rochester looked a consistently good choice and it was.It's very well located 2 mins from the Metro and 2 mins from the Champs Elysees. You can walk to the Eiffel Tower in about 30 mins, the Louvre is about the same and the Notre Dame is about an hour away. Cross the Champs Elysees and you soon come to the Avenue Montaigne with its very exclusive fashion houses - Chanel, Hermes etc. You won't be able to go in to these shops unless you are ultra rich but its good fun to look and imagine.The hotel was smart, very tastefully decorated and the reception staff were always helpful. This is not a big gltzy hotel but if you want that in Paris you will need to pay a lot more money. We had 2 rooms next to each other which worked well, high up on the 7th floor. Everything was very comparable with a 4 star hotel in the UK. You don't get drinks making facilties in the room but you do get a minibar (an expensve option as always) but there is a supermarket across the road if you want to buy some drinks to have on hand. We emailed the hotel direct after booking through an agent to ensure we got suitable rooms for our needs and they were very obliging.Our deal included breakfast (23 euros if extra) which is a great plus when many hotels in Paris won't include breakfaats in the price. It was the usual mixture of european cuisines - meats, fruits, cereals, a small selection of hot food - and whilst the breakfast room was small we only had to wait a few times for a short while.A few top tips if you are going to Paris, especially with children. Pre-book your tickets for the Eiffel Tower because the queues are nearly always several hours long. The Batobus, a circular ferry service (Eiffel, Musee Orsay, St Germain, Notre Dame, Jardin des Plantes, Hotel de Ville, Champes Elysees) is a good way to get around. The Metro is easy to use and the Mobilisi ticket (1 to 5 days unlimited travel) is a good bet and you purchase it in the station from the automated machines (NB - you can choose English and scroll down for the 'Other Tickets' options. You can pay with your debit card.)So in summary, the Rochester is a good choice for families if you want an authentic Parisian hotel, which is very comfortable, affordable and well located.

<Content>This Hotel is Fantastique! I recently stayed at the Rochester with two girl friends to celebrate my birthday. As it was my 21st I wanted something a bit special from my Parisian hotel and knew I'd found the perfect one in the Rochester, after weeks of hunting. When we arrived I was delighted with the location of the hotel, just off the champs 茅lys茅es really close to metro station Franklin Roosevelt which had good connections to both the right and left bank.  The reception staff were helpful and spoke in english when my french failed me. We arrived a little early but after waiting for a coule of minutes in the beautiful lobby, were taken to our room with no problems. I had had real difficulty finding a nice triple room in Paris, so I was thrilled with our huge room with a king sized bed for 2 of us and an extra single that had been wheeled in and added to the foot of the bed. Both beds were really comfortable and offered plenty of room, to be fair we all could have slept in the king sized bed it was so big. The bathroom was also a delight and a good size, for a Parisian hotel it was a huge bathroom! With plenty of fresh towels, soaps, shampoo etc. We had a bath with a shower above it which was perfect with plenty of hot water. Everything about the room and bathroom was clean, I have no complaints and we had air conditioning which meant our room was always a comfortable temperature.In the booking I had made breakfast was included, otherwise I think it's and extra 23euros each, which I personally wouldn't pay. The breakfast was really good. The hotel offer a selection of bread, pastries, fruit, yoghurts, cold meats and cheese and smoked salmon. They also have hot breakfasts of egg, bacon and sausage. Overall The trip was fantastique we had no problems with our room, the service or the food and checking out was just as easy as checking in. A brilliant stay.

<Content>Rochesters was an excellent choice!! The Rochester Champs-Elysees hotel was a delightful little hotel in the heart of Paris. The staff was so helpful especially the concierge, Roshan, who was extremely responsive to all my needs...and always with a smile! The hotel is ideally located in the middle of all the attractions! The Champs-Elysees is a couple of blocks away and the shopping is wonderful!!!

<Content>Great Hotel  This hotel has a great location just 2 minutes walk from Champs Elysees. Room was a junior suite, loads of space and well maintained. Breakfast fairly typical for a paris hotel with a great selection and the breakfast room was well staffed. The concierge was very helpful on the morning of departure but the male receptionist on both evenings was not at all welcoming. The check in experience was borderline rude. The checkout on sunday morning was the complete opposite efficient and polite. I would highly recommend this hotel as a base for visiting Paris.

<Content>Overall 4 star BUT . . . Location great, 3 blocks from Champs Elysee. Close enough for convenience, far enough to be quiet at night. Literally steps from a metro stop. Patisserie, Starbucks and supermarket 1 block away and far enough from Champs Elysee to be uncrowded. Hotel rooms (we had 2 junior suites for a family of 5 with adult children) were as advertised. Nice beds (firm), crisp linens, furniture in good condition. Now for the BUT . . .This hotel was acceptable for the price (ie. location and all above) but the desk staff and especiallly the concierge were inadequate for the price we paid. They were sometimes put out by our simple requests and could rarely complete the tasks for a lack of knowledge or initiative (eg. could not telll us how long it would take to get to certain common locations) and when we left the hotel to load our luggage into the van, not a single one of the 4 staff present helped us. They simply said Au revoir. Bottom line, if you have traveled frequently and can map out your own schedule and route, you would find the advantages outweigh the drawbacks and the hotel is worth the cost. If you rely heavily on the concierge, I would pick a different hotel to feel that you got what you paid for.

<Content>we liked it at the Rochester We enjoyed staying at this hotel: the best feature of it is its location practically on Faubourg St Honore, within easy walking distance from Champs Elysees, The Elysee Palace. The room was good size (especially for Paris!), well appointed, the bath facilities, although slightly narrow, excellent. Service (of the room) was very good, the concierge services though need improving (the wake up call was never made, the taxis came either too early - 1o min - with the meter running, or too late - 25 min.) The registration staff was very prompt and courteous. The common areas, the lobby , the exterior of the hotel look quite impressive and very pleasant.

<Content>Short Business Trip Great Location - hotel is very close to my office, shopping and the metro (great little bakery around the corner that is open early as well as a Starbucks!); Rooms are not the fanciest but has everything you want on a business trip or an active site seeing trip to the city; Very easy to book with their online system and staff is very responsive to letting you know if there is availability; No surprises at check-in and room was ready early;

<Content>Romantic trip to Paris A fantastic hotel in an ideal location.The hotel itself is very well looked after and the decor of the rooms and lobbys was truly Parisian. The only minor critiscism would be that we were left waiting for a while upon our arrival for our room to be prepared, however this was no great issue.We are a young couple and were fairly active while in Paris thus didn't spend much time in the hotel. However the time we did spend there was lovely and the staff helped us in finding some suitable restaurents to eat out in, and bars for drinking.The location is superb for anyone looking to explore the main attractions of Paris, as long as you are not shy of a bit of walking. I would reccomend renting bikes for a day under the superb system they have in Paris, which meant we paid only 1 euro for over 5 hours of rental. Enabling us to get around fairly cheaply while also having a lot of fun.Altogether a rememberable stay!

<Content>Excellent service, perfect location We stayed at the hotel as part of our 25 year wedding anniversary and found it to be welcoming and friendly. The concierge was particularly helpful and friendly and greatly assisted us with arrangements and in finding our way round Paris. Food was excellent and the breakfast buffet offered excellent choice. The Resturaunt was very clean and the service friendly and efficient.The rooms were of good size, well furnished and decorated and spotlessly clean.The hotel is ideally situated about 4 minutes walk from the centre of the Champs Elleyse. There is a Metro station 2 minutes from the hotel entrance.We would certainly recommend the hotel to friends and will use it again on our next visit to Paris.

<Content>Nostalgic trip to Paris My husbandand and I have just returned from a nostalgic trip to Paris (we used to live on the outskirts of Paris 20 years ago). Paris is wonderful and your hotel was splendid. We did not expect such a good standard of cleanliness, luxury and romatric charm from a 3 night city break trip. Wonderful rooms (clean linen and towels every day), very friendly staff, and so near the heart of Paris. We will return. Jane and Paul Neale

<Content>Relax at the Rochester What a gem of hotel in the heart of Paris. The staff were so helpful, the buffet breakfast was super. The rooms were a good size and well appointed, as were the bathrooms. The hotel was spotlessly clean. Only metres away from the Metro. We spent 3 nights at this hotel and will go back wthout hesitation. We cannot speak too highly of it.

<Content>Excellent hotel! This was a lovely hotel. From the moment we checked in the staff couldn't be more friendly. Hotel was to a good standard and even had laptops you could use in the lobby to arrange your sightseeing! Our room was facing the road so we asked to be moved and they moved us to a lovely room. The first room facing the road was very noisy so best to ask for a room facing the courtyard! From our room there was a nice view of the Eiffel Tower! Perfect! Breakfast was really nice too. Buffet brakfast was included in our trip. It was the normal continental style but also on the buffet table was hot bacon, sausages and scrambled egg, incase you're wanting something hot!There's a metro station just around the corner, about 20-30 seconds walk so that made getting around very easy. Concierge are on hand to help with most things from booking taxi's, Helping you with directions and trains etc! Would stay there if we went again!

<Content>Loved this hotel Found this hotel on Trip Advisor last year when my son and I went to Paris for 5 days. It was all I had hoped for - the room was lovely, a small suite with no view but still charming. It's a walk from the Arc de Triumphe and I don't think any of the rooms have a great view but it really is a great little hotel and close to the Metro which made travel very easy.

<Content>Very Noisy............................. never again! We have just returned from this hotel after a three night stay. The hotel itself is clean, comfortable and the staff are very helpful. However, there is a nightclub across the road and we were kept awake all night. The nightclub doesnt close until half past five. The clients of the nightclub had people picking them up and hooting their horns.The dustbin men then arrived at six a.m!We have returned home (a party of 10) exhausted. Never again will be stay at this hotel.If you do book, take your earplugs!!

<Content>Clean, Central, Spot on! My husband and I spent 3 nights in Paris as part of a trip to combine Paris and London. We arrived on the Eurostar at Sunday lunchtime and the taxi to the hotel from the Gare du Nord cost around 10 Euros. As a tip, give Paris a miss on a Sunday - it's dead. My first impression was that the hotel is very gold! Reception is gleaming brass and marble, and I reckon they put yellow lightbulbs in! The hotel is spotlessly clean and has lovely room amenities. The minibar is of course expensive! The bathroom has everything you need and the TV in the room has lots of channels including a movie channel that showed occasional movies in English! To my surprise I discovered that American movies are right - you can see the Eiffel Tower from the hotel room! You had to lean out and twist a bit, but there it was...My French is rusty to say the least but this was not a problem in the Rochester. There were people from lots of different countries staying at the hotel and the staff communicated well with them all. Shops and cashpoints are very close and convenient, and there is a bar or a restaurant every few doors! There is also a 24 hour pharmacy on the opposite end of the street (closer to the Champs-Elysses).General points about our trip to Paris:Everywhere was close and within walking distance. We walked to the Eiffel Tower on the first day, and on the second day we bought a 2-day bus ticket with Les Cars Rouge. It takes you round the main sights in about 2 1/2 hours, or you can get on and off as you like. The ticket was around 20 Euros and lasts 2 days, so we used it a lot for the rest of our visit! Sometimes the driving was a little exhilarating but I have a feeling it's all part of the Paris experience.2 days was not enough to see everything we wanted to see, and we will definitely return. I would not hesitate to go back to the Rochester again.

<Content>Not great...Not terrible The Rochester Champs Elysees is a decent enough hotel, but for the price and its star rating, you could definitely do much, much better. Its sister hotel, the Franklin Roosevelt is only 5 or six blocks away, costs the same and is far superior. The photos of the rooms that other reviewers have posted are pretty accurate of how the hotel looks.The Good: The hotel is on the Rue la Boetie, which is only two blocks from the Champs Elysees, near the rond point FDR. Decent sized rooms. There is free internet and the staff is helpful, if not overly competent. (After paying, I asked a question about my bill and watched as the desk attendant fished a copy of my bill out of the trash with my credit card number, expiration date and name written across the top...eek!)The Bad: Pancake-like pillows, one extra blanket for a twin room, not-too-comfortable beds and a general worn-out and tired look to the rooms. And, of course, that credit card issue...One night at the Rochester isn't going to be unbearable, but I wouldn't stay any longer than that.

<Author>Surprising
<Content>Safe pair of hands After a fair bit of desk research ,we opted for the Rochester.Instinct took me to a Left Bank boutique number, but the hotel's practicality won me over (we were in Paris for a party in the next door street ie. stumbling distance).It's absolutely fine in a functional, comfortable, marbley sort of way. Not big on charm; front desk fairly surly and the hotel bar was closed both the Friday and Saturday night we were there (maybe there isn't really one).Redeeming points are the exceptional location - seconds away from the Champs Elysees - and the price, which i though was pretty reasonable for a 'four star' hotel in that part of town. Try doing the same in London.... In conclusion, thumbs up. Note - there's a fairly pikey nightclub over the road and i woke up to a commotion one morning at 5am to witness a scene straight from Crimewatch

<Content>SPOTLESSLY CLEAN, EXCELLENT LOCATION! I took my 22-year-old daughter to Paris as a graduation present this year and we stayed at the Rochester. We have both travelled extensively throughout N.A. and Europe and this hotel was EXCELLENT VALUE for the money. We are both clean freaks and the hotel was spotless!! Our room was thoroughly cleaned each day...the bed linens were crisp and clean, the bathroom was always sparkling clean with lots of fresh towels available. The bathroom was done in marble...we had one king-sized bed and it was HUGE...more like a California King..and soooo comfortable. The location was superb. You walk about 2 blocks to the Champs Elysee..(we walked day  nite..lots of people around). The cabfare you save by staying at this location is considerable. From here, we walked everywhere, which is the way to see Paris! The Rochester is just blocks from L'arc de triumphe where you can catch the subway to just about anywhere.....or walk to Bato Bus which is the BEST mode of transportation to see all the of tourist sites if you don't want to walk. I would definitely stay at the Rochester again. The other hotels in the same general location are not worth spending more for. The only thing I would say about staying here or at any other hotel in Paris is that the price for including breakfast is not worth it ( for us anyway) ...we only wanted pastry and coffe in the morning and you can just walk up to the Champs and buy it for a fraction of the cost; sit down outside the cafe and people watch

<Content>Wonderful hotel Just returned from a second honeymoon in Paris. Hotel was clean; modern and in the center of the Champs. The room we stayed in was spacious and clean. The only thing we will tell all travelers is that if you are seeking to spend a great deal of time on the left bank (especially in the evening and late evening hours) then this hotel may not be in the ideal location for you. Notwithstanding the above, the hotel is adjacent to the Champs and near two metro stops. We could not be any happier with our selection.

<Content>LOVED THIS HOTEL! The jr. suite was perfect for my 16 and 11 yr old daughters and me on our first visit to Paris during the last week of June '07. The rooms and the hotel were exactly as they appeared on the hotel website. The rooms and bath were clean and spacious -- very comfortable for 3. The daybed (not pullout) in the outer room was very comfortable. We had 2 flat-screen TVs and nice robes and towels. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. I needed milk to take with some medication just as the restaurant staff was setting up for breakfast. Although I was more than hapy to pay for the milk, it was given to me generously and graciously. As others have noted, the location is quiet and very convenient to the Metro. The major line to the Louvre is a 5 minute walk away on the Champs Elysees, and another line to the Eiffel Tower and Boulevard Haussmann is steps away. Other neighborhood amenities include a boulangerie and grocery store within a few yards of the hotel . Dalloyau teahouse and pastries is a couple of blocks away on the elegant Faubourg Saint-Honore. Their chocolates and pastries are not to be believed, and they offer gourmet food to go that rivals anything we've had in San Francisco, although it does not come cheap. B of A customers will find a no-fee Paribas branch with ATMs half a block away. The proximity to Champs Elysees allowed my daughters to have some independence in a safe environment. In short, I can't say enough good things about this wonderful hotel. We would come back in an instant.

<Content>Really Nice Hotel, great location My partner and I stayed at the Rochester Hotel for 1 night in May 2007. The hotel was lovely, we received a free upgrade to a suite. The location is perfect, walking distance to the Metro and the shops on Champs-Elysees. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. All in all, a great hotel.

<Content>would stay again We have just returned from Paris and a two night stay at The Rochester. It scores points for it's location alone, so close to the Champs Elysses and to a Metro Station.The rooms are spacious enough (for Paris) and are very clean. I think looking at some of the photos posted on this site, we may have stayed in an updated room. Our decor was much nicer and the room really light and airy. Two persons to an elevator made us laugh a little but there are two elevators so never had to 'wait' for one as it were.The breakfast which was included in the price was actually surprisingly nice. I was not expecting too much of the Continental breakfast to be honest but was pleasantly surprised. The wait staff were very attentive and replacing items at the buffet tables constantly. We were impressed. Great coffee also.The staff throughout the hotel were all really nice and friendly, particularly the concierge who was most helpful and the barman who filled us up with pistachio nuts one late night.There aren't any great restaurants or cafes close and what is close by is pretty rubbish. We had much better luck eating in the Latin quarter. Take the Batou Bus on the Seine to get around and to see the sights if you have the time - it's far more pleasant than the underground.All in all, we enjoyed the Rochester and would stay there again.

<Content>Great little hotel !! I spent a couple of nights in the Hotel Rochester in October and was very happy with it. The rooms were very clean, the staff was nice and friendly and the location was fantastic.Close by are cafes, a wonderful patisserie and a little grocery store. Minutes from the Champs-Elysees. Just terrific!

<Content>Superb Location We stayed here for 3 nights for my Mum's 60th birthday and thought the hotel was brilliant. The location is fantastic ....surrounded by little cafes, bistros and patisseries and only a few minutes walk to the Champs Elysees.Hotel rooms we've stayed in before in Paris have been tiny but the bedrooms here were really spacious and airy with a large modern bathroom. The reception was also spacious with nice comfy seating areas...everywhere was spotless...The staff here were very friendly and efficient - the concierge was lovely... we booked one of our excursions with him and he couldn't have been more helpful.Our only minor criticism of this lovely hotel was the breakfast was quite expensive and the choice was fairly limited...but apart from this we couldn't fault the hotel and we had a lovely trip. We would definitely return to this hotel if we went again....

<Content>Bad, Bad, Bad !!! Sad to say, the only miserable memory I hold about charming Paris is this hotel, my husband did a reservation almost 2 months in advance to spend 5 days of our honeymoon in it, when we arrived there, the reception guy told us to wait for 20 minutes to get the room ready!!!! I could not keep quiet and after complain, they gave us what they call a superior room, which was acceptable. The breakfast hall was a tiny room where people were squeezed in it like sardines!!! The food was divided into continental and open buffet which no body told us about when we made the pricy reservation, and of course, they put all people on the continental one!!! I don鈥檛 recommend any body to stay in this horrible place.

<Content>Not a four star experience We spent a week at the Rochester in August and I cannot recommend it as a four star experience. The room's carpeting was stained, there was mold in the shower and the towels were horrible. Most of the staff were nice amd spoke excellent English. There is a metro stop a few steps away, but you need to change trains at the next station to get anywhere near the major tourist destinations. As described in previous reviews, the internet hardly ever worked. We did get a courtyard room and it was pretty quiet.I would not stay there again.

<Content>excellent hotel We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during August. The Hotel is in an excellent location, there is a tube stop just a half minute walk away and the Champs elysees just a 5 minute walk.The mini bar prices were very expensive, but there is a supermarket across the road which was very useful.We had breakfast bought to our room every morning with a selection of croissants, rolls, yogurt and fruit.The room was bright, clean and nicely decorated and overlooked the small courtyard. All in all we had an excellent time and would recommend this hotel without hesitation.

<Content>Rochester Hotel is Perfect!!!! The Rochester Hotel was everything and more. My sister and I were only in Paris for two days, but it was the best two days of our lives. We spent the rest of our time in London. The Rochester Hotel was exceptional. The consierge and all the staff at the hotel were so accommodating to us. The hotel was spotless. The rooms were perfect and again so clean. Everything was perfect to make our first stay in Paris so memoriable. We will definitely come back to Paris and definitely stay at the Rochester Hotel.Thank you Louis for everything.Jennifer

<Content>Location is what matters Having visited this hotel mid July 2006, the hotel is just perfectly placed to see all that Paris has to offer. It is a five minute walk to the right to get to the Champs Elysees and to the left a matter of 50 yards to the nearest Metro Station. Prior to arriving the concierge department were excellent in their arrangements for us. They assisted in organising a car to collect us at CDG airport, and a return journey. Both of which were seamless. Upon checking in I was glad to see that my request via the concierge for an upgraded room overlooking the internal courtyard was in place. It was a lovely room with a small dressing area, double bed, seating area beside window which looked out on ground floor to the courtyard and the flowers, a very nice feature. There were a few down sides to the hotel, with the bed not being the most comfortable and the pillows matching. The breakfast was not that great, limited choice for those on continental breakfast and not really value for money. I would have to say that the main selling point that the hotel has is location, with a nice room I feel a 3/4 rating is justified with the service prior to the visit pushing it into the 4 barrier. When in Paris just get ready to walk, go and see as much as you can and enjoy the city, it truly is an amazing city that is best seen by walking. One piece of advice, we decided to go to the Jules Verne restaurant on 2nd floor of Eiffel tower. I would not bother, it was expensive and the view was obstructed by the tower itself, at 拢10 for a small glass of wine at lunch time and food prices to match, there are far better restaurants to go to and just take the lift to the 2nd floor and enjoy the view.

<Content>Fabulous spot; great location! I just returned from a July 2006 stay at the Rochester Champs-Elysees with my two children (ages 9 and 13) and my mother (aged 70), and I loved the hotel. My room, a triple, was incredibly large and quiet (I asked for a room on the courtyard). My mother's room, a single, was also good sized for one person. Her room, which overlooked the Rue d'Boetie, was a bit loud at night as the bar on the street keeps late hours (this did not bother my mother as she is a sound sleeper). All of the necessary accessories, nice towels, bathrobe, in-room safe, mini-bar (very expensive), were present. I found the concierge and porter to be very helpful. The desk staff was fine, albiet a bit short (in a fairly typical French manner) when needed. Breakfast was lovely. The usual croissants and bread, coffeee, chocolate for the kids were available, but also cereal, eggs, sausage, yogurt and coldcuts. Everything was delightful and breakfast was included in our rate. The hotel was very nice to my children (not always the case in Paris). The location cannot be beat. The hotel is located right next to the metro (which we took everywhere) and a short walk to the Rue Faubourg St. Honore and Champs Elysees. However, there were not many restaurants in the immediate area. There is free internet service available on a laptop in the lobby. However, the service never worked any time I tried to access email, so don't count on it. I would definitely stay here again and found it a good value for the money.

<Content>Average hotel, few facilities We arrived at this hotel expecting four star facilities, but were disappointed. There is no restaurant, other than what's used as the breakfast room. The breakfast is very small and the hot selection was TINY...this is charged at 23euro. Our breakfast was to be included, but were charged an extra 7euro each for the hot food. Upon arrival, the front desk person was fantastic and he upgraded us to a suite for free which was great. The rooms are clean and simple and the bed was VERY comfortable.The lifts are the smallest I've ever seen and we had to go up in groups of two....I suppose this could be looked at as quaint, but inconvenient with a pram.The location was great...we were about 3 blocks from the Champs Elysees at the opposite end of the Arc D'Triomphe. The concierge was fantastic...very helpful and accommodating.Overall, it was an ok hotel but we would try something different next time.

<Content>Beautiful hotel in Excellent location Just returned from 6 night stay at the Rochester. The hotel is all together beautiful, and clean. It is two steps from the metro Sainte-Phillipe du Roule and 5-10 minute walk to the Champs Elysees. They are just finishing up some remodeling in the reception, lobby area. The bar that you see in the photos is no longer there. They are making a bigger area that includes a small dining area. It should be complete soon. We saw the tables, chairs, etc. in their wrappings. They have just finished laying carpet in some of the staircases and in our room. Our room had a weird smell, either carpet glue or wood stain, kind of smelled like curry to me. Other than that our room was awesome. We had a suite, however we never used the sitting room, because when we were there we were exhausted and in bed. Nice plasma screen TV on the wall 3 or 4 english channels. Very clean, Toilet in separate room from shower/bath. New plush towels that even smelled good. Lots of closet space. Free laptop for internet use in the lobby was iffy and only worked on occasion. Nice outside sitting area with fountain but it was to cold to enjoy. Breakfast in bed to days and pastries from the patisserie others have mentioned that is just around the corner. Didn't come across any loud bars across the street that others have mentioned. Slept like a log every night. Recommend Olives Restaurant on Roosevelt if you're looking from something close when you're really tired.

<Content>fantastic location Location could not be better, near to all of the major attractions. After reading reveiws on this site we asked for a courtyard room, however although they were available they were not ajoining so we decided to stay in our original rooms overlooking the street. There was some noise as mentioned but we did not find it intrusive. Breakfast was included in our deal but if it isnt its 16 euros or 23euros which is expensive even by paris standards, fantastic pattiserrie just round the corner which is very reasonable. Staff all speak excellent english and more than willing to help. All in all a good clean hotel that I would definitely use again

<Content>Loved It! I LOVE this Hotel. I'm a little late writing my review. I stayed at this hotel 3 times in 2005. The staff is just wonderful. I love the fact that they have a computer/internet you can use in what seems to be a telephone booth in the lobby, the best part...it's free. The rooms and bathroom were quite clean. They offered high speed in the room for a small extra fee. The location is great! Very close to the subway, extremely easy to navigate.The only down side is, one night I stayed in a room that was right across the street from a CLUB...Boy I didn't sleep ALL night, and there were no other rooms...TIP ask for a garden view room to ensure you can sleep at night, or maybe bring ear plugs just in case. But it's just a great little hotel!

<Content>Excellent Service, Room  After recommendations from friends, I decided to invite my girlfriend to the Rochester for a special week-end in Paris (Feb 2006). I visited numerous 4 star hotels in paris and the Rochester was a joy. The room was large and very well decorated but above all very silent. If you want to sleep well that鈥檚 the place to go to: there is even double entry doors to make sure you are not disturbed from any corridor noise. The food was good, the service excellent, the bed very comfortable, there was also a marble bathroom which impressed my girlfriend. The only downside was to find the bar closed. I asked the reception why: they kindly explained it was being renovated and would soon (I believe in spring) re-open with a spa and a fitness room. I will definitely come back to try it.

<Content>beautiful hotel, desk manager from hades last summer we spent 3 nights at the rochester Champs elysees- we live near Rochester NY so we thought this connection had good vibes for our trip. the hotel was nice, good value, wonderful complimentary breakfast, and great location- a short walk from the famous Champs Elysees- with the Arc deTriumph clear a breathtaking sight as we waited for the bus. We booked a show at the Lido and this was an easy walk! Our room facing the street was a bit noisey and the air didn't work at all. We were told that if the windows were opened it would throw off the air. We had to do that every night otherwise we wouldn't have been able to breathe. For 2 of the nights (not weekend nights) the club across the street let out patrons who were roudy and very loud and drunk! Our party consisted of 7 people, we had 3 rooms and the other 2 rooms were fine- good temp and not noisey. The desk manager was abolutely the rudest, most unfriendly service professional we have ever encountered. Although a concierge was normally on duty, it was clear that if that person was busy that this desk man was not at all willing to entertain any questions. This wasn't a hotel policy because the other person on duty in that function was quite nice. My travel friend and I got to expect his rudeness and even predicted how his behavior would be in the AM. not the greatest of accomodtions for us, especially our room and certainly the desk man's personality. Clean, convenient and a wonderful breakfast. If there was someplace else to book, we'd probably try that place, but would book at the rochester if no place else with that price and location was available.  Julia- upstate NY

<Content>Great hotel, great location Our annual office Christmas party was a weekend in Paris. We, a group of 35, loved the Hotel Rochester and recommend it highly. Our booking needed amending a few times beforehand and the sales coordinator, Morgane, was very patient. Upon arrival, all 35 of us were checked in within a few minutes. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a fantastic location -- a two-minute walk from the Champs Elysees, near the metro and with a supermarket almost across the street. It was ideal for a group. Like a previous reviewer, we wish the hotel bar was a little more elaborate, but with so much nightlife so nearby, this wasn't a huge issue. Also, very light sleepers might find the rooms that face the street a bit noisy and should ask for a room facing the courtyard. One light sleeper in our group was in a room overlooking the street and woke a few times from noise. None of the others who had street-side rooms was bothered, however. We had our actual Christmas party at a nearby restaurant, Laduree Champs Elysees, and the food and service were excellent.

<Content>Good hotel-shame about the bar My wife and I stayed here from the 5th to the 7th November. It is very convenient in relation to the Metro and within an easy stroll of all the designer shops. The room was comfortable but the bathroom had frosted glass and no curtains. Given that it faced other windows across a court yard, this was a little disconcerting! The desk staff were very good, but would not/could not open the bar. So after returning to the hotel after a tiring day sight-seeing, we were forced to go out for a drink, or use the (very expensive) mini bar. Apart from this glitch, we found the hotel to be more than adequate and would probably stay there again.

<Content>loved the location We stayed a week at this marvelous hotel and enjoyed the close proximity to just about everything. It is a few minutes walk to the Champs Elysee and the metro station is just around the corner. There was a bakery around the corner from the hotel that was just delightful, and do I need to say how wonderful the bakery and croissants, etc. were!!!!! Everyone in the hotel speaks english so not speaking French is not a problem. My husband speaks French so that we did not have a problem in communicating anywhere we went. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and helpful. If you need to communicate through email and did not want to carry a laptop with you, they have free access in the lobby; however, we soon discovered that their keyboard with the placement of keys is a little different. It took some getting used to, and the internet connection is slow.We would definitely come back and stay at the Rochester.

<Content>The Location of this hotel is superb! If you have read all the reviews of this hotel you get a very fair assesment from all of them as to what to expect.I don't think you can be better placed in Paris to see all the sights and the Champs Elysee is literally a 3 min walk away. Even on a sunday night at midnight it is so buzzy that you feel at the centre of all the action.The Rochester's rooms are very nice indeed with lovely bright bathrooms and both are cleaned to a high standard. The lobby area is all mirrors and gold, not quite my taste and breakfast is ok however I find hotel breakfasts to be poor value.The Rochester is situated on a busy commercial street and being narrow like many Paris roads it is a bit noisy during the week.Request a room overlooking the inner courtyard and that is especially relevant just now whilst building work is going on.Finally two tips: Avoid the minibar / when will hotels price them more realistically, or perhaps they don't want you to use them!! Stock up at the supermarket opposite {closed Sunday}and use taxis as they are very reasonable.

<Content>Very enjoyable My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights in one of the street front rooms and had a delightful stay. The rooms are average size and furnished nicely. The room and the entire hotel is very bright and clean. The hotel staff and concierge group are very friendly and go out of their way to assist you. The breakfast room staff is also very nice.They are expanding the hotel and there is some construction work being done but it is not noticeable. The location is wonderful. Will stay here again.

<Content>Perfect Place to Stay in Central Paris Choose to book up with Paris Travel Service a break for 3 nights for the price of 2 on Eurostar, bargain!Arrived and at first wasn't sure being in a room next to the lift and cleaners room was ideal, but as we soon realised both were quiet! Room very big and exceptionally clean, view out onto the terrace below. Luxury 4* and had everything and more that we wanted. 2 minutes from the tube, so no need to get a cab, only about 15 minutes from Gare Du Nord with 1 change.Breakfast was OK, but plenty of food shops around and supermarket literally across the road for food and cheap wine! I am not a big fan of european breakfast but you could have cooked options if you paid extra. Breakfast was served until 10 I think, so gave you time to relax.Would go back, as central for all sights!
