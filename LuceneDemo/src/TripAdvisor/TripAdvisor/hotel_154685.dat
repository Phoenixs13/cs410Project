<Content>Delivered as Promised I brought my American family to Mexico City to meet my wife's family. We booked 7 rooms at this location primarily for its convenient location and because it appeared to be a good value. They had a bit of construction going on (I hear they are becoming a Sheraton) but dust  noise were not an issue. The kids made full use of the pool and the workout center was excellent. The morning buffet had both Mexican  American favorites which allowed my relatives to sample new items at their own pace. Overall I can't think of anything this hotel could have done better. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a bit of sanctuary in the big city.
