<Content>Good hotel in a fantastic city I stayed for a week at the NH Rallye, a 3-star hotel, while on a business trip. It is very close to Metro station Les Corts (about a 200 meter walk) which is on the L3 line, and if you've been to Barcelona you know that the Metro is the best way to get around. I had a very nice room with a large bathroom and a large desk to sit at while working on my laptop (via wireless connection). The breakfast buffet was good at 鈧?14.00 and the service was excellent. The bar next to the lobby was small but the service was also impeccable. Overall the hotel was not fancy, but for a business trip it was almost perfect -- almost, because the rate for the internet connection was appalling: 鈧?22.00 for 24 hours! Terrible. However, since everything else was outstanding I give it 4 stars.

<Content>Very comfortable hotel For Christmas' Holidays my wife, my 5 years'old boy and I, decide to spend 5 days in Barcelona. We knew the Hotel Chain NH Hoteles (very popular in Spain) since we spent a very nice week during the New years eve 2006/2007 (Malaga and Sevilla).We've chosen the NH Rallye as it was the best price for ourselves (an average of 100鈧琾er room including taxes, services and a wonderful breakfast Buffet!).It's a three stars hotel, very close to the Barcelona Football Stadium, just 5 minutes walking from underground station (that reaches Plaza Catalunya in just 7-10 minutes!); the bus stop is located just one minute walking outside the main entrance.My room was very comfortable, clean, with a huge bathroom/shower. Safety box and minibar were already available in the room, as an LCD TV. The buffet breakfast was very nice and tastefull, with different kind of sweets, ham, eggs, sausages, fruits, yogurth, juices, biscuits, cakes etc. etc (it was perfect also for my son, which is not a gourmet!).To summarize: good choice, good price, staff very professional and always delicious. To recommend!

<Content>Nice Hotel close to business district and FCB! I stayed at NH Rallye for 4 days it was 1 of 3 hotels I stayed in while in Barcelona. The hotel was in a good location for my business meetings, you can walk to the main business area if you like or a taxi costs around 3-4 euors. The room was well appointed and averaged sized with a nice balcony looking out into the surrounding neighborhood. The room was very clean with hardwood floors, the bathroom was large, the ammenities were also very nice. The in room safe was large enough to fit my laptop. The metro was very close to the hotel for getting into the city center. Taxis were easy to locate in the morning and evenings. All of the taxis I took from the city center to the hotel knew where the hotel was located, so instead of struggling with the address, I just had to tell them the name of the hotel. It is also an excellent location if you are going to see the FCB play. The stadium is maybe less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel and some rooms and balconies have views of the stadium. I was there during the qtr-finals and it was cool to see all of the fans heading to the stadium and surprinsignly noise was not an issue after the game ended. The breakast buffet was outstanding with lots of choices of hot and cold foods in a nice setting and excellent quality, I don't know the price as it was included in the rate, but I think it is worth it since alternative choices in the area are slim.The only minor points I wish they could fix are: there was no alarm clock in my room, the only english speaking channel was CNN which was full of static and the shower has no door so the water spills out onto the rest of the bathroom-a nice bath mat would help with that situation. Oh, and I would often come back to the room to find the balcony doors unlocked and opened-I think the cleaning staff opened them while they cleaned. That was sort of unnerving the first night it happened, but I got used to it.I would definitely stay at NH Rallye again.

<Content>not so good when we were staying at rallye hotel our biggest problem was our room. we stayed in a room without a window. it was really awful we couldnt get any fresh air, our room was dark and small. we tried to change the room but the hotel stuff wasnt helpful. it was dark four nights for us. but there was a small garden near the hotel it was very nice and there was a opencor market which was open eveyday to 2a.m. and there was metro station which few minutes walking away so you can go every where you want easily.

<Content>Very good for what we wanted We were going to a concert at the Nou Camp (U2 - corking!), so booked this hotel because it is very close. As it was, we were in our room 20 minutes after the end of the concert, so it was just about perfect from that point of view.There was a mix up with our booking (the fault of the consolidator we booked through) which caused about half an hour's hassle, but once we were in, there were no problems. The room was a little on the small size (but I think we were given whatever was left because of the booking problem). However, there was a very large walk in shower and good facilities, view of Montjuc from our balcony, and it was surprisingly quiet given the location. Breakfast was also very good, and the terrace bar was nice.It wasn't the most central hotel, but only about 10 euros from Placa Catalunia in a taxi. Would definitely use again if we were going to the Nou Camp, but not for a more 'general' trip to Barca - we would stay somewhere more central.
