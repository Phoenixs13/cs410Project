<Content>Real Cheap, Real Conveniently Located This is a very nice place to stay for the price. It is an older hotel, but the room was clean every morning, the front desk staff went way out of their way to help me find things to do while I was there. The restaurant staff looked like they needed a break, because they looked like it was such a burden to serve you food. The front desk staff were polite, friendly, hilariously funny, and good people. The hotel is located about a block away from the Palacio de Bellas Artes, and maybe five blocks from the Zocalo. It is an excellent location. On many nights, I went walking downtown by myself, and nothing happened. I felt very safe. About a block away is the SEARS building, and if you go inside, and take the elevator to the 8th floor, there is a coffee shop with a balcony, and you can sip your latte and see the entire city. Overall, wonderfull experience at Hotel San Francisco.

<Content>Cheapest decent hotel in Mexico City Hotel San Francisco is a good value in Mexico City, but you should be aware that it has some problems.The main reason to choose Hotel San Francisco is cost. You can get a room with two full-size beds for just $40, by taking advantage of discounts that are perpetually available through Otel, Expedia, CheapTickets, and other sites. You cannot get this rate by showing up without a reservation -- the normal rate is about $70. If you can't get a room at a discount rate, don't bother -- there are better hotels in Mexico City.The rooms seem to be in various states of remodeling -- I've had some nice rooms in this hotel, and some rooms where everything was stained and cracked. All of them were acceptable.The hotel is on a side street, a five-minute walk from the metro, the Palacio of Bellas Artes, and the edge of the Centro Historico shopping area. The safety of the neighborhood is acceptable, but there are plenty of safer places to stay in Mexico City. (Go just a few blocks north of the hotel, and you'll be in the rough Col. Guerrero/La Laguanilla district -- not a safe place to be at night at all.)The biggest problem with this hotel is all the construction in the neighborhood. The 1985 earthquake damaged or destroyed most of the buildings on the block where the hotel sits. The hotel was repaired and opened after about a year, but the building next door was razed and is only recently being reconstructed. Construction is loud, dusty, and begins early in the morning. At times, the street in front of the hotel is closed, and taxis must drop you a block away. Every once in a while, something happens to the sewer, and horrible-smelling sewer gas enters the rooms through the drains. The construction probably explains why this decent hotel in a safe neighborhood is so cheap.The rooms in this hotel are constructed in a more closed, carpted, sterile modern style, rather than in the traditional open, tiled, ventilated Mexican style. This helps cut down on the construction noise, but you can still loudly hear it in the morning. You might ask for a room not facing the construction.Beware that this hotel may have security and theft problems. The rooms do not have card-key locks like newer hotels have. On a recent stay, hundreds of dollars worth of silver was stolen from a friend's room. This wasn't enough to deter me from staying there again, because I carry nothing valuable, and every cheap hotel in Mexico City potentially has theft problems; however, be sure that you lock anything of value in the hotel safe.Interestingly enough, Hotel Del Angel and Suites Del Angel are owned by the same management company as this hotel.

<Content>decent hotel - TONS of construction in area though We just stayed at this hotel for 4 nights on a vacation. The hotel is decent, although not overly impressive. The staff when we checked in were kind of rude, but the other staff in hotel were better for the remainder of our stay. The rooms were very clean and seem to have been recently painted. The bed was comfortable and we had a decent view, although the hotel is in the middle of a huge constuction project - it will be great in about 6 months when its done, but for now its kindof like living in an obstacle course as the streets are all dug up and detoured in neighborhood. Due to construction it was really noisy - clearly not the hotels fault. Also it was pretty hot in Mexico theis past week so the room was pretty hot at times and the first fan they gave us din't work well - they were nice abot replacing it with one that worked. Leaving the window open at night brought in uninvited guests - mosquitos so we learned to deal with the rom being kind of warm. Anyway, the place is decent - we got a great price for it through Hotwire and it is well located and provides a decent level of basic services.

<Content>Not so bad after all We stayed at the SF hotel for 8 nights last week around Xmas. Our friend paid a little more than us and had a suite with sight over the City, whereas me and my fianc茅e had a crapy room overlooking a construction sight. My advice: ask for the 14th floor, not for the 11th!!! And above all, demand not to be in a room next to the elevator, it can be very annoying! We also had women cries (I let you imagine why...), children screams and construction noise early in the morning.Appart from that, the hotel is a good value, considering its price (unbeatable), the service (very helpful staff, who found us an unforgettable last minute table for Xmas on the Zocalo and was always there to give us a hand) and the position in the center of everything.I recommend it to students with little money like us, or first timers in Mexico City. We had a lot of fun in this hotel and in this amazing and wonderful city.

<Content>the good outweighed the bad All in all, it was an okay stay. Besides discovering a cockroach or two in the lobby of my floor, and the elevator malfunctioning, it was a good stay. The staff was friendly and ready to help 24 hours a day if I had a problem. The food was interesting-- I enjoyed it.

<Content>umm..... This hotel was ok, there were a few problems as an American going here and then to a better hotel, but we came back later in the week. My problem was with the breakfast, things that were supposed to be warm were cold and those that were supposed to be cold was warm... the people were nice, but we got stuck in the elevator twice when it broke down. But the sites around and the city was well worth the little inconvienences.

<Content>The nicest staff for a hotel In the heart of Mexico City is this older hotel in which there is a wonderful staff. The waiters smile and remember your name. The bell boys go out of their way to help. The desk staff are frinedly and work hard to make your stay pleasant. The hotel is quaint. The food is good. The service is better. I have stayed there two times and will again.
