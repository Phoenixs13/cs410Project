<Content>One of the best places ever! We stayed recently at the Mahapala Villas in Sanur. This place is just AMAZING. Sure there are probably bigger, better places or chain hotels on the island but this place just has IT! I've never stayed anywhere that was so well done. The Villas are so beautiful it is hard to leave them every morning. The bedroom door opens out to a blue crystal plunge pool. So private too. great Gym and Pool. The bar looks out over Sinduh Beach in Sanur and is a great spot to start the evening. They have a great restaurant but try some of the nearby spots. There is a very good Jazz Cafe just around the corner. Sanur is a little quieter and less commercial. Has some great beach side bars/restaurants and good art market. OH yes, the staff are very interested in your birth sign/date. everything is zodiac themed - even the cocktails in the bar!
