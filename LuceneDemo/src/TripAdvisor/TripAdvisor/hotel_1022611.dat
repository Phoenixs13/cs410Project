<Content>A wonderful Rustic Private setting A wonderful, private setting in the midst of the rainforest. Searched all web sites before our visit for information and discovered that the only entrance to El Yunque is the north end, 10 minutes down a mountian road from the villas. Carole is a gracious hostess, didn't meet her until after the 1st 2 nights, but were greeted by her canine friends and left the key in the lock. Not a luxury resort, but a wonderful flavor of the region. The outside kitchen became our favorite hangout after a day in the rainforest or at one of the wonderful beaches.
