<Content>Houseboat was OK, Great Neighborhood My husband and I stayed in the modern houseboat during our 3 night stay in August. The houseboat is very spacious. There is a mini kitchen. There are sliding glass doors that open up on to the small canal. Not many boats go by, it's mainly really cute ducks swimming by. I thought it would be a bit more posh but it was pretty utilitarian but still reasonable for the price. Neither one of us liked the bed (two twins pushed together) or pillows. They definitely need to be replaced. I think they are extremely old and worn out. My husband is convinced the pillows made him sick and he refused to use them after the fist night (he has no history of refusing pillows!). Anyway, if there was a new bed and pillows I think we would have had a better experience. The neighborhood is extremely charming. The breakfast provided is excellent and the breakfast room is very cute. I'd say this place is a good value just bring your own pillow!

<Content>Very Nice, Clean And Near The City Center I went to this hotel in april and stayed there for 4 nights....I was with my girlfriend and it was a very pleasant staying I have to say!I booked the hotel calling them from Italy and It was very simple: booked the room, made a bank transfer and then they confirmed the room.Whe booked the MODERN HOUSEBOAT because we wanted a kitchen to make meals on our own...we never had breakfast because we used to wake up very late in the morning..(breakfast is available tioll 9,30!!)The room, which was a little apartment in fact, was vey clean and tidy: no moquette (yeah!!!), a TV, small kichen, a table and chairs...very tidy!Service people were very kind and they also washed us the dishes!!!!They used to come while we were sleeping and I always asked them to come later and they always came later!! wondewrful ( I like to sleep till late in the morning when I'm on holiday)People from the reception were very kind and when we arrived they gave us a map and some tips for our first days in amsterdam..This hotel is quite near to the city center: the day bus stop is a 2 minutes walk far from the hotel and the night bus stop it's 6 minutes far.The neighbourhood is very quite and in the night looks safe...HAd a very nice staying there! Cheap and comfortable, what else????

<Content>Loved the Acacia We stayed on the modern houseboat and had a thoroughly enjoyable time. The Acacia hotel is located in the upscale Jordaan district which is primarily residential. It was great to be in a peaceful and quiet area. Getting into the tourist central parts of Amsterdam takes about 5 to 10 minutes on a bike (essential in Amsterdam).The modern houseboat is clean, spacious and comes with a fridge and stove top. No complaints at all. Once we had our keys to the houseboat we didn't need to deal with hotel management at all, but they seemed friendly  competent. The beds were incredibly soft  comfortable, we wanted to sleep in for hours. (only downside is that the double was actually two singles pushed together, with a tendency to drift apart in the night, but this is a minor quibble).We thought the modern house boat was great value for money and would happily stay there again.

<Content>good location/Bad management I stayed in the modern house boat or half house boat I should stay....It was basic but clean and quite spacious apart from the bathroom who is more like in a boat!Great quiet location...but...the guy at reception was so rude and not arranging that I will not return nor recommend the place. Hotel is a business in whcih you need to please the customers, have great interpersonel skills and not being a moron!!!Breakfast from 8 to 9.30am is a bit inconvenient either if you are there on business with an early start or on a holiday when you want to take it easy

<Content>You get what you pay for You get what you pay for. Don't expect anything fancy. The stairs are very steep so be prepared. The rooms are small and strangely shaped. But the beds are comfortable and the breakfast is good. Since you don't go to Amsterdam to lounge in a hotel this place is really all you need, the price is right and your in a unique old building,in a good location. There is also a market in the street nearby at certain times, although we missed it.

<Content>GREAT DIGS!!! Although pictures on web-site did not match-up with what our accomodations truly were...our stay on the authentic houseboat was marvelous. Clean, clean, clean and every night after a long day out, it was nice to come back to something we considered home for 7 days. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Breakfast was delicious and served quickly. Highly recommend.

<Content>Studio apt is a pit The Studio is on the ground floor allowing street traffic to peer in day and night. The only way to prevent this is to close the dusty red drapes, allowing no light in. Broken chair, ratty furniture, tiny tiny bathroon and rude staff make this hotel a bad choice. Staff are rude, caustic, and unhelpful. Dreadful hotel.

<Content>Hated it Pros- NieghborhoodCons- i'd like to start off by saying ive seen ladders less steep than these stairs. I actually put on my hiking boots and harness before going up them. The kid at the front desk was snobby and rolled his eyes at me. I sorta felt like snapping his neck off. Caution: do not try the white mints in the bowl at the desk, they suck, really bad. I should also warn you that the continental breakfast sucked for the most part, but the orange juice was good and the lady there was nice. Another thing about the breakfast room, it sucks, and it doesnt have enough tables to accomodate everyone in the hotel, which was why some of the people couldnt get it.and now, the room. Incredibly small, and incredibly strangely shaped. Scuff marks all over the wall like someone had ridden up the stairs, came into our room and procedded doing burnouts on the walls with a dirtbike. but this of course, would be impossible becasue the stairs are completly verticle. The bathroom was incredibly small, im going to add that you should look at the plumbing. Also, after you flush, you have to wait about 10 minuites before you can flush again. No, im not exxagerating. We were SUPPOSED to get a twin bedroom. They gave us a small double. The TV was fuzzy and sucked. I never stayed in the houseboats, but they looked as if they sucked.

<Content>Hotel Acacia - Great neighborhood! My friend and I stayed at Hotel Acacia in May 2005. The hotel itself is very quaint. The rooms are adequate yet clean- however the bathroom is quite small. The main attraction is the actual neighborhood. The Jordaan is a wonderful, safe neighborhood with tons of wonderful restaurants and shops. Hotel Acacia is walking distance to all of the major sites.The front desk wasn't overly forthcoming with information, but overall, I would recommend staying at this hotel. Oh - the stairs really are incredibly steep - so be prepared!

<Content>Past Its Prime We stayed at the hotel Acacia in May. We planned to spend six nights in their houseboat but had to spend the first night in the hotel as the boat was booked. The hotel room was on the third floor. First, the staircase was steeper than some ladders I have used. Very tough to lug luggage up the ladder to our room. The room itself was smaller than most office cubicles. The lumpy bed was tucked into a space so tight you could only access it on one side. Think RV type space. Very tough for two people to share. The bathroom was small and very worn. Cigarette burns on the sink as well as cracking and peeling counters overall. The TV was fuzzy and all the furniture was very worn. On the second night, we moved to the house boat. The space was not anything like what their website photos show. You actually only get half the boat, not the whole thing. The furniture was worn, the blinds were broken and dirty. One window pane was actually missing. The floor was old linoleum that was not that clean. The kitchenette consisted of two hot plates, a small sink and a very small refrigerator. No oven, no microwave and no supplies at all. The coffee maker was old and dirty. No filters, no sugar, no salt or pepper any basics at all.Lastly, the hot water heater didn't work. We called the manager and he got it working. That brought the water up to a bout 60 degrees. We left for another hotel the next morning and will never go back. The staff was nice and appeared to understand our disappointment but were not in a position to do anything about it. Very bad experience.

<Content>like student accomodation The hotel Acacia is in a nice area and the staff are nice but if you have the misfortune to stay in the top of the hotel which can be reached by climbing up steep steep staircase after steep steep staircase you are in for a shock. The room was horrible. It was worse than student accomodation that I stayed in in London and that wasn't that nice. Think 70's wall to floor linoleum and lumpy single- small beds. After that climb!!For 65 euro - a single room rate if was a rip off!!To add insult to injury at 10.25 someone came and banged really loudly on my door. I was not happy.

<Content>Excellent Value Hotel! We stayed in the modern houseboat and friends of ours stayed in the studio apartment and we found this place to be excellent. Very cheap for Amsterdam and even better with good breakfast included. Fab location for us (out of but close to the centre) in the Jordaan area where there are actual Dutch people (as oppose to drunken yobs and frat boys!). Lovely market on the Saturday morning at Lindengracht.Accom itself was spotless, warm and comfy. Staff very helpful and knowledgeable. I could not recommend this place more for a stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Highly recommended Based on the prior review I guess we stayed on the traditional houseboat in June (3 nights at 95 euros per night). Very satisfactory digs and a lot of fun--you feel more like a property owner than a hotel guest. The Jordaan is a great part of town--good restaurants and bars without the crowds--and the Acacia seems to attract a nice clentele. The staff, especially young Julian at the front desk, are caring and attentive in ways that you would only expect at much pricier hotels. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Inexpensive, great neighborhood, nice staff I was happy with the Acacia overall. Stayed 2-9 June, 2004. I knew ahead of time that the rooms might be pretty small and the stairs were steep, but whoa... they are almost as steep as climbing a ladder so be warned. And the room was a bit drab but I liked the view of the houses and cafe across the street.But all in all, I thought the place was charming, and the location was really great. A little off the beaten path but not too far away from anything interesting. There are many fantastic cafes and restaurants nearby--the Jordaan is a cozy, nice neighborhood. I think next time if I stay there, I'll try booking the houseboat.

<Content>Slept on the canal Stayed there a few weeks ago on their modern houseboat (there is a traditional houseboat next to it but we did not see it) which had a small kitchen with stove, refrigerator, and coffee pot. It was very large and clean with sliding glass doors overlooking the canal. The beds were incredibly comfortable. The best part about it was that we did not have to climb any steep steps which you have to do in most hotels. The breakfast of ham, cheese, boiled egg, juice, coffee, and bread was good. The location is in the Jordan, an up and coming area which has some great restaurants. It is away from the major canal areas which makes it less noisy and expensive. Everything is an easy walk or tram ride away. We paid 110Euros/night which makes it an excellent value.

<Content>Just OK Pros: In the center (not THE Center though), great neighborhood; charming breakfast room; relatively cheap (the $80 price includes breakfast) Cons: Very Steep stairs! (good luck if you have heavy luggage), tiny room (I didn't see them all), sewer smell on the top floor. The view was not very charming either. The widow with a Canal view was facing a modern apartment building on the other side of the canal. The other window was facing ugly roof tops with junk on them. We tried to keep the curtains closed. Overall it's not too bad for a budget hotel.

<Content>Acacia, good cheap accomodation. We stayed at the Acacia in 2002, its in a pleasant part of the City, walking distance to the centre. Hotel on a corner site overlooking a canal, pleasant breakfast room, extremely steep stairs to rooms, dont even think about it if you have a disability. Basic clean small room in a typical old Amsterdam property with character. Family run with friendly staff. Good locals bar on opposite corner. A good base for a visit to Amsterdam, above average for its price, would stay there again.

<Content>Beware of the stairs, but enjoy Overall I was very impressed w/ the Hotel Acacia. Considering that it only cost $80/ night for a 2 bedroom room w/ private bath, shower  tv. The room was pretty small but that was something I assumed ahead of time. THe beds were very comfortable although frighteningly close together. THe bathroom facilities were fine and the tv was nice because we watched alot of Euro MTv at night/ early morning. Free breakfast every morning is a definite + although I only managed to make it for breakfast once. Just don't expect too much -typical euro breakfast w/ coffee, bread, some meat  cheese. The stirway up to the rooms was scary though. Probably the steepest and narrowest stairway you'll ever see but par for the course in amsterdam. THe staff was very friendly and helpful. Just make sure to pay w/ cash or it's an extra 15% per night. Not a bad walk to the main part of the city either. Overall I give the Hotel Acacia a solid B rating. Can't get a much better deal for your buck.
