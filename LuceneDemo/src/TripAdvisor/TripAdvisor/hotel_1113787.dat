<Content>Love the hotel, but GM seemed a little fake! The hotel is great, from the design to the ambassadors. I never heard of an ambassador program, but these people are a mixture of concierge and front desk. Very good people. I had a specific concern and the GM was in the lobby. I got a strange feeling as if my concern mattered, but it wasn't a huge concern to her. She was fast talking and seemed as if her meetings or other engagments were more important. My wife thought she seemed very fake in her approach to resolve our issues.Just needs to be more genuine and not so luxury! We all love the hospitality, but from a real personality is better

<Content>Joule has become one of my favorite hotels in the US I travel a lot for work and for pleasure, and staying at the Joule reminded this weary traveler that traveling CAN lead to excellent surprises and discoveries.I've stayed there twice now - once in November, once in December. Both experiences have been among my top experiences at any hotel. The first time I was in an upgraded room, and the second time I stayed in a room that was more of a suite, with a sitting area and jacuzzi tub. Both rooms were a joy to stay in -- immaculate decor, extensive light dimmers throughout, $200+ professional hair dryers (the nicest I've ever used in a hotel), complimentary water bottles in the room, rain shower heads, unique coffee table-type books to read in each room and in the lobby, an umbrella for guests to use in each room, etc. It was too cold to swim in the pool or drink at the bar at the pool, but this area looks like it would be a major draw in the warm months. The gym was by far the cleanest, biggest, and most well equipped hotel gym I've ever visited (minus the spa gyms in Vegas hotels -- not really comparable). Charlie Palmer is a home run restaurant, with a hopping bar scene on weekends, fabulous dining fare, and an exceptional breakfast menu.With only minor exceptions, the service was top-notch and went beyond our expectations. Once we had to wait longer than acceptable (30 minutes) on a car to come out of valet parking (other guests who called for their cars later than we did got their cars before us). On the positive side, though, we were greeted by name throughout our stay, assisted with dining reservations, and treated exceptionally well in all other interactions. Hotel staff dress well in pin-striped suits and other dressy professional wear and seem to take pride in their jobs.The downtown part of Dallas where the hotel is located is enjoying a bit of a renaissance, it appears, with more businesses opening but still some empty storefronts. Neiman Marcus is less than a block from the hotel, and several restaurants are in that same block. The Sunday brunch at Iron Cactus was better than expected (and a great deal at around $14 a person, I think it was), and we ate a pricey but excellent foodie lunch at the Dallas Fish Market (less than a block from the hotel) and LOVED it.Count this hotel among my top choices in the US. I would gladly create a reason to go back to Dallas just to stay at the Joule again.

<Content>The Joule is FANTASTIC! We have yet to experience a 5 star or Excellent hotel...being blown away from start to finish, but this came close! The Joule was outstanding. Found free street parking so I cannot comment on Valet, although 4 to 5 guys were standing around. Front desk staff was great. They escorted us to our room, which I could do without. I want to wind down and not talk so they could skip this practice or ask if we would like an escort. Immediately went down for drinks at Charlie Palmers and was greeted by Josh (great guy to talk to and down to earth). This was a good sign. He convinced us to come back and try the breakfast...which we did. as other TAers have noted we came back to four truffles and a bottle of water...nice touch. We were on the 16th floor, great views. We used the exercise room in the morning and were impressed with the equipment and size (largest workout room we had seen). They have water and fruit to take as you please. Pool was closed but we checked it out and it is very nicely done. Next time were in Dallas we will stay here as it has become our favorite hotel in Dallas! Starwoods did a great job picking this hotel up.

<Content>Fantastic Service We just returned from a week-end get away for our anniversary at the Joule. We were very impressed with the service and attention to detail. We were upgraded from a regular deluxe room to a Loft Suite and even received a bottle of champagne. All I can say is.....AMAZING. Charlie Palmers is a wonderful restaurant and also supplys room service. Staff is incredible. Danielle and Gregory were always there for whatever we needed. Truly a luxury week-end.

<Content>Nice otel but bad service We stayed at the Joule for two nights, and the hotel itself is quite beautiful. Our room was very nice as well. However, the service is not where near other luxury collection hotels, but more on the line of a Motel 6. The cleaning services forgot to make up our room, and did not replenish the soap or shampoo. Furthermore, they left us only one bath towel and forgot to remove all their cleaning supplies from our room. I did complain to management and they appeased me with some Starwood points. It is just very hard to fathom such poor service in a hotel that claims to be a luxury hotel. They have a great deal of work to do, so be weary if you book this place now. I imagine most of the kinks will be worked out soon, or this place won't last long.

<Content>Nice hotel but some kinks need to be worked out Went to Joule for anniversary get-away. Brand new hotel which is nice since so many hotels do not update once they are a little older. Very contemporary hotel but classy. We considered Ritz and Mansion on Turtle Creek but happily choice Joule.Service is hit or miss. They had free bottle of wine and chocolates in our room for our anniversary which was nice but I had to ask 3 times for ice bucket (it is small hotel so there are no ice machines on the floors). When I checked out they double billed for the room (once in my name and once in my wife's) and the guy at desk said they had had problems with that happening. There is Charlie Palmer restaurant in hotel but is not owned by hotel. Charlie Palmer cooks the room service menu but it is different menu than restaurant and didn't look as good (no foie gras). We ordered take out from Charlie Palmer and they even provided us plates and silverware. This was nice because we got the food we wanted, didn't have to worry about it being cold and got to watch UT kick Missouri's [----].Location is in middle of downtown but lots of activities close by. Check out Iron Cactus for a drink - they have 3rd story rooftop bar that is really nice if weather is good. Also for the ladies one of Dallas' best spas (Sedona - lady's only) is across the street but make sure and get appointment in advance as my wife couldn't get same day appointment on Saturday. The hotel can arrange for in room or couples massage from Sedona. Also try brunch at Bread Winner's Cafe - just a short 3 miles away. We had dinner at Nobu which is in Crescent Court which was really good too.

<Content>Magnificent Stay WOW! What a hotel! I have never been so spoiled in my life!This is a true Luxury Hotel from the ambience to the amenities to the exceptional staff.My family traveled toThe Joule, A Luxury Collection Hotel for a birthday weekend - it was perfect. Upon returning to our room one evening we discovered a birthday card signed by the hotel staff and gifts on the coffee table? How? What? They are that good at The Joule!!Not one staff member gave us the pretentious, arrogant attitude one sometimes feels when staying at a hotel of this caliber, especially when traveling with childern. Sometimes I feel like a lower class citizen when traveling with my kids at luxury resorts - not at The Joule, they welcome them with inviting arms!

<Content>Lovely experience but... This is an excellent hotel with an amazing rooftop pool and lounge area. I would have nothing bad to say if I had not realized when I got home that the valet (or somebody with access to our car in the valet lot), had stolen a couple of items from my trunk. The staff at the hotel and the parking company (ACE parking) are working hard to rectify the situation, but at $27/night for parking one would hope that her car was more secure than it apparently was. So, one word of caution; empty your car entirely when parking in their valet lot.
