<Content>Avoid this motel at all cost Here's a copy of the complaint letter I sent to the hotel. Their service is so miserable that their e-mail address given on their official website (as listed on their business card) doesn't work!***Hotel: Premier Inns PhoenixI've stayed at your hotels on many occassions. In general I found them clean, comfortable and a good deal for business travelers like me. But I will never stay at your hotels again after my most recent stay at Premier Inns Phoenix. I checked into your hotel and found it dirty, decrepit, and dank. There were two-day old, dirty towels hanging on the bathroom door in my room -- they had been wet when the prior guest left them there and they were stiff and immobile when I picked them up. This is just one sign of the very poor housekeeping. And the bed was very old and very uncomfortable; the blankets were stained and pockmarked with cigarette burns as was the carpet.Of course, I asked for a no-smoking room but I don't understand why you allowed smokers in the next room (also marked 'no smoking'). They stood in the doorway to their room and smoked throughout the day and night that I was there.And several of the businesses surrounding the hotel were out of business when I checked in this time. There's not much you can do about that but it sure looks like a dump with all those parking lots surrounded by chain link fences. It's nothing at all like the mini-resort setting you claim on your website. And that's a shame because I remember how nice it was when I first started staying at your hotel about ten years ago -- it truly WAS a VERY nice hotel in a nice area. You've let the hotel slip into a miserable, cheap motel. Do you really need an arcade with violent video games in the lobby? It was very loud and ugly in there! I should've checked out when I saw the clientele you had playing cop-killer video games inthe lobby!The worst problem though was the miserable staff at the front desk. They must be embarrassed to work there because the several people with whom I spoke at the desk were all crabby, rude, and unhelpful. I was going to mention the several problems I had with the hotel (dirty, loud, smoky, etc.) when I checked out but the clerk just took my keys and walked away saying you're all set as she went into her secret office behind the counter!Again, I remember what a great hotel you once had in Glendale. That's why you'll never see me again.***
