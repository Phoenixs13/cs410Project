<Content>Great Time for a Great Price! I just returned from a relaxing weekend at the Royal Villa, and I highly recommend it. The grounds are lovely, the Deluxe Room (the least expensive offered) was large and clean and poolside (as are all the rooms), the owner was friendly and accommodating. It was a beautiful weekend in October and the pool was never crowded as I thought it could possibly be as they offer day passes. It was never a 鈥渟cene鈥? but a relaxing space to enjoy a clothing optional environment - which is why I chose to try it out. Simply put, I鈥檒l stay there again when I get back to Phoenix, I recommend it and hope you have a great time!!

<Content>LOVED the Royal VIlla I stayed at the Royal Villa for 2 days after a business trip to Phoenix. I loved the room - loved the facility - the grounds were beautiful and everything was extremely relaxing. I plan on returning this winter for another long weekend.I can't say enough for the host/owner - he was helpful - friendly - and I felt that the facility was extremely safe.Some of the guests weren't the friendliest but you can expect that any place.

<Content>Hotel Policy For Memorial Day Weekend, I wanted to get away from home and decided to book a room at the Royal Villa. I went online and placed a reservation via their website. Nothing else happened, no follow up email or phone call, nothing. I thought that I had better follow up and call the hotel directly myself, but was told that they didn't have my reservation but do have rooms available so I proceeded to make a reservation. As I was giving the gentleman my information, he asked for my phone number. I gave it to him, he replied, do you live in Phoenix? I answered yes and he said that he could not allow me to stay there. I asked him why and all I was told is that the owners do not allow locals to stay at the hotel. But they do allow day passes to locals. I was totally confused and bewildered by this. I can understand that maybe in the past the hotel has had problems with locals, but give me a break. I will definately not recommend a place that can not even support its local gay community.

<Content>Nice place Nice place, overall. I've never been to it before and have never been to the other property (before they bought this one). Was impressed. Better than I thought it would be. Room was clean and comfortable. I liked the fact it had a full kitchen (but no dishwasher). Since I dont wash dishes (especially when on vacation). I bought paper plates and plastic silverware from the grocery store which worked just fine.I liked the small area outside the room to sit down and relax. All rooms face the pool. Pool and hot tub were superb! Nice good looking guys hanging out by the pool. Mainly guys in their 30's and 40's. A couple guys a little older but mainly 30s-40's. All guests were pretty friendly. You can sun/swim nude by the pool which I took advantage of. Very nice! To the management: the only thing I would like to see different is MORE palm trees on the property. I only saw two. To vacationers like me from the North: Palm trees = relaxing vacations. More palm trees near the pool area would have made the stay PERFECT.

<Content>We LOVE this place We have stayed at the Villa many times, and I have always found it to be very clean and the owner and employees are down to earth and pleasant and concerned that their guests are having a good time. The grounds are immaculate and tastefully decorated and we always notice upgrades and improvements whenever we go there. The Villa is close to some of Phoenix's hot spots, and it is even possible to walk to some of the clubs. There are lots of very attractive guests staying there from all age groups and each and every person there is made to feel at home. I'll try to go there as often as possible!!!

<Content>Ok resort , rude management/owner A friend and I have stayed there on numerous occasions because we have met some really nice people, same can not be said for the owner/manager. I misplaced the key, and he could have just let me know he was charging me for it, $100.00, but then he had to get rude and nasty about it. He is extremely unprofessional, as he has bad mouthed other guests that have stayed there. His partner who does most of the work around the place has always been very nice and courteous, and as I stated unfortunately the same can not be said for the owner/manager. Take a lesson on how to treat customers, especially repeat ones.

<Content>Enjoy the resort but the owner needs to get a lesson on people skills I ve stayed at the resort on several occasions and have met some great guys.....too bad the same can not be said for Doug the owner. I was there and misplaced the key to the room, and instead of just letting me know that there was a charge $100.00, he called me up and was extremely rude. He takes on his queenie persona, and thinks thats ok. A friend of mine and I have stayed there numerous times and he can t seem to remember us from one time to the next. His partner Kenny has always been very nice and pleasant, whereas Doug has complained to us about other guests, completely unprofessional, and out of line for a hotel owner to do. The quality of service is less than a motel 6.

<Content>Just fair Rooms were a little dingy, could have been cleaner, towels were stained, a/c did not work well. Management offered another room if the a/c did not kick in. It did finally cool off, but the next day it was still a little warm. Pool and hot tub were great. Met some nice people around the pool area. Pool area was in need of some new furniture and more shade. Great concept, but needs a little updating, especially the a/c.

<Content>I will be there again! This was my third time at the Royal Villa and it won麓t be my last. I stayed there for a week and enjoyed the hospitality of the staff/owner very much. The room has everything you need, is clean and comfortable. The pool area is great to relax and meet other guests. A lot of the gay bars can be found just around the corner.

<Content>We'll be back! Comfortable, relaxing, fun. We enjoyed our stay as much as our visits to Warm Sands in Palm Srings. Great pool and jacuzzi. Close attention to detail. Attentive staff. And our Poolside Suite was a treat. These guys know how to run an inn.

<Content>Enjoyed this place This place for men is located not far from the airport or downtown(went to the Heard Museum). There's a shopping mall at Camelback and 16th a few minutes drive away.The rooms have kitchens with microwaves(this is not a bb). The bed was comfy and there was plenty of dresser space. The bathroom was OK. Bring your own shampoo. There are no phones in the rooms(most guests had their own cellphones of course).No computer for guests but there is service for those with laptops.Kenny was friendly and helpful.The best part was the pool and hot tub. It was great to lounge around sans clothes. Very relaxing!The Villa is a good value.

<Content>Best Hottub I've Enjoyed Spend a weekend at Royal Villas. This is my second time. First was at their old place. This place is an improvement from the old one and easier to find. The rooms are larger and the place is very clean. I found the host to be friendly and very hospitable. I could walk to a couple of bars. Parking was a potential problem if it is too full, but there was another lot at the old place. I would definately return.

<Content>Run, Run, Run the other way This place sounds nice and could be, but they need to take lessons in customer service from the guest houses in Key West. The rooms are a little worn and could be cleaner, but some of the staff is very rude to the guest.There are not many all male guesthouses in Phoenix, but I would cross this one off your list!

<Content>Very Pleased I just spent a weekend here and was very pleased with everything. Its an old apartment facility that the owners bought in the last year or two and the rooms have been completely redone. Its one story and all the rooms face the pool in the courtyard. The photos in their website are accurate as to what the place looks like. The rooms are like living rooms with kitchen to one side and beds on the other. My room was comfortable and very pleasant.The pool and jacuzzi are brand new and beautiful! Yes, they look better than the photos on their website. The price is very good for Phoenix and especially for the winter season. It also is very convenient to central Phoenix. I plan to stay there again this winter for another weekend. Yes, its a fun place!

<Content>Great place, clean and modern I had looked at the pictures for the poolside suite and booked it but when I arrived I found the pictures did not do the room justice at all. It was very nice, all new, clean and modern. The grounds, pool and spa were the same. The water fall in the spa was great and it is quite large. Everything was very clean and the owners were great! Will definately stay here again!

<Content>Fun to be naked by the pool The place is very cute. Our suite was large and well apointed. It was built in the 40's or 50's so it's not like a Hilton. It was kind of a quiet week but still several friendly and attractive men were staying there. It was fun getting naked by the pool. I'm one who shouldn't be seen naked but I did it anyway. We had a very nice time. The hosts were great.

<Content>It's OK; Clean and mid-priced The Arizona Royal Villa is a nice mid-priced small hotel for gay men. I don't know what the other reviewer found so objectionable. Yes, it IS in need of an upgrade, but when I was there it was very clean and very reasonably priced (compared to some other hotels in the area). I didn't find it at all hard to locate, but then I had the advantage of daylight and it sounds as if the other reviewer had to find it after dark. Best rule of thumb -- if the hotel does not meet your expectation, TALK TO THE MANAGER. You'd be surprised; they might just make it right or at least assist you in finding other accomodations. The Arizona Royal Villa is all right.

<Content>Awful Stayed here based on their website's description. Big mistake! I should have left when I saw the room but it was too late at night. Very difficult to find the hotel first of all. The room was terrible. Musty, old, and very dank. I must mention I was there in December last year, so maybe this is a summer only destination. But still, there's no excuse for such an old room. It was not cheap! AVOID this place!
