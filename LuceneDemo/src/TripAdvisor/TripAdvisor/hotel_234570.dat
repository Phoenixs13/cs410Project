<Content>Good basic hotel This hotel is great if you want a basic place to stop whilst sightseeing in Barcelona. We stayed for two nights. It is a five minute walk from Maria Cristina tube stop, which is easily accessible from the airport or train station. It is in a slightly residential area with a supermarket, cafe and bank 2 mins away on foot. It is easy to find (the hotel offered directions), although we did arrive late and got lost in the dark when we walked down the wrong street!The room was fairly basic but very clean and had air conditioning. The bathroom was very nice with a good selection of complimentary toiletries and the room was cleaned for us after our first night. The staff were friendly and helpful. The Camp Nou stadium is literally a 5 minute walk away, so very well located if you are looking to visit, from there we were able to pick up the tourist bus to do our sightseeing and got the tube back quite late in the evening with out any problems. Only complaint would be that the walls appear to be very thin, so you can hear people in adjacent rooms, but this didn't really cause us any problems.All in all a great place to stay if you want somewhere cheap and easy.

<Content>not bad Hello, stayed one night in this hotel, a single room. The stricture is ok, the room was quite small but with all the facilities. the bathroom was clean and ok. The WiFi had a good speed. The brakfast was simple but ok . The place is a bit far , a residencial zone close to the Palau Real, about 15-20 minutes by subway (L3) to city center. From the hotel to the closest metro station is about 10-15 minutes walking. My pinion overall is positive. a good place to stay .

<Content>Just what we needed This hotel/apartment was great, we travelled with a child and the place was centrally located to transport, supermarket and there even was a playground down the road that my son loved.This is not the Ritz-Charlton but if you want a good clean basic hotel that provides you with a fridge, cooker etc for a reasonable price this hotel is hard to beat.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed here for 5 nights in August and it was great. It is a 2 star so no major luxury but it was very clean, room cleaned with fresh towels each day, air conditioning and a mini fridge. It was in a great area, although it was a few km's from las Ramblas, there was a Metro station five minutes away which gave excellent access to all the major attractions and the airport. There is a few large department stores very near by. The breakfast was great, just continental but fantastic pastries! Also very nice helpful staff who provided us with plenty of tourist info and maps. Internet access also available in lobby. Would definetely recommend it for anyone on a budget!

<Content>Much better than 2 stars. Way above average!Situated in residential area, 5 minute walk from Diagonal(main city thoroughfair)  metro /tram access. Bus stop  taxi rank right outside door.Small bars/cafes, supermarket, many other shops very nearby.Very nice restaurants/cafes within walking distance.FC Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium only 15 minutes walk away.Tourist Bus pick-up 5 minutes walk away on Diagonal.Room was spotlessly clean. A/C, mini-bar,TV,comfortable beds. Bathroom was faultless, linen changed daily.Did not initially book continental breakfast, however made use of it, at 8 Euros, really good value.Would recomend this hotel to anyone.Light sleepers may hear doors closing, people walking in corridor outside room.Cervesa  vino tinto help eleviate this small problem however!Muy bueno. :-))

<Content>Great for the Footie I feel the need to write a review for this hotel as i have just returned from a one night stay with my son and it was exceptional for a two star hotel!We travelled from England to see a game at the Camp Nou.The hotel is 15 mins walk to the ground in a nice area.I have stayed in far worse 3 and 4 star hotels in various countries.The hotel and our room was very clean.The room was not big but it was adequate.The shower was hot and it was powerful!The reception staff were very helpful and breakfast was served from 7-11am.As a base for visiting Barcelona i cannot fault this hotel

<Content>It is noisy, at least in level 2 .... Ask for upper floors Yes, the hotel is easy to reach by underground, is comparably cheap for Barcelona, is clean, has good breakfast. You can ask for the key to the safe deposit box for a deposit (it is free). The single rooms are tiny but OK just to stay the night (nothing more). And on the way to the subway tehre is a a corte ingles mid-size city grocery open almost 24X7 - great to by snacks, bottle of drinks and the like avoiding tourist prices elsewhere .... BUT: I had a room right in level 2 above reception and kittchen. I woke up every day when the kittchen started about 30 minutes before breakast start, maybe because they spoke so loud with the front desk. Also, shower of next room and people walking above were as load as if you were in there room. It is one of these congrete buildings where the inner walls carry the weight and usually transmit noise easily. Believe me, I have read a lot of reviews about hotels with noise complaints that I considered OK, but this room in perticular was sound-open ... Do not get me wrong: Without the front desk /kittchen noise it may very well be quiet, SO DO ASK FOR A ROOM IN THE UPPER FLOORS, the hotels has quiete a few floors.

<Content>Excellent Cost-Benefit relation Althoug it is a 2-star hotel, we found it very confortable and well-equiped, speccially considering its cost.The people there is very kind and helpful, and the hotel is exceptionally clean and tidy.The rooms, though basic, are quite spacious and have hughe windows to the street, which is not so common in European 2 or 3-star hotels.About the location, although the hotel is far away from the city centre, there are many shops nearby, including a huge El Corte Ingl茅s departament store in Diagonal Avenue. The distance to downtown Barcelona is easy solved by the very good local underground, having a station nearby.I麓d highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to pay a reasonable price and will spend most of his stay enjoying the city and not locked in the hotel.

<Content>Very noisy, Tiny room, treated rudely Very noisy, Tiny room, Rude deskman Review: I remained only 3 of my planned 12 day stay in this hotel due to the fact that I just couldn't sleep. I could hear toilets flushing, showers being taken, doors banging. My first night there, it became so hot in the tiny room, I called the desk to ask how to regulate the heat. I was told that it was winter in Barcelona and I couldn't regulate the heat at all and to open my window. I did. At 3:30 AM people were still outside talking and walking by. I closed the window. I found where there was a knob on the radiator which I turned completely off. It remained in this position until just before I checked out. On morning number 1 and with permission of the guy behind the desk, I was allowed to take my breakfast tray up to my room due to smoking in the small eating room. On morning #3 I was promptly scolded in Spanish by the female dining room worker because I was taking a yogurt up to my room. I felt quite humiliated. When I had to check out because I became ill, the desk clerk was rude. He kept telling me that I was to stay 12 nights. Twice I repeated: I know, but I'm sick and must go home. He stated that instead of the discounted rate I had been given, I would have to pay the full rate of 5 more Euros. I gladly paid it and got the heck out of there. The room walls are paper thin and you can hear everything. If they truly redid this hotel 4 years ago, they really need to add insulation between the walls. I think I read somewhere that this hotel was a converted college dorm. Although clean, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone unless you can sleep though anything.

<Content>Very basic, very clean, very nice! The hotel is only 2-star, but I happened to be at some 4-star which were far worse! Well kept, in a quiet area off the city center, it's no frills but fully satisfactory if you do not expect luxury. Very convenient for shopping and quite close to the subway. I wound up here as the only place I could find in a last-minute business trip at a time when no room was available at nicer hotels. I found it so convenient that I decided to fly my family over and to extend my stay for the weekend. Staff were friendly and polite. A really nice experience.

<Content>A very good two star hotel I had a good experience in this hotel. It is two stars so no luxury, but they get the basics right: tidy room, clean sheets, decent size and equipped bathroom, TV, work desk and air conditioned facilities. The breakfest is basic - cold cuts only - but appropriate. The hotel is 5-10 minutes walking from the Maria Christina metro stop, in the business district of Barcelona. Very nice shopping opportunities all around. It took me 30 minutes to get to the hotel from the airport using public transportation (train from airport to Station Sants and then green metro line to Maria Christina station). Paid EUR 48 per night.
