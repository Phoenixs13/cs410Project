<Content>eunjoy the cnal traffic a lovely place which lived up to all the reviews. We booked room115 on the ground floor and it was a good idea because the stairs are very very steep and we ad heavy luggage. the room has great tall windows and overlooks the canal. The Hotel is convenient to most sights - we walked to the Museumplein for the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseums in 20 minutes.

<Content>Understated canal side comfort and relaxation We love Amsterdam. We lived there for a year almost 10 years ago and like to go back once a year to say hello. So we've stayed in a few different hotels. Amsterdam is an expensive city hotel wise, it's hard to find something decent for a reasonable purse. We've often played safe and stayed at the luxury end in the Pulitzer or the like but this time thought we'd try a budget option and came across Hotel Orlando. We were very pleasantly surprised - we stayed in room 117, 1st floor overlooking Prinsengracht. The room was the width of the whole canal house, 3 large windows letting in lots of light in to the huge room. Ok, the furniture has probably seen better days, beds a little soft, but has charm and is tastefully put together. It feels homely. And even though really it's a BB there is a mini-bar that does have reasonable prices if you just want a little drink in your room.The greeting was extremely friendly, the easiest check-in we've ever experienced anywhere in the world and immediately the room was ours for the weekend. The stay felt very authentically Dutch. Breakfast was fine, hot drinks, bread, eggs and cheese/ham to get you started. There are so many lovely cafes and patisseries nearby you can always nip up the road to get something more substantial if need be, and Amsterdam is a city of food so you'd be wise not to eat too big a breakfast and spoil your opportunity for a good lunch.I found the last review here very strange - opposite of our findings. It was extremely relaxing and very sweet, and beautiful and well located. Did feel like a little look at what it would be like to live in a canal house. I would thoroughly recommend Hotel Orlando.

<Content>A big disappointment My husband and I are just back after a two-night stay at Hotel Orlando and, on re-reading previous reviews of this hotel, we have just asked ourselves incredulously: were we at the same place?On the positive side: the hotel is well placed for seeing Amsterdam, being away from the noise and general grubbiness of the inner city but within easy reach by foot (or tram) of all main attractions. The bedlinen was clean; at least one of the twin beds pushed together to form the double was comfortable; there was a hairdryer in the bathroom and a mini fridge in the bedroom; and the young woman who showed us the room, made breakfast and handled check-out was extremely pleasant and friendly.The negatives, however, were considerable. We had chosen Room 111 because we liked the look (from the hotel's website) of the courtyard outside and because we like fresh air when we sleep (however cold it is). However, the photos did NOT show that the ceiling was so low that we barely scraped in, nor that the so-called courtyard (perhaps photographed immediately after renovation?) was now just a damp, rather dingy area inaccessible to guests (unless you wanted to climb out the window). The bathroom had no exterior window or any kind of working ventilation system so became extremely steamy and was no doubt the reason why the paintwork above the tiled area of the shower recess was dark with mould. The grouting of the wall tiles around the handbasin area was also mouldy and the timber benchtop was showing its age with water spotting.We had read comments on the hotel's website about the tastefulness of the interior decor and were amused to see that this translated into two plastic tub chairs, one plastic footstool, a plastic table, and on the tiny bedside tables were Ikea-style bedside lights of which one was temperamental and didn't always light. There was also a strange lattice arrangement painted bright red (but with the paint scuffed around the base) that housed the mini fridge and the TV. Behind and extruding from this curious item was a huge tangle of white plastic wiring that obviously no none could be bothered to coil up and stow away neatly.My husband reported that his bed was extremely lumpy and uncomfortable. The only items that could perhaps be described as antiques were the bathroom towels which were so thin that they were like rags after one use.I peeked in a vacated upstairs room (I didn't note the number) and didn't see any sign of tasteful decor there either - just the bare minimum of ordinary furniture required to classify as a hotel room.Other Trip Advisor reviews commented favourably on the breakfast - again, to our amazement. The coffee was good and plentiful but the food consisted of a few slices of the cheapest kind of sliced cheese and processed ham, one croissant, 3 small rolls and two slices of dark supermarket style foam bread, small pots of jam and marmalade, and two tubs of supermarket fruit yoghurt. There was the offer of a boiled egg and orange juice but we declined. I mean - OK but nothing to get excited about.If Hotel Orlando has been at one stage as previous reviews and the hotel's own website suggest, then I can only assume that in the interim its owner has lost interest.European cities can be pricey - having travelled to many parts of the world and now living in Germany, we know that full well - but I am sure that 110 euros a night can find you a better option in Amsterdam than Room 111 at Hotel Orlando.

<Content>Beautiful relaxing canal-side hotel Stayed for 3 nights around my wife's birthday, we both loved the hotel. Rooms are large and comfortable, with mini bar, tv, and beautiful original paintings. Spent more time than expected just sitting in the room relaxing.Great location on one of the 3 main canals. Far enough out of the center to avoid the noise and stag-dos, but close enough to walk or jump on a tram into the main tourist areas. Utrechtstraat is an adjacent street with a wide variety of restaurants, both the ones we tried were really good. Lots of shops too.Breakfast is very filling and tasty, can even be delivered to the room. All the staff very helpful and friendly, especially the owner, and couldn't have been more welcoming in a relaxed and unobtrusive way.All in all a really great hotel, and perfect if you just want to unwind and relax.

<Content>Lovely except for the beds This is a lovely hotel with beautiful rooms. I had a canalside room on the 1st floor (2nd American). Fantastic view, and the room was huge. Everything was very clean, minibar was nice to have, and the staff were very kind and helped me get my bag up the stairs, which I needed because I've had a back injury. Which brings me to the only caution I would offer: If you need a firm bed, stay someplace else. I fortunately had a couch in my room, and for the two nights I stayed there I alternated between the couch and the floor. It was a painful experience, but if you don't mind a soft bed, you'll probably love this hotel.

<Content>Great little hotel with huge rooms and lovely canal views We visited Amsterdam for several days and stayed at the Hotel Orlando. We were very happy with the room we booked (117), which overlooked the canal. For the price, the room was amazingly huge, and the neighborhood very peaceful. Amsterdam is a beautiful  lively city, yet we found ourselves spending several afternoons and nights just sipping a drink, looking out the hotel window and watching the boats go by. The weather was rather cool while we were there, and we slept quite comfortably with the windows open.Before heading out to sight-see each day, we had a filling breakfast of hot breads, rolls, and croissants, ham  cheese, an egg, yogurt, and delicious coffee and orange juice. The entire staff was very courteous and helpful. I would highly recommend this place. We absolutely enjoyed our stay here.

<Content>Comfortable, Relaxing, Love the Orlando The hotel is in a really great area. Its a quiet street on a canal, but the large streets near by have a really excellent selection of restaurants, bars and shops. Paul, and his friend who helped out as well, were just great. Breakfast in the morning was a highlight. The hotel has all of the necessities, and the back lower floor bedroom was even quiet during Queens Day. Really private, too.We really enjoyed the hotel and the hospitality.

<Content>Beautiful Accommodation We adored the Orloando. It is located right on the canal and our room was right at the front which looked out onto the canal.Our room was giant with 2 double beds and giant TV and an absoluetly gorgeous bathroom with big bath.The whole place was spotlessly clean and the staff were amazingly kind.Breakfast was great (included in the price) downstairs. Freshly squeezed orange juice, eggs, cheese, spreads, rolls and meat - great way to start the day and lots of information phamplets and guide books lying around to read. We stayed here for 2 days and wished that it was longer.

<Content>Charming, clean and friendly We stayed on the ground floor with a canal view. The room was simple but stylish and very clean. The bathroom was modern and in tip-top condition - lovely! Basic but good breakfast, friendly and accomodating service.Nice location 鈥?central but not busy, and walking distance to some nice shops and restaurants (try out Beddingtons just a street away).Despite the proximity to the street and our room being near the we had two quiet nights and slept vey well. Very good value for money - will definitely stay here again if we come back!/ Alison and Carl

<Content>We will return one day! After much research, we booked hotel orlando and we loved this hotel. I stayed in Room 117 with my parents from July 21-23, 2007. The three huge windows bring the room a lot of light. The decor is classy and make you feel calm and warm. The canal is right outside our window. Paul serves breakfast in the basement, which has custom-made utensils and furnitures. He played opera every morning. He does not speak a lot. But you can tell he is a kind and well-educated person. The woman lives next door to the hotel has two small childen. She waved to us one morning and we had a nice converstion with her. It is the homely ambience that makes Hotel orlando special. I hope I will return one day and stay in room 117 again. Mia.

<Content>We love you Orlando After reading one of the previous reviews I was a little concerned!! Upon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly young lady who took us to our room. The room was enormous and had a beautiful view of the canal. The room was nicely furnished and had air-con. It had 3 enormous windows with wonderful drapes and voiles! The bathroom had both bath and shower. Breakfast next day was good - Bread, ham, cheese, egg, yoghurst, fresh orange and tea or coffee all served by Paul (the owner) who also was very helpful and friendly. We stayed for 4 nights at the hotel in Room 117 and must say it is excellent value for money for it's central position. Our flight wasn.t until 9 in the evening and we were able to leave our luggage while we had a final day in the city. The hotel has only 5 rooms and is a wonderful find thanks to the Telegraph review which I saw earlier this year.

<Content>Not a hotel This not a hotel, but basically a bed and breakfast. The room was huge and very clean. The bathroom was average size, but the towels were pretty thin. While the room technically has air conditioning it really was useless, but the fan made up for it. Breakfast consisted of some bread, cheese, ham and a hard boiled egg - pretty standard Dutch fare. The owner (Paul) could not be more accomodating. The location is very quiet.

<Content>not great! i agree with other reviews. we were told check out was in ten mins time, this was told to us when we were half the way through our breakfast and when i said sorry for half an hour late check out he told me i was rude and not 'his' sort of people! i do not take well to bad manners and thought as a hotel owner it was amazing he spoke to his guests in this manner! the rooms were ok, we did not see a cleaner or evidence of a cleaner for our whole weekend and didnt have any clean towels. i felt the hotel experince was ruined my very rude staff!

<Content>Over rated I agree with the reviewers who noted the cleanliness (or lack thereof) and the somewhat odd or rude behavior of the staff. This hotel is recommended in so many trusted guides including Louis Vuitton! Not by me.My bathroom had peeling paint, mold and stains on the ceiling. The room was dusty as others mentioned and the bed was two twin beds shoved together that seperated easily and made sleeping uncomfortable. I also was awakened by many loud pedestrians outside during the night.The breakfast was a joke. I was asked what time I wanted it and when I told him I could just have some bread and cheese he acted mad that he had even bothered to get up and make it for me. There was no alternative to orange juice and I am unable to drink it. I asked for milk instead and there was none. I was never offered yogurt or an egg.I feel the price I paid was more than was warranted. I think I should expect more for $200/night. I would have preferred a clean hotel with more choices for a breakfast for this price. (Cereal/musli, a variety of juices and beverages, breads, meat and cheese as most offer)I also did not find the staff helpful as to places to see or directions. The praises for the owner I read about I did not see - I think there are two men named Paul - one the owner and one his partner I think the odd one is the partner. I never met the other one.P.S. The room is exactly as pictured by other travelers.

<Content>Rude staff I stayed at Hotel Orlando in March with three female friends.The whole stay was coloured by the the extremely rude and frankly odd behaviour of the only staff member whom we had any particular contact with (I qualify this by saying we did meet one other female staff member who was polite and helpful). Paul (as I think he was called) made us feel like unwanted house guests, everything was too much trouble for him. Our rooms weren't cleaned while we were staying there, the mini bar was disgusting inside and half empty. We were given out of date yogurts for breakfast (which we only discovered after we had eaten them). On the day we left Paul told us we had to check out ASAP as he had to clean the rooms (so it seems some cleaning is done). We had been under the impression check out time was 12.00 but apparently it was 11.00, Paul told us at 10.50 while we were having breakfast that we had to check out at 11.00, so naturally we were going to be running a little late. We finished breakfast and went to our rooms to get our stuff together. Paul then came and started banging on our doors telling us he needed the rooms and was quite aggressive, the whole situation was really uncomfortable. When we came to settle the bill he said we were incompatible and huffed and puffed further. Having worked in a hotel previously myself I was quite shocked by his behaviour, he was thoroughly unprofessional, you don't have to like your customers or be compatible with them, you just have to to your job. Maybe he was having a bad week, he spelt unwashed shall we say and his behaviour was quite erratic. We had one of the bigger rooms and one of the smaller rooms and they were a generally both good sizes, although not very clean and the beds weren't particularly comfortable. The bathrooms were basic but fine. On the basis of the service we received I can't recommend this hotel.

<Content>Weekend Visit Splendid.We were in Amsterdam for a wedding and stayed for a long weekend. We also had the absolutely vast Room 117 overlooking the Prinsengracht. It's super...spacious yet romantic. Nice big bathroom too. Comfy beds and stylish decor.Mandy was warm and helpful and got us hairdryer, iron c. Location excellent. The smallness is an absolutely huge plus. You feel special and as though you have really discovered somewhere.Only very slight negative was that parts of the room including the intriguing TV/Bar box hadn't been dusted and were a little dirty....but that's not enough to detract from my 5. We would definitely stay here again...if there was space.
