<Content>Perfect! The hotel was fantastic and the staff were very helpful! Our room had a balcony at the front of the hotel and overlooked the street below, where there was a great buzz about the area! Our room was spacious and very clean and the bathroom had a huge shower which was very powerful! We could have had breakfast in the hotel which was offering a 2 for 1 deal, 2 breakfasts for 鈧? but we didn't take advantage of this offer because we wanted to walk the city and try breakfast in different places each morning.All in all we have nothing bad to say about this hotel! It's in a perfect location and we couldn't have wished for better!

<Content>Comfortable  Very convenient location - not far from Las Ramblas but on a fairly quiet street. Our room was at the back of the building and was very peaceful.Room modern, stylish  comfortable - large bathroom with huge shower (plumbing a bit noisy though.)Pool very small but adequate for a cooling dip and it was nice to have the option of outside space.Staff friendly.Excellent value for money.
