<Content>City Pension Berlin - A bit of a Surprise! Tried to book a few weeks in advance to stay in Berlin and started with those hotels listed in our tour books or recommended on tripadvisor. The more interesting looking and recommended hotels on this site were booked. We came upon some positive reviews on tripadvisor regarding City Pension Berlin so we took our chances with it, thinking the $$$ was reasonable and reviews favorable. However that was prior to the posting by MSKIM enlightenening all to the fact that the shower is located smack dab in the middle of the room, a standalone, not even in a separate room. Since I am one of two women travelling together we would prefer our privacy and were somewhat taken aback by this.The area does seem a bit dodgy area (some of seedy bars etc) but no evidence of weirdos on the street. The hotel itself looks dodgy from the outside, and dated inside, the reception area looks a bit rough. There is a nice market with fresh fruit just a 1 minute walk from the hotel and the Schloss Charlottenburg was a 30 min. walk from the here. Also there was a reasonable internet cafe just a 1 - 2 min. walk from the hotel. Lots of conveniences with quick and easy access.The room was large, with high-ceilings however there was an occasion we did have trouble unlocking the door and had to solicit the assistance of the staff to help get us into the room. And remember the shower is a stall in the middle of the room with absolutely no privacy, while lying in bed you are looking at the shower stall! While the Charlottenburg S-bahn stop (above ground) is just across from the hotel it was noiseless. As a matter of fact the room was very quiet as well as very clean and functional. We did not book an ensuite but the bathroom was right outside our door and although we had to share it, for the most part it felt private and we never heard any noise of others in the bathrrom when we were in our room. Bathroom itself was clean but dated. Again, for a cheap room, you can live with this.The staff was very friendly and accommodating, which was another PLUS for this hotel.Breakfast was OK - pretty standard for a German hotel, we've had better, but it sufficed and we didn't book the hotel for the breakfast. The hotel is situated about a minute away from a U-bahn stop in one direction and a minute away from the S-bahn stop in the other direction. Charlottenburg S-bahn will take you direct into the heart of Berlin in 10-15 minutes e.g. Hauptbahnhof, Hackescher Markt etc. Truly convenient to access the S-bahn  U-bahn, and a big PLUS for this hotel.While the $$$ was certainly reasonable, I would prefer not to stay here again. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised and I know it could have been a lot lot worse. Not a bad choice if you're stuck or attempting to hold down the budget.

<Content>Shower Stall Right in The Room! If you like privacy taking a shower, think twice about this hotel. We knew the toilet was shared in the hall and the room included a shower and sink in the room. I guess I was expecting a walled off room for the shower, not an actual shower stall right in the room. I traveled with a friend and we were both shocked when we saw this. I'm not really found of having a friend right in the room with me while I am showering. We did make it work, but I probably would not stay here again (unless I was in a room by myself). On a positive note, the room was clean and the location was very convenient with great access to the S-Bahn. Breakfast was nothing extra, but it is nice to eat something and have coffee or tea before venturing out for the day. If you don't mind the shower stall in the same room you sleep in, then stay here. If you like a little privacy, think twice or make sure you are getting an ensuite room that includes the toilet. The staff was very nice.

<Content>Pleasant surprise - could have been a lot worse Trying to book even a few weeks in advance to stay in Berlin on a German bank holiday weekend proved difficult. The more interesting looking and recommended hotels on this site had long been booked up for this popular weekend so we took our chances with City Pension, and didn't expect much. A taxi from Tegel airport at around 11pm cost a mere EUR12 - the hotel was luckily on that side of the city (a fluke!). First impressions at that time of night - dodgy area (lots of seedy bars etc) but no evidence of weirdos on the street. The hotel itself looks dodgy from the outside and inside, the reception area looks quite rough. But the room really made up for these first impressions. Room was huge - large, high-ceilinged and at least three times the size of the average hotel room in any other European capital I've stayed in! The Charlottenburg S-bahn stop (above ground) is just across from the hotel but it was noiseless. The whole room was very clean and functional. The bathroom was on one side of the room but had only a sliding door seperating it from the bedroom - not ideal but you can live with it. Bathroom was clean but very dated and falling apart in places, as was the rest of the hotel. Again, for a cheap room, you can live with this.Breakfast was fine - standard fare in a German hotel - as good it gets anywhere really. The hotel is situated about a minute away from a U-bahn stop in one direcdtion and a minute away from the S-bahn stop in the other direction. Charlottenburg S-bahn will take you direct into the heart of Berlin in 10-15 minutes e.g. Hauptbahnhof, Hackescher Markt etc. This convenience was the hotel's true mark.Would not stay here again if I can help it (would rather stay in Mitte next time - closer to the action) but nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised and I know it could have been a lot lot worse. Not a bad choice if you're stuck.

<Content>useful and very nice hotel It's a very nice hotel in front of Charlotembourg S-Bahn and ideal if you travel from XSL airport (Sh枚nefeld).The breakfast is very good with various meals like cheeses, cold meat, cereals, egss....I think it is ideal foar a long week end in Berlin without a lot of money to spend and wants a good stay there in the centre of town.

<Content>Great location, cheap, and friendly My sister and I booked a twin room with shower at the City Pension Berlin, and were pleasantly surprised with the place. First of all, it's literally right across the street from the Charlottonburg S-bahn stop (2 stops from Zoologischer Garten). Second, it was clean, quiet, and private. After staying in a youth hostel in Amsterdam, it was super-nice to get our own room and shower. In a pension, you don't feel like you have to lock all your stuff up in a little locker for it to be safe; you just put it in the closet. And having a shower was nice - you don't have to run down the hall wearing only a towel. (Note about the shower - you have to push the red button at the shower base for the water to drain.) This pension was cheaper per person per night than our hostel cost us. And to top it all off, the people at the desk are ultra nice, and they serve a quaint yet ample breakfast with fresh flowers and good lighting. Overall, I strongly recommend the City Pension Berlin to travellers who need a break from the hostel scene!

<Content>Basic but adequate, managed well Stayed at City Pension for 4 nights in May 2005 with my wife and girl in a triple room for 99 Euro/night. The Pension website makes clear that some rooms have a toilet and some don't. This was also made clear in the email that was sent to me by City Pension. We took a room with a toilet, and looking at the toilets along the hall, I'm glad we did..........The room we had was spacious, with very high ceilings with 19th century ceiling rose and cornices. There was an alcove jutting out into the street which fitted the third bed so that the floor area was not cramped. A small bathroom was built into a box in the inside corner - very small and basic with sliding door that just maintained a deal of privacy. The bathroom was adequate and cleaned OK each day, but cramped and the heat of the hot water went up and down like a yo-yo.City Pension is clearly used by a lot of Germans visiting Berlin for 1-2 nights. Breakfast was nice, continental of course, with fresh rolls.As we were on the next floor up from the reception area/breakfast area, noise was not an issue for us, but we did note that there was a large internal door between the breakfast area (which can be used as a bar at night) and the bedrooms. This would keep any nighttime noise away from the bedrooms - nice.We liked the TV in the room as it was a normal set (not a hotel special), which meant that it had AV inputs and we could connect up our portable DVD player.Berlin itself is not a particularly attractive city, but well worth visiting for things like the bust of Nefetiti, and the Permagon Museum. Also, take enough time to explore KaDeWe - what a Department store should be.We were on a touring holiday and thus needed to park our car. Street parking in the area is available, and the City Pension can provide (at 5 Euro/night) a card to put on the dashboard entitling the car to park in the street outside. The only problem is finding a free spot - we were lucky in that someone pulled out just as we arrived.The location of City Pension is very convenient, being close to both U-Bahn and S-Bahn stations.City Pension is one of those places that could be an absolute horror, but is saved by the care and attention lavished on it by the managers (owners?). If in Berlin again we would certainly consider the City Pension again, but would also look at other places to perhaps get a different aspect to the city.

<Content>cheap hotel, average position near U-S bahn, quite area around Attention on booking, the wc is not included in your room but it is in communion with other people of the pension. You have in your room only the the shower and the wash-basin.The pension is situated nearly the metro lines U and S bahn, circa 8 minutes from Zoologischer Garten station.Good breakfast and good service, polite person. Clean room.For me ok!

<Content>Basic facilities, helpful staff We stayed in the City Pension for a weekend in July 2004. It was okay, nothing special, but I don't have any complaints.Good points: The staff provided me with very helpful directions and advice of how to get there.It's handy to the train station (aboveground line that goes through Berlin and to the airport).Breakfast was nice, lots of choice and fascinating to observe the other (mainly German) guests.Very secure (buzz to get in).Not so good points:Not very attractive, thin curtains (it's light in summer very early in the morning) and in a very mundane road.Odd and not very private (if you mind about such things!) shower set-up in the room.

<Content>A great budget hotel I was apprehensive about the quality of this hotel at first, after all, only 71 Euros for a double ensuite room with breakfast included? My doubts disappeared due to the friendliness of the multi-lingual staff, the nice clean rooms, and the lovely breakfasts. Excellent location too, only 5-10 minutes walk from the Ku'damm and right near the Charlottenberg train station.

<Content>nice, small hotel I was last week in Berlin and i stayed the 4th time in City Pension Berlin. It is an excellent hotel in Berlin-Charlottenburg. It is comfortable and friendly. Unbeatable location, directly across from the S-Bahnhof Charlottenburg and near the Kudamm Above-average breakfast buffet. The prices are very good for this location!

<Content>High ceilings, big windows. We too were apprehensive when we arrived, seeing the hotel was near a neon-lit strip club, but once inside we loved it.We had a large clean, double, ensuite room for 72 Euros per night. It had grandiose high ceilings, and huge windows to throw open and watch the world go by. Breakfast is included in the price and was delicious - unlimited juice, crusty rolls, cereals, fruit, toast, pate etc. etc.The staff are predominantly English-speaking, very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is central, cheap, clean, and excellently connected by U  S Bahn (metro  overground interlinked rail services, stations for both within 2-3 minutes walk) to all parts of the city.Their reception doubles as a bar in the evening, which can be handy for a quiet drink when you get back.You could not find a better base for your stay within this price bracket - I would recommend it to anyone.
