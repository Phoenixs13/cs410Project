<Content>Perfect place to stay Wonderful location and wonderful accommodation. We had a management suite that was very spacious, well equipped and extremely comfortable. It was a lovely, quiet haven to relax in after a days sightseeing. I would recommend the Mandala Suites to anyone and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Great Experience I am a single female, who travels worldwide weekly for business and several times a year for vacations. I write very few reviews. The Mandala Suites deserves a great review. I was fortunate enough to stay in 2 different rooms the same trip (my flights were cancelled due to a hurricane at home and they helped to accomodate my extra day). Below are my quick impressions.1. Very Clean (I'm in Medical  can be very germ phobic; this is very important to me)2. 1st room on 7th floor was 800sq ft. open and very comfortable.3. Cleaning staff was quick, courteous and reliable4. Front desk staff was VERY accomodating/helpful and always cheerful 5. Rooms were quiet and well supplied6. Showers for a Europe hotel (not always what an American expects) were clean, large, and had plenty of really hot water7. Great location for shopping, the convention center, restaurants and tours. In total, A Great place to stay and I hope there staff receives many compliments!

<Content>Very good value for money Stayed there in september 2008. Rooms are big and at a high standard. The furniture and interior is quite good, considering it is a hotel. Best of all is the location - absolutely the best place to stay in Berlin when it comes to restaurants, shopping and sightseeing. Finally I would say that it is a plus, that the hotel is very quiet.

Staff were very friendly and very helpfull. One of the best hotels I ever stayed in Europe. I recomment it to families and couples.

<Content>Nice room, great location, good price I stayed here in the middle of March and paid $200 per night through a travel website.Getting there: Hotel is located right at the Stadtmitte U-Bahn station. If you come from the airport on the S-Bahn, get to Friedrichstrasse and you can walk 500 meters or continue to use your train ticket to get on the U-Bahn. As long as there is no transit strike, as there was last week, life is good. The hotel is inside a large office building and you wouldn't know there is a hotel there from the street. Once inside the building, walk towards the back of the courtyard to the entrance.Rooms: Very large. It's a suite with a small kitchenette (microwave, fridge, stove, dishwasher, plates, utensils). Tastefully decorated with a separate bedroom. We had a king size bed, which is really firm. Small TV with a couple of English speak channels, but I also got by watching South Park in German. If you are an American frustrated by low-flow showerheads, the shower will be a religious experience. The missus was pleasantly surprised that there was a magifying mirror in the bathroom.Service: OK. They have a breakfast which is about 15 euro. That's a bit rich for me considering the prices I paid for food in Berlin. I believe you have to arrange breakfast in advance. There is a fitness room upstairs which we didn't use. The young women at the front desk all seemed pleasant enough but reception is not 24 hours. They close at 10 most nights and 5 on Sundays. Their English is ok, but I think misunderstood me when I sought to buy a City Tour Card which includes public transit and museum discounts. Apparently, the hotel says that they sell these at reception, but no one seemed to know what I was talking about.Neighborhood: Downtown. You are a short walk from the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag and to the Pergamon Museum. The Ku'Damm shopping street can be reached by subway. There is a Kaiser's grocery store and a pharmacy only a few meters down the road on Leipzigerstrasse and you can buy everything you need there. The grocery is open reasonably late as well.Given prices for a lot of 4- and 5-star hotels in the city, I think $200 a night was pretty reasonable for a suite in the center. They do have an additional person fee which can bite if you are bringing kids. We were extremely happy with the stay and would use this place again.

<Content>Great suite, great price, great stay Our stay was excellent. The staff were very polite, friendly, helpful and welcoming. The suite itself was extremely comfortable, as well as being very secure. The kitchen area was perfect, and had plenty of utensils and tableware. The room was very clean and kept clean throughout our stay.The only area that we were disappointed with was that the linen was not changed during our 5 night stay. I would have expected one change of towels during our stay and that the shower gel and shampoo bottles would have been restocked once used.Other than that, the suite made our stay in Berlin a very enjoyable experience. It was wonderful to have such a large and welcoming space to retire to, after a long day of sightseeing and shopping! I will definitely be recommending the Mandala Suites to anybody who intends to travel to Berlin. For the money, I just can't see how this place could be beat. If you're after the complete hotel experience however i.e. room service etc, stay elsewhere.

<Content>Fantastic value for money For value for money this hotel rates very highly. Huge room that was tastefully decorated and showed no sign of wear and tear. Rooms also come equipped with kitchenette which I guess would be useful if you were here for a longer stay.Great location, located on one of the main shopping streets in the city and only a few minutes walk to the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie and museums.I have stayed at the 5* Adlon hotel before which is a lovely hotel, but if you're looking for a cheaper alternative for a weekend away this is a great hotel!

<Content>Absolutely fantastic We stayed at The Mandala Suites for three nights last week and it was fantastic. It is situated in Friederichstrasse (?spelling), within a short stroll of the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie etc. I chose it because of its close proximity to the fabulous Gendaremenmarkt Christmas market. The apartment was spacious and fully selfcontained. There is no washing machine/dryer in the apartment itself however apparently there is a laundry for guests in the basement of the building. Breakfast is served on the 8th floor every morning. From memory I think we paid around ten euro for 24 hours on the internet, which was far better than the 22 euro we paid for 24 hours in our hotel in Leipzig! At 130 euro per night, it was outstanding value for money and we would definitely stay there again next time.There is an awesome bakery about 20 metres up the road that opens at 7am and sells great coffee and an amazing array of breads/cakes etc.

<Content>Good and central location with minor flaws The Mandala Suites are centrally located at Friedrichstrasse Berlin, the destination of all luxury addicted travellers who are visiting the German capital. The hotel is part of a larger atrium office building and not well known with Berlin taxi drivers - so better be prepared to know the address. Very Small lobby  friendly service. The rooms are starting at 40 sqm up to more than 80 sqm - all with kitchen. No extremly stylish furniture - discreet elegance might a proper description. Comfortable beds, ok--ish bathrooms. No extravaganza. Wireless and LAN costs 10 鈧?a day. The six day access is for 30 鈧?- easly calculation what is the better choice. Connectivity inbound is ok, outbond can be a catastrophy, if you are not only checking your emails on the internet but work with an application such as Outlook, Lotus Notes etc. Room orientation varies pretty much - some are towards the glass attrium, which is a really calm place, others have windows and balconies to Friedrichstrasse (noisy) or attached streets (rel. noisy as well). Breakfast room on the 8th floor has very modern interieur, but - far too less tables. It can easly happen to you that you have to sit on the couch and wait for several minutes to get a table - unpleaseant, when you have time pressure.Buffet is good to very good, extras such as eggs or orange juice will be served at order. Long serving hours for people who like to sleep longer. View towards Potsdamer Platz, Reichstag, Siegessaeule etc. is impressive. Fitness room and sauna available at the same floor. In a nutshell:+Centrally located for business, getting around and upper class shopping+Good breakfast and beds+Possible tricky internet connectivitySolid, but nothing to fall in love with. Will try the Mandala Hotel at Potsdamer Platz or the SAS Radisson next time.

<Content>Great Hotel The Mandala is superbly situated, right in the centre of Berlin with access to two subway lines within a block. The hotel is exceptionally quiet, especially if you have a room on the court. The rooms are spacious and exceptionally clean and having cooking facilities is great for longer stays. The staff is very helpful. The breakfast is superb, if pricey at 17Euros. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but there is a very good Bavarian restaurant in the complex where the food is very good, copious, and reasonable.

<Content>Very well appointed, huge rooms. Fantastic. I can't really add much more than has already been said, other than to add another voice to the positive reviews. I find it extraordinary that this hotel isn't ranked in the top 2 pages for Berlin. Maybe it's because it's more of an apartment concept, maybe not that many non-Germans stay here. It easily rates in my top 5 European hotel experiences, and I stay in 50+ hotels a year.This is a sensational hotel. Rooms are very cleverly designed, incredibly spacious, and comfortable. Room layout, and bathrooms, are very very grand. Everything worked well. Such a refreshing experience. Bar is also very good. I totally recommend it.

<Content>A very disappointing experience When we booked our reservation in February 2007 we were told that the hotel would be air conditioned. Upon our arrival we were informed that our room did not have air conditioning and that there were no rooms with air conditioning available for our entire 5 day stay. Although the room was large and well appointed, the lack of air conditioning meant needing to leave the windows and curtains open at night. Being on the 2nd floor meant that all the street lights were shining through our windows. The traffic noise began at 5:30 a.m. The staff was unresponsive and indifferent to our complaints and we moved to a hotel with air conditioning.

<Content>Wow We stayed in this hotel for the weekend, the place is fantastic. It is located on Potsdamer, which is a busy, noisy place, but once in the suite it is very, very quiet, probably the quietest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The rooms are huge, bathroom is bigger than a lot of hotel rooms, the shower is awsome (I didnt want to get out of it).Breakfast was very nice, the breakfast room is in a courtyard, very bright and sunny.One small complaint is the reception area is a bit badly organised. If you are going to Berlin, stay here, I will be going back.

<Content>Home from home in the heart of Berlin This is not your ordinary hotel. What this facility offers is a large number of suites. I paid 鈧?09 a night for a suite that was bigger than my own flat. It was brand new, with two bedrooms, a sitting room, a wonderful bathroom and a fully equiped kitchen. I also had a nice balcony over a courtyard.If you like bellboys, and room service, and concierges then shoot for another hotel. However, if you are in Berlin for more than a couple of days, I would seriously consider staying here. It couldn't be better located, being as it is situated on the Friedrichstrasse, opposite Gendarmenmarkt. You have some of the best restaurants in town on your doorstep but if they don't tickle your fancy, you have your own kitchen.If ever I go to Berlin (at least five times a year) this is where I stay. But hush, don't tell everybody.
