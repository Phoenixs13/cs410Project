<Content>Nice hotel, good value A good value hotel. Clean and comfortable, breakfasts very nice. Staff very friendly.Only point I would mention is distance from U-Bahn (7mins) and S-bahn (quicker to get to city centre) (10 mins). It doesn't sound far but after a long day sightseeing if I could have been closer to a station I would have liked it.

<Content>Great Location and Service Fantastic location within two blocks of Ku'Damm. Rooms are spacious and clean (no air conditioning so may be very hot in summer but so are all the rest of European smalll hotels). Service is great and the overall ambience is very nice. Highly recommended.

<Content>great stay This hotel offers excellent value for its price. The first time I stayed here I got it recommended by locals. When I had to stay in Berlin for a second time on a low budget business trip (which ruled out the standard hotels such as the intercontinental) I did not hesitate booking this hotel again. It is in a safe, quiet area just outside the tourist area, a 3 minutes walk from the nearest subway station on the kurfursten damm, and about 15 minutes walk to the zoo area. The rooms are large enough to move around (though maybe a bit over-designed), the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are clean and the breakfast very good. There are cheap (non-tourist) restaurants nearby. I think this is all you need. BTW, if I remember well, they don麓t have an elevator. You can get in late using a night key but don麓t forget to ask the location of the electronic lock. In case of a late arrival (my second visit) they wait if you tell in advance.
