<Content>Very Nice Stay Stayed a week here. Very comfortable stay in a well-maintained property. The location was great with dining options galore in the Addison area. The staff was very helpful attending to every small need of ours. The complimentary breakfast was nice as well. The complimentary Wi-fi is a huge plus.Would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Another Great Marriott Property I spent 10 days at this property with my wife and son and have to say it is another good Residence Inn. We picked the location in Addison due to the great eating establishments surrounding the property, as well as the easy access to the Dallas North Tollway and main arteries. The staff was very friendly, from the front desk staff, the dining area staff and cleaning crew. The room was just as requested, a one room suite. I would have rated this stay as excellent but the furniture and carpet were a bit worn. The kitchen did have new stainless steel appliances, and the bed was quite comfortable. The only bummer is that no king size suites are offered at his property (maybe a residence inn policy?). Whether your are on business or pleasure, this is the place to stay. Hot breakfast in the morning, light dinner service Mon-Thur, outdoor pool and hot tub, it has it all. In terms of amenities, the exercise room was quite weak. Only an elliptical machine and 2 treadmills if I'm not mistaken. Overall a good property, would recommend to family and friends!

<Content>Residence Inn - Done Right My friend and I stayed for 5 days in April at this property in order to visit with her daughter and son-in-law who recently moved to the area. We had a two bedroom suite and it was perfect. The hotel appears to have had a recent renovation as all the appliances were stainless and the living room furniture did not show any sign of wear. The hotel is in a business park and therefore caters to a business client - which suited us - though there were also a couple of families.The front desk staff was welcoming and very accomodating and it was a pleasure any time we had to ask directions, etc - excellent and very well trained.The property was well care for and welcoming, The breakfast in the morning was more than one would expect - also during the week there was a big spread in the afternoon.We enjoyed the hotel and the area - so many restaurants and stores and we look forward to returning.

<Content>Excellent hotel for business travelers I recently stayed at this hotel for a 5 day business trip. I found this to be a great place to stay. I had a two room suite which was perfect for such a long duration. I had a full kitchen, living room, and bedroom which gave me plenty of room. Felt kind of like a home away from home. The hot breakfast each morning was very good and very convenient. I did not have time to attend the free meals in the evenings but they seemed well attended.The pool was nice and the hot tub was very relaxing, specially in the cold weather. If you've got kids with you, they have an outdoor basketball court available. The fitness room was kind of small and so I had trouble getting access to the equipment. I also ran into some trouble with my wireless card on my laptop but the hotel provided a wireless adapter kit so I was good to go.This hotel is located one block from Belt Line Rd. which is lined with good restaurants, many within walking distance. Also the proximity to the Galleria and Lincoln Centre made this hotel especially attractive.

<Content>Very Well Done I was a little concerned when I'd read that this was an older property but nothing about my room or the public spaces said old. In fact, I might have guessed this was a newer property. Rooms are spacious and clean. Bath area is spacious and showers are good (though I'm not crazy about the brand of shampoo/conditioner provided at Residence Inns). Mattress is comfortable and bedding is of the better kind. Commercial sprawl from the nearby mall provides tons of dining and shopping choices with a number of highly rated restaurants nearby. Breakfast was very good (hot and cold buffet) and the food served at evening cocktail hours was unusually good (enough to get you by for the evening if all you're looking for is a light meal with a salad).

<Content>Great for the Holidays The hotel, staff, and service were excellent. We were away from home for the holidays, but the hotel made our holiday experience just lovely. Everything we asked for or needed, the staff provided for us quickly and with a smile. Rather than having a blue hoiday, we were able to have a wonderful Christmas celebration, thanks to the hotel and its staff.

<Content>Excellent stay at the Residence Inn in Addison We had an excellent one night stay... our studio suite was roomy... smelled clean... livingroom/kitchen provided plenty of room for the two of us. The queen sized bed was comfortable... quiet room, even though close to the Addison airport  restaurant row... nice layout in bathroom with lavoratory separate from the commode  shower/tub.. water pressure was great... nice showerhead  shower curtain rod was curved so water wouldn't leak out of the tub while showering...EXCELLENT BREAKFAST BUFFET-- offered eggs, sausage, french toast  waffles, yogurt, medley of thawed berries, granola, juices, milk, coffee, tea, pastries  cereal... It is within walking distance to many restaurants  Addison Circle Park. We walked to the park to view the Labor Day fireworks!We will definitely stay here again... the staff were friendly with easy check-in and check out.

<Content>Great place for family, need improvement on Internet This is a great place to stay for both business and families. It's close to restaurants and the expressway. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The breakfast is very convenient, and it really does feel like home. The only drawback is the internet connectivity. The wireless connection is spotty and doing work in your suite is difficult because of it. Also, there was no hard wired connection in the suite, so you are out of luck unless you go down to the lobby.Other than the internet access, I have no complaints! Staff is extremely friendly, and facilities are very well kept. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Oldie But Goodie Gets Updating Addison, TX is a comfortable location when staying in the Dallas area, especially if you book a room at the Residence Inn on Quorum. The Inn is just a few blocks from the Dallas North Tollway. The Tollway runs north to fashionable Plano and Frisco with plenty of shopping and dining venues. It runs south to downtown and the American Airlines Center, the arts distric and Deep Ellum. The Residence Inn is tucked away off of busy Beltline Road between tree lined lanes and office parks. Although the Inn has been in Addison for over 10 years, they recently rennovated all the bedrooms with new mattresses, down coverlets and pillows and fresh contemporary sheets and pillow covers. The Inn has 3 stories and even on the third floor the water pressure in the showers is good and I noticed new chrome easily controlled shower heads.Front desk staff and maintenance workers are polite, helpful and friendly. Highly recommended.
