<Content>Fine stay at the Ocean View After reading these reviews we were not sure what we were going to find at the Vieques Ocean View Hotel, but our stay was more than fine. The hotel staff were friendly, and the hotel was conveniently located near the ferry dock in Isabel Segunda. The room was clean and a good size, with a door that opened onto a sunny large shared balcony. The bathroom was a little older, but for the price, it was completely fine. Vieques hotels seemed to be pretty pricey, and this was one of the cheaper places, and it was what we expected: No frills, but clean and fine. Also, It was nice that a cooked-to-order breakfast was included in the room price.

<Content>So bad we left and asked for our money back. Where do I even begin... I booked a room at this hotel blindly because my plans changed and I needed a place to stay. It was inexpensive, and my husband and I figured How bad could it be? Yes, it can be that bad. The room was worse than a prison cell. At least in prison they can hang up photos. The walls were various shades of beige, grime, and mold. And completely bare. There was a bed in the middle of the room and nothing else. The windows were broken. The bathroom was last updated 50 years ago, and I was afraid to take my shoes off in the room. We had to wait for the cleaning lady to finish before she let us in the room, and I saw only towels in the laundry basket and no sheets, so I'm not entirely sure they change the sheets after each visitor. There was a random door opening up to a balcony that looked over the nasty, noisy street below. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. We left and found another place to stay in Esperanza, which even though it cost us twice as much at least we didn't inhale too much of whatever mold was growing on the ceiling. The only bonus was leaving- they gave us all our money back. Words cannot express how bad this place was.

<Content>horrid... just horrid This place is a dump. The room smelled so stongly of mold that I couldn't stay, but my husband had to use the restroom, so I was in the room a minute. The walls are a mixture of old panelings, all of the furnishings were ancient and the whole place looked dirty. The closet doors were old and metal. Then my husband came out of the restroom. He had to flush three times before his turd would go down (sorry to be gross), and the towels were sticky. Perhaps they had been dried in the salt air??? Overall, disgusting. Anywhere else is better. We left regardless of whether we got our money refunded or not.
