<Content>Awesome service, great rates! Can't say enough good things about this hotel. It is brand new, only opened a month and was excellent.The staff really makes this place excel - the front desk staff are some of the most friendly and helpful I have encountered in my extensive travels.The rooms include everything you need to be fully self contained. There is even an ice maker in the room! The grocery buying service is a real blessing...If eating out is your thing, there are tons of restaurants very close and the hotel shuttle can take you to Dolphin Mall and its many eateries.Just a great place to stay and minutes to the airport.
