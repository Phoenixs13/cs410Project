<Content>Brief Stay at the Hilton Gardne Inn This is a very well maintained property. The room was very well furnished with wi/fi kitchen including sink microwave refrig. The front desk was very pleasant. This hotel is maybe five minutes from car rental return near the airport.

<Content>Very pleasant staff My first impression of this hotel was one of friendly, competent staff. I called upon arriving at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to inquire about the shuttle schedule and the availability of my room for early check in. The staff member on the phone answered my inquiries in a friendly, efficient and professional manner. Even the shuttle van drivers are friendly and seem to be looking out for the well-being of their guests. Upon arrival to the hotel, I was greeted promptly by smiling desk clerks greeting me by title  name. My room was ready as requested, despite the fact that I arrived late-morning. My mini-suite was well-appointed and clean and it was located, as requested, away from elevators, stairwells and other high-traffic areas. The only downsides to my stay were: a) Painfully slow Wi-Fi b) Small (standard 12-passenger) shuttle vans that are difficult for some adults to get in to and out of and c) the seedy part of town the shuttle vans must traverse to get visitors from the airport to the hotel and back.

<Content>Great Location and Great Value I recently stayed here and it is probably the best hotel I have encountered in the Phoenix Area. Now if you are doing business on the West end of town this maybe a little challenging but if you have business either downtown, Chandler, or Tempe; this hotel offers a great value and great location. The rooms are a little cramped but you wind up with a separate bedroom and kitchen/Front room. I don't know what the individual was talking about being loud on the highway side as you would have to have superman's hearing to hear the highway. The insulation must be great because I did not hear a thing, including activity in the hall, the only time I heard someone was when they slammed the door. The breakfast was great and was cooked to order it is not free but you can get a deal that includes it in the price. I was so impressed with this location that I will be staying here again.

<Content>Nice, Clean Hotel This was a very clean, nice hotel. My room on the third floor was renovated with a flat screen TV and a new bed. This hotel looked brand new. The outdoor area wasn't resort like, however the large pool was much nicer than your standard pool. The airport was also very close by.Overall, nicer than I expected.

<Content>Great location, rooms redone, loud on highway side.... This HGI is very close to the airport. My room was recently updated with nice work area, flat screen TV, kitchenette, new bedding.... very nice. Room service was great - I asked for something a little different than was on the menu (shrimp instead of chicken with my pasta) and it was no problem. Water pressure was a tad low in the morning. I had an even numbered room and heard quite a bit of traffic noise through the night. Even with that, wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Comfortable stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Finding a relatively inexpensive yet nice place to stay near the airport for a quick stop in Phoenix is a little challenging. I ended up staying at the Hilton Garden Inn and was pleased with my choice.The shuttle service to and from the hotel is quick and easy. I called the hotel from the hotel courtesy phones at the hotel and within ten minutes the driver had picked me up. The trip back to the airport was just as quick, with scheduled service every half hour. I came down about 15 minutes early and the front desk person was willing to have him make a special trip, although I told her it wasn't necessary.Check in/out was rather simple as they had all of the information they needed before I arrived. The front desk clerk greeted me by name (we spoke earlier to arrange the shuttle) and continued to do so for the rest of his shift, which was a nice touch.The rooms are quite spacious, with a small kitchen area (mini fridge, microwave, sink), living room, and sleeping area. I noticed in another review that they had a flat screen television, however, my room did not. The room was clean and decorated in cheery yellow and blues. The sofa was a little worn, but I didn't spend a lot of time in the room, so it was not a big deal.There is a business center available 24/7 with free internet access, so you can print your boarding passes before heading to the airport. The pool area was nice with fresh towels placed on the lounge chairs. Several other chairs and tables, both in the sun and shade, were also available.As a HHilton rewards member, I had a letter and a small gift of thanks in the room, as well as vouchers for two free bottles of water. I left the gift but did quite appreciate the water, just make sure to drink it before going through security at the airport!

<Content>Good Stay, Despite Bumps in the Road OKay, now yes granted the hotel is nicely located only a mile from the airport.There is another hotel right next to the Hilton Garden Inn and a Waffle House right out the front door to the Hotel.The Pool Area is Nice, Despite some cracking along the pool water area. A good size fitness center and a nice restaurant staff.However, here are the bumps in the road.I came in on 6th of August and tried to check-in however no rooms were available so i asked the Front Desk since i'm a Gold VIP that i would like an upgradeable room if available. I was told they were sold out for the night.So, i decided to check the hotel website to see if they really were. To my dismay, the hotel had a number of different rooms available for the night. So i had to cancel my original reservation and rebook at a higher rate for a better room than what i would of had.I stayed in Room 226 a One-Bedroom Suite a nice room, however turning on lights in the bedroom can be quite tricky and they had to come exchange one of my lights since it wasn't working right.Check-Out was a breeze and directions given were great.Though, i probably wouldn't stay at this hotel again.

<Content>sleepless in Phoenix I have been a fan of Hilton Garden Inns so booked a night here before flying out the next morning. Even though I am a Hilton Honors Silver I seem to have been given the worst possible room in terms of location. The room itself was nicely designed and decorated. The staff was very friendly. However we were on the first floor within 25 feet of a Waffle House restaurant. All night long there were motorcyles revving their engines. Also we could hear extremely loud hip hop and rap music from the cars that were pulling into the Waffle House all night. We travel often and this was without question the most sleepless night we have ever spent in any hotel the world over!Also there was water leaking through the recessed light fixture over the tub at 3am when the person in the room above took a shower. This was in room 104. I think this room never should have been assigned as this is a definite hazard. Overall a nicely decorated and friendly hotel, but not a place to get a good night's sleep!!!

<Content>Great Hotel and Close To The Airport Traveling to Phoenix on business I always try to stay near the airport and I-10...the Hilton Garden Inn is close to both. Great rooms, very spacious with a small kitchen (small refrigerator, sink and toaster), living room area and separate bathroom (there is a door).There are a couple hotels near this property, but this one always seems to have a good price for the room. There is a Waffle House in front of the hotel, which is, well, a Waffle House. If you go over the interstate heading south, there is a McDonald's on the right.If you are looking for a few more dining options, head over the interstate then left on Broadway and head to Tempe/ASU.

<Content>Very comfortable Our room was great value--spacious, well-laid out, and comfortable. The bed was extremely comfortable and the lighting was attractive. This HGI serves dinner as well as breakfast. The staff were friendly and check-in was a breeze. Close to the airport and rental car returns. The only downside was the noise outside our room from the pool area of the neighboring hotel.

<Content>Hilton Garden Inn Dirty Dingy I booked a king size room from a AAA review, staying at this property for one night prior to a fllight. Upon arrival we were given a room on the second floor, the hallway,carpeting and elevator was showing signs of age. Upon entering the room we noticed the air-conditioning was not working, the front desk was prompt in reassigning us to another room. This room was showing wear and tear. The carpeting was dirty as were the drapes and windows. Upon retiring for the night, when we turned down the sheets both the bottom and top sheet were DIRTY. The front desk sent up another sheet (which was rumpled and dingy).When we cheked out the front desk just shrugged and said sorry 'bout that When we asked to speak to the Manager I was told he was not available. Please beware if you book a room here, It is not up to Hilton standards. AAA should reevaluate it's rating.

<Content>Easy to find and enjoyable to stay I spent nearly a week at the Garden Inn traveling for business. The hotel was extremely easy to find, only one exit down on I-10 from Sky Harbor Airport and close to ASU and the mall  movie theatre in Tempe.The staff was extremely courteous and personable, as I would expect from a smaller hotel. The restaurant was adequate, I found breakfast to be the best part of dining there at the hotel.The room was clean, well appointed and spacious. They offered both wired and wireless internet access to suit anyone traveling with their laptop.The cost was a bit pricey but I think it's definitely a matter of getting what you pay for.

<Content>Nice, minus the theives Not a bad hotel, nice high speed internet in room, and good shuttle service that will take you to restaurants, ect. Unfortunately I had a watch stolen from my room (with the do not disturb sign on- I did not even get maid service). The management was not at all responsive to this (I guess they hear it all the time.) That is why I cannot rate this hotel higher. I don't like having stuff stolen.

<Content>Excellent for the price Excellent for the price. My room had a sitting and kitchen area!! Great for a low-cost weekend stay. The pool, hot tub, and exercise room were clean and well kept. Staff were friendly. I plan to stay here again when I return to the area. The only negative is that the bed was not as comfortable as some of the (much) more expensive hotels I have stayed in, such as the sheraton.

<Content>Ok For A Quick Stay The Hilton Garden Inn Airport in Phoenix was ok, but I stayed here just after staying at the Hilton Tapitio Cliffs and this room was more expensive and not nearly as nice. The room itself was very nice, but the bedding was not of the usual Hilton quality and my room smelled like it had once been a a smoking room. The air conditioning system was also very loud and I ended up turning it off so I could go to sleep.
