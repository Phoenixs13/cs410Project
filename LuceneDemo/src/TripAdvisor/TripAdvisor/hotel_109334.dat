<Content>A good value We were visiting Dallas for the 4th of July, and we needed a conveniently-located, reasonably-priced place to stay overnight. The bed was outstanding, and the sheets were of a higher quality than expected. The bathroom fixtures looked dated, which surprised me. My research showed that this property was either built or renovated in the late 1990's.The free wifi worked well, and there was no code required. The free breakfast wasn't as good as what is offered at the Hampton Inn, but there was a waffle iron that produced waffles in the shape of Texas and microwaveable sausage/biscuit things.I have stayed in places before that had curtains thick enough to block out a supernova. This property has bright exterior lights. If you are sensitive to light, bring a sleep mask.We didn't use the indoor pool, but it looked like the guests who were in there were having a great time. Some other guests were having a good time, too, while I tried to sleep. The sound of folks running, jumping, and slamming doors transmits quite well from floor to floor.Overall, I feel I got my money's worth. The room was spotless, the check-in was fast, and the stay was pleasant.

<Content>Nice and Quiet Attended a family reunion. 9 adults with two young children (1  4). Total of 5 rooms. Very quiet and clean. Everything worked. Kids enjoyed to indoor pool. Central to everywhere we wanted to go. Staff attentive. Only negative was high humidity in corridors. Highly recommend.

<Content>This is an excellent hotel! We have stayed at this Fairfield Inn six times, the most recently in September, 2006 during a househunting trip. We have never had a bad experience there. The front desk staff is always accomodating and pleasant, the rooms are clean (love the queen sized beds), and the pool area (an indoor pool) is very nice! The location is also very convenient - you are 10-15 minutes away from Presbyterian Hospital, Plano, Northpark Mall, and Garland/Mesquite. And the room rates with AAA discount are always an unbelievably good deal. We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Better than Average for a Moderate Hotel My family (2 adults, 2 kids) stayed for one night at this hotel on the weekend. It was very clean and comfortable with some nice extras - for example, the bathrooms are roomy and the matresses seemed to be almost new - the pillows were actually comfortable and plentiful - and the room included a nice breakfast. Would definitely stay here again - great value for the money.

<Content>Courtyard Lite This is one of the better Fairfield Inns out there - one might even think they were staying in a Courtyard by Marriott by the layout, comfort, and service. The front desk staff were very friendly and courteous. There are a number of eateries in the immediate area, from fast food to family fare. Upscale restaurants in places such as Addison are only 15 minutes away. Although quite close to the freeway and busy streets, the rooms are still quiet. Beds were comfortable with nice, crisp sheets and fluffy down pillows. The property has free wireless HSI (there are no wired ports in the rooms). There is also a desktop terminal and laser printer in the lobby. Overall, a very good bargain.
