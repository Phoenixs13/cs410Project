<Content>Excellent Value, especially location Central location next to Placa Catalunya and close to Las Ramblas, Metro, buses, and many Barcelona highlights.Rooms were not spacious, but clean with very nice baths and showers and the staff were always helpful and understanding of English.

<Content>Top spot! Nice looking building looking over the Plaza di Cataluna. First rate rooms, excellent en suite (unlike many Barcelona hotels, the bath is a decent length). And off season it was really good value for a 4 star hotel -only 鈧?0 per night.

<Content>Central Location Centrally located hotel which is in a side street off Placa Catalunya. It is not on the square as described in some websites!Rooms are spacious, simple and clean. Not luxurious but adequate. Separate toilet and shower/sink rooms. Room service very good. More of a three star than a four star hotel but fine for a visit to Barceklona for a few nights. Staff were always courteous and helpful.Didn't use breakfast facilities as I thought it was a bit expensive at 14 euros per person. Plenty of other options for this outside.Would use again but not if you are looking for a bit of luxury to your stay.

<Content>Central-simple-nice This was a nice hotel for the price. It is centrally located near the Plaza. It's simple but I wouldn't say it's 4 stars, as it's not polished.The photos on the website were not so accurate...but the room was still nice, just not as nice as the photo.I would stay again, as it was clean and nice.

<Content>Great Location, Simple and Friendly Hotel The hotel is a simple 4 star (actually 3 stars in my opinion) located smack in the middle of the Plaza Catalunya, Barcelona's tourism center. 5 Minutes walking from Las Ramblas, 10 minutes from the Barri Gotic (old city), 20 minutes from the Segrada Familia Cathedral. Subway station is nearby, maybe 3 minutes walking. Bus to the airport is also nearby about 2 minutes walking.The hotel is simple, with a small lobby. Rooms are large and adequate and face the street which can be very noisy at night. Air condition, TV and other amenities work fine, but the room still seems very simple.The staff are extremely friendly and take their time explaining everything in detail.

<Content>Great location, comfortable room The hotel is in a great location. Less than a minute's walk from Placa Catalunya (where the airport bus begins/ends) and only a couple more to Las Ramblas. It is also very handy for the Exiample area.Our room was spacious, much more so than many European hotels we have stayed in. Both room and bathroom were very clean. Staff were friendly. I would stay here again on a second visit to Barcelona.

<Content>Split decision We stayed at the Husa Barcelona from May 20 - May 25th 2007.For the price of the room you expect a doorman to at least help with the bags...nope. The front desk people were friendly enough and helpfull with tourist information although the morning front desk mananger seemed to have a really bad attitude most days. It was really nice that the hotel offered breakfast each morning from 7am-11am free of charge. Great location to all shops and La Ramblas (great tourist walk).The bad part was the room. It looked much better in the pictures on the website. You could hear the people on the balcony clear as a bell in your room. The doors are pretty thin as well. Oh and don't let me forget the bed bugs. From the first day to the last they got worse. My arms were eaten alive. I really didn't know what was bitting me at first because it was one or two bumps. By the end of the week my entire forearm was a mess. Upon checkout I told the front desk person and guess what.. for the first time it seemed they didn't understand english. Word for the wise when traveling remove all covers from the bed and request new ones. All in all not a bad place to stay.

<Content>Great Location Not having been to Barcelona before, I had no idea where to stay but this location turned out to be perfect. The room was fairly small but looked out towards the square where all the open top tourist buses depart from. It was also within walking distance of several of the Gaudi buildings, La Rambla and the old town. Rooms were clean and staff were helpful in giving us directions to a local supermarket so we could buy some food and drink to enjoy in our room as we arrived late and didn't feel like going out the first night. Fairly basic place to sleep but definitely worth it for the location.

<Content>Location good, otherwise only ok I stayed a few nights at the Husa Barcelona with my hubby. The room was spacious, on the top floor, with a nice little balcony. The decor was very neutral, your average hotel style, didn't make an impression. The biggest problem was the bathroom which smelled damp and mouldy - it was an extremely strong smell, which really had an effect on the atmosphere of the room. In the end we decided to change hotels.The lift didn't always work but I'm not complaining since walking the staris is good excersice :)The breakfast was nice, you'll be ready to tackle the sights after it.The service at the front desk was friendly and we were always greeted with a smile.Husa Barcelona is located right in the city center on a quiet side street. It's a walking distance from almost all the interesting sights and there's a metro station close by. Check out the small bar right opposite the hotel if you want to stay away from the really touristy bars :) No English was spoken there but don't worry, you'll get your point across!Barcelona is such a wonderful city with so much to see that you won't be spending much time in the hotel, so locationwise I'd say go for the Husa but if it's atmosphere you're after - forget it!

<Content>Good location We liked this hotel,(24-28 March 2007). It's so well located near the top of La Rambla, we walked to the cathedral, Casa Battlo, Casa Milia, the sea, Palau de la Musica. The staff were pleasant  helpful  spoke English as I'm ashamed to say we only had a few words of Spanish/Catalan between us.We were on the 7th floor  our rooms had outdoor terraces with chairs  tables. Our friends in 707  710 had a good view over Placa de Catalunya but we had asked for a quiet room so were put further along the street, away from the busy square. The double glazing was good so the rooms were quiet . They were comfortable  clean with a pleasant breakfast room.There was a buffet of fresh  tinned fruit (this could have been a bit more imaginative),4 types of cereal, yoghurt,cold meats, cheeses, breads, hard boiled eggs, scrambled egg, bacon  sausage, various delicious looking croissants  pastries.So plenty of choice.We'd have used the terrace more if the weather had been warmer,as there's a great market about 10-15 minute walk away off la Rambla so you could buy lovely fruit etc. If your room doesn't have its own there is another terrace with tables  chairs on the 7th floor.It was a good base  we got the 4th night free, booking with Expedia. We'd certainly consider this one again if we go back  there's lots to do  see that we didn't have time for.Do look after your money  cards in Barcelona. Our friend who travelled separately from us had her purse taken from the bottom of her zipped-up bag that was over her shoulder, at the bus station as soon as she arrived. At the police station she met someone else who had her bag taken when she put it down to get her case out of the bus,  at the hotel was someone else who had something taken while she was out. My neighbour had her bag snatched from off her shoulder last year. It's worth having a bag or camera on a long strap that can go across your body  you can hold it on the front, with the opening on the inside.I had small amounts of money in different zip pockets in my bag  in a body belt,  didn't take a purse. The hotel room had a safe, 10 euro returnable deposit for the key.Don't be put off going to Barcelona though, hope you have a lovely time.

<Content>Very central located, but not that great We stayed four nights in the Husa Barcelona. We had great expectations because of the pictures presented online. However the room was quite disappointing. The furniture looked very cheap. All in all we hadn't a comfortable feeling staying in the room. However the air condition worked perfectly, the bathroom was new (except the hairdryer), and the windows didn't let in the noise of the street. But above all the friendliness of most of the personnel should be emphasized. The concierge and the chambermaid were really helpful. And of course: The location of the hotel is great. In case you want to get home at night and don't get a taxi (which really was kind of mission impossible for us), you can take a night bus to Plaza Catalunya.

<Content>Excellent Location We have just got back from a mini-break , 3 nights in Barcelona. When we arrived at this hotel the staff were helpful. We were welcomed and given our key to our room. Our first expression was this wasn't a 4 star hotel. The size of the rooms were spacious enough, the decor was a bit let down. The bathroom and W.C was separate. The hotel maids were very good, cleaned rooms everyday, clean towels available everyday and also changed our bedding in the duration of our stay. The location was excellent as it was very accessible to the centre of catylan square and fanstatic shops located near by. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. We had arrived by taxi as we weren;t sure of location, but travelling back we took the Airport bus which is literally few minutes walking distance from the hotel and it only cost 3.75 euro's per person. This was our second visit to the beautiful city and I can say the location was perfect. We had breakfast booked separately which we stayed for one morning. Many choices available. The beds were comfortable but we found it was it abit noisy with traffic late at night and early in the morining which woke us up. There was a mini-bar available but no coffee facilities in the room. Not to worry as there plenty of coffee houses located near by, and one across the road. There is also a theatre across the road, we were lucky we had a room with trees giving us privacy from the bright lights. I would recommend this hotel for it's location and average cost 拢70 for the night.

<Content>Good hotel, Excellent location We spent 5 days at Husa Barcelona hotel for a family vacation. The room was big enouch with 2 beds combined to a double bed and one bed for the child. The room was clean and the bathroom was well equipped. We had a nice balcony facing the street and a minibar that we did not use. On the downside there was no English channel on the TV. Even the CNN was in Spanish, and a coffee maker in the room could be a nice addition. The breakfast that was included in our rate was just excellent. It included 3 types of fresh juice and a nice choice of hot drinks. Eggs, bacon and sausages, a selection of cheeses and cold meats, vegetables and fruits, cereals and excellent morning pastry and cakes. The staff was very friendly. On top of all that- the location of this hotel, right at the Place de Catalunya, is just great. It is a minute of walking from many good restaurants, bars and shops as well as a metro station. Very convenient to take a short rest after walking down Ramblas avenues. We would certainly recommend this hotel to friends going to Barcelona.

<Content>Good Value, Good Location  I don't know what some people expect, but I found it excellent value for money. We paid 拢516 for a twin room for five nights - it was recommended by a travel agent - a proper travel agent not just one who hands out brochures.We were a bit surprised at the minute size of the reception area having looked on the web site it looked quite spacious. One of the young men behind the desk took our cases - perhaps because we were two ladies on our own - put them in the lift and we set off to our room.The lighting system is rather eccenric, every time we turned something on we turned something off, but it just amused us.The bathroom was small with over the bath shower and vanity unit with a big mirror and excellent lighting - handy for make up etc and a hair dryer.A plus point was the separate loo and bidet across from the bathroom, very rare for a hotel of this size.It was just a minute from Placa Catalunya with buses and Metro close by plus El Corte Ingles department store which to us spoiled Londoners didn't have any of the style we are used to.We asked the receptionist on the first night to recommend a restaurant fairly close by and he suggested one about 20 years away which was excellent Catalan food. He didn't give us a card or tell us to say Jose sent us so that he would get a kickback.The breakfast was very good with plenty of choice of breads, cakes, cereals, jam, honey, ham, cheese even olives! Tea was a bit weak but we had taken the precaution of bringing a few English tea bags with us. There was bacon and scrambled egg for those who have to have the hot breakfast.On the morning of our departure we struggled down to the mezzanine level with our suitcases - one of the guys came out from behind the desk and said we should have left them in the room and they would have fetched them later. he luggage room was full, we went back after lunch to get our bags, they ordered a taxi for us and took our bags out to the taxi.We did wonder on our first evening where the bar might be, but as there was a very nice little bar bang across the street, it didn;t really seem to be a problem. They have conference facilities there - maybe the bar is opened then.We seemed to have had a totally different experience from others with the staff, but the Spanish are a sort of insular race they are not like th Italians who always want to make a fuss of you.Another point unless you are paying top dollar you are always going to find city hotels in Europe small - I have stayed in dozens of hotels all around Europe and for value for money and pleasant service - I would rate the Husa Barcelona quite highlyPerhaps some times if you approach the staff in a courteous way they will be more courteous and helpful to you.A FREQUENT TRAVELLER LONDON

<Content>central - not more I can only say the same then I read before, it's not a 4 star hotel. It's a middle 3 star hotel.The area at Pl. Catalunya is perfect.My room was small and the TV has no german channels.If you get a good price to stay there it's ok.Last time I was also in some other 3 star Hotels in BCN, they were better.

<Content>Location, location Location is the only thing this hotel, as a four star hotel, has got going for it. After budgeting our way around Europe we decided to stay somewhere a little more posh to end our trip as we were flying home from Barcelona. I've stayed at 4 star hotels before and the facilities here were most definately not 4 star. We booked through the tourist office at Catalunya Square when we arrived and got the last minute price of 120 euro per night although they wanted to charge us 170 euro for the second night.The rooms were clean and quiet but the lighting was hilarious. If the bathroom light wouldn't swith on, you'd have to go over and turn on the bedside lamp, then go back and hit the bathroom light again. It was a game of lottery as to what light would come on when you hit a switch.One thing that really annoyed me was that having booked a double room we found that the bed was actually 2 singles pushed together with seperate blankets. I echo other reviewer's comments about the mysterious bar/restaurant. I looked around before asking at reception where the bar was only to be told there wasn't one. Why on earth would you have a sign saying bar  restaurant on level 1 if you haven't got one???Location brilliant, staff unhelpful, rooms a theme park. Who hands out the star ratings in spain? If you can get a bargain price, consider it but if they are looking for anything near 170 euro, forget it.

<Content>Ideally placed In terms of the facilities this is not a 4 Star hotel, I think it may struggle to get 3 Stars in the UK. However if you can pick up a good deal then it is in a great location. Whilst the decor is basic the rooms are of a good size and ours had the toilet seperate from the bathroom which was useful. The air conditioning was very good and combined with the higly sound-proof glazing allowed for some lazy lie-ins.The staff were friendly and efficient in their jobs. After one of my companions came in slightly worse for wear one evening he was trying to get the night porter to teach him some Spanish. The next day there was an envelope waiting for him with print outs of a number of handy phrases, which we felt was a nice touch.It was a bit disappointing that the bar was of the imaginery kind, but considering most places are open into the small hours anyway it wasn't a huge problem. There is also a cafe/bar just over the road which is ideal for a quick drink (and much better than waiting for people in the slightly cramped lobby).I would certainly still here again but wouldn't pay any more than the 拢70 per room per night that we did.

<Content>Great Location - not a 4-star hotel though The HUSA is rated as a 4-star but was nowhere near the quality of the other 4-stars we stayed at in Spain. The rooms are a bit dated, but clean and fairly spacious (note that almost all hotel rooms in Spain are larger than the other parts of Europe). We also had a huge balcony, more of a deck with table and lounge chairs. Unfortunately, they were redoing the front of the hotel so there was scaffolding.The lobby is tiny and you have to walk up a few steps to it - not a big deal but somewhat annoying. You also had to drag your luggage up more stairs to the elevator - also, no bellhops, which is surprising for a 4-star.That said, the location is excellent, about a block north of the Plaza Catalunya, on the quieter side, which is nice because Spaniards are total night owls. The Metro/Renfe is across the street making it easy to access all sites and the airport. If you prefer walking like us, you can pretty much walk to any major site within a half hour.We don't spend much time in the hotel so it was fine. Barcelona is much more expensive than other Spain cities so $200USD night wasn't bad. I'm pretty sure I could find a better deal if I looked harder but the city was quite busy that week for a convention.

<Content>Great Location - Good for the Price Stayed for three nights and found the central location of the hotel excellent (just off the Passeig Gracia). The room was very clean and the service we received was fine.Room was fitted with everything you'd expect, ie, minibar, shower and bath, toilet and bidet, wardrobe etc. Decoration was on the sparse side, but considering the low price of the hotel this was fine by us. We also had a small balcony, which not all the rooms possess.The room had a safe, but you need to ask at reception for a key - this isn't automatically supplied.In response to other reviewers' comments, breakfast is not included in the room rate, but this is fairly standard in Barcelona. Also the complaint about the lack of tea and coffee making facilities is really unwarranted - I've never been in a continental hotel that DOES have these, it's more of an English tradition!Overall, it wasn't the most luxurious hotel we've ever stayed in, but for a city break it was fantastic, as you're out of your room for most of the time. There's plenty of coffee houses, bars, restaurants and nightlife on the doorstep and the metro station is literally 25 yards away (although you can't feel it rumbling underfoot!)

<Content>Disappointing to say the least... The location of the hotel was great, pretty central to everywhere you would want to go in Barcelona. The hotel itself seemed promising until we entered our room. The room was pokey to say the least and of a fairly basic standard not what you would come to expect from a 4 star accommodation, although it was very clean. There are no tea or coffee making facilities and we couldn't find the mini bar, let alone the REAL bar as advertised, because there wasn't one!!Be sure to check that your breakfast is included with your room when you have booked as this may induce a costly oversight, although they were of a good standard they were certainly nowt to rave about, as were the staff.By all means if you are looking for a hotel central to it all and just a bed for the night ( not a particularly comfortable one, i might add) this is the hotel for you, if you were hoping for a little bit more luxury from a hotel, don't bother!

<Content>Great location but everything else was not so good... We stayed for 3 nights from 26 Dec 2004. The location of the hotel cannot be faulted, only a few minutes walk from La Ramblas and the heart of the city. But, we had read this was 4 star (ok, so self rated should always raise a question I guess), and from first impressions this was clearly not the case. The lobby is tiny, but there again, who needs a big lobby, so long as the rooms are ok. Check in done, we get the lift to the 5th floor.The halls and stairs are all marble, but once in the corridor, and then the room, this changes. The first thing we noticed in the room was the odd layout - starting with the double bed with one side against the wall. The bathroom was ok - good size, good shower, and fairly new, but why was it built so as to mean the bed was shoved into this cramped position?The decor of the room was tired, and the walls made of an extra thin rice paper so that when the maids started cleaning at some godforsaken hour in the morning, you got to hear every sound. Not much noise from outside - good glazing - but lots and lots from inside!There is a sign on the wall in the lobby to indicate a 'bar'. We looked; we didn't find. We asked; the receptionists looked puzzled and said they weren't sure if it was open (and didn't say where it was), but said we could get a meal in the restaurant. We went up again, and waited. And wandered about, and waited some more, but no-one ever came. We left and went out for tapas...Overall, we were disappointed. We got a fairly good deal on the room online, and maybe they save the old 5th floor rooms for the penny pinching Brits! Wouldn't recommend and wouldn't stay there again. But if you do, make sure they don't put you on floor 5!

<Content>Great Hotel I've spent a vacation at the Husa Barcelona on September 12th, 2004 for four nights. The Hotel is located very near to the Catalunia Plaza which is the center of Barcelona. My room was large and nice decorated, and the breakfast was great.Very good hotel.

<Content>Great location Spent Sept 8-11 at Husa Barcelona - pleasantly surprised to see that hotel located right in the middle of everything, next to Placa Catalyuna by Ramblas and near Gaudi's famous houses. The breakfast was also very good quality. Nice place and terrific location.
