<Content>On no account think of staying here We booked this room on the good review given to it by Time Out Amsterdam Guide. Sad to say that the Time Out review is inaccurate beyond belief.We were charged 121 euros a night for a room that resembled a homeless shelter. Once i had payed the first night up front (i should have known something was wrong when they asked me to pay by sending my bank details by e-mail), they had us over a barrel as they offer no refund for a room booked less than 30 days in advance. We looked at the room and we left!!! 拢400 for nothing, with no recourse to get our money back.Where to start.... the fragrence of urine in the hall, the unidentified stains on the bedding, the mould on the shower, the paint peeling from the walls, the dirty towels.

<Content>Dont Go To The Belga My Husband  I were off for long weekend We had NEVER been to Amsterdam Before...We were BOTH very excited about going  Celebrate Our First wedding Anniversary. The Reviews  Pictures from on-line sources were not very accurate! We did spend Time checking out The Belga, but had NO idea How bad this Hotel truly was.Our Room was On Incredible slope, and I guess was weird to say the least while being a wee bit stoned...lolThis should be Under name of Cheap Tacky Hostel.. In fact There are Cheaper, Cleaner  more friendly Hostels In Central Amsterdam!There were Holes In bed covers...And I was bitten many times by mysterious Wee Critters.FOR $100 euros Per Night Per Room.... we were Ripped off Big time.It will Not put us off going back to Amsterdam, but next time Not to The Belga:)Just glad we found Cafe round the corner Rockland serves great cakes  coffee..The Staff  customers were All Lovely People hope we see you soon! ---We'll Be Beckfrom Mr  Mrs Dallas

<Content>Great Staff but needs a clean  We have just returned from a 4 day trip to Amsterdam for Queens Day. We visit Amsterdam 2-3 times a year and also stay in budget hotel accomodation so we know what to expect. We booked the Belga as we had looked at it on the websites a number of times and thought we would try it for a change, we had read a number of reviews, some bad, some good. On arrival we found the location of the hotel to be excellent and found it with no problems at all. We arrived very early that morning, therefore our rooms were not ready but we were allowed to leave our luggage in the reception area until our rooms were ready so we would not waste our day. We experienced 3 different members of staff during our stay and all were very helpful  polite. There were 6 of us (3 couples), we had two rooms on the first floor and 1 on the third. The hotel was in desperate need of decorating and the curtains  bed throws were filthy with stains especially the room on the 3rd floor. There was only 1 shared shower, which we had to share, even the room on the 3rd floor. We advised the staff 2 days running that the bulbs in both the shower and the toilet had gone but these were never replaced during our stay, therefore we showered in the dark. Also our bed was held up with crates as it had no legs. Overall - Great location, lovely staff but rooms need decorating and cleaning.

<Content>our experience of the belga hotel We stayed at the Belga hotel for my friends birthday and booked a basic room with no shower etc, however for the first night we were upgraded to a triple room with a shower.The room was a little shabby (big patches of paint had fallen off thewalls!) and the bathroom tiny, but it was very clean.We had to vacate our room the next day, but weren't really bothered about that - the maid moved all our belongings to the next room, which was at the top of some very steep stairs!The second room was tiny but adequate and again clean.The shared shower was fun and games as you don't really have anywhereto put your clothes in order to keep them dry and you can't really put them on without getting wet!!I ended up going back to the room with a top on and towel round my waist!!With regards to the heating - we sussed that it was generally switched off, but you could turn the radiators on in both rooms by adjusting the thermostatic valve, however it then got too hot and we had to turn them off!!The breakfast buffet was basic but fine - different breads, gouda andmeat. Also crackers, jam, pate etc and cereal. Fruit juice and hot drinks also provided.I was a little concerned about security as the front door was always open and our second room had obviously been broken into before as the door frame was all patched up! however we didn't ever feel unsafe.The location was very good and was quiet, although unfortunately for us there was a large very loud group of american girls staying, and the walls are very thin!Obviously the hotel can't do anything about this, but if people come in late you can hear doors slamming as you have to pull them hard to shut them properly.We went to the smallest pub in amsterdam a couple of times - just off dam square - the staff are very friendly and the drinks reasonably priced - i would def recommend it!Overall the Belga hotel was a pleasant experience and fine for what we wanted, if you are expecting a posh, modern 4 star hotel - you might want to stay somewhere else.Any questions feel free to ask

<Content>seems to have new management The Belga, our wonderful hotel that we have been staying in for 12-15 years has turned into a disaster . Its a small 10 room place in a great location at a very reasonable price. The location is still great but the two wonderful sisters who ran it for years seem to have vanished and the the new managment appears to be kids - either 20 something's or teenager boys who spend all their time watching the video cameras newly installed in the halls The shiny new cameras are an interesting update considering the rest of the mess. Interesting that security is such a concern to the manager since the hotel has an separate outside door on the street that goes up to the room and the manager disabled the card reader when it had a continuous malfunction so it was essentially wide open for days. Its always been a little shabby but clean; still shabby but with dirty windows, dirty curtains, grimy walls, dirty bedspreads, filthy carpets with obvious and recent food stains . The broken toilet paper holder presented a real problem since the bathroom was tiny and it featured the shower that drenches the entire bathroom; the toilet paper was always a bit damp - not to mention the 20 watt light bulb over the tiny sink (good thing I don't wear makeup). It was chilly in Amsterdam and our repeated request for heating never produced any, although one radiator did get slightly warm one day. But the absolute capper was the freshly dead, oozing, partially eaten dead mouse right in front of the breakfast buffet. The young manager that morning kept carefully stepping over the mouse until I requested that he remove it and he did but not with any good will. And, since Amsterdam was 100% booked for a convention we couldn't move but God knows I did try. And, be aware that they charge an additional 5% when you use a credit card , fair but not always disclosed when you book a room. It all makes me very sad since this has been my favorite hotel in Amsterdam.

<Content>The Belga is all you need The Belga is a family-run business comprising a cafe with a small hotel above, although the hotel has a separate entrance.We enjoyed our stay and found that the good things outweighed the not-so-good things. Other people have said that this is basic accommodation - and it is - but they keep it clean, give you fresh towels daily and there is plenty of hot water. We had an en-suite room, which was fine, but the shared facilities didn't look too inviting.The best thing about the Belga is the location, near Dam Sqare, Anne Frank's House etc., but in a lovely quiet street with no disturbance at night. The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was fresh and plentiful - we found that we didn't need lunch. If you want problem-free accommodation in a great part of Amsterdam, for the price, this is absolutely fine.

<Content>STAY WELL CLEAR OF THIS PLACE VERY NOISY VERY DIRTY well ive just arrived back from amsterdam where i stayed at the hotel belga for three nights im not quite sure where to start the rooms were dirty with cracks in the walls bed sheets were all ripped and burn holes in them the desk they had in the room had been broken and repaired by stevie wonder . theres no toilets in the room or shower everything was on the landing outside shared with all the other guests.i used the shower once when i was there wich was filthy the shower curtain was mouldy and very worn.on a night it is impossible to get a nights sleep the noise is just unbeleivable not only from the guests coming back in at all hours of the night but the guy who works on the desk he had music playing all night very loud. the keys they give you are like acredit card wich you have to pay 20 euros for wich you get back at the end of your stay beware they dont work all the time twice we had to get the guy to let us in the room second time he took half an hour to let us in made us wait untill he was free.next time i will be staying somewhere else i advise you to do the same as you will be very dissapointed try the heart of amsterdam or the dam straat hotel this was my third visit to the city and it wont be the last sorry hotel belga but definetly not a 2 star hotel i would rate this as a hostel more than a hotel not good for couples or the elderly as there are no lifts and the stairs are very steep. the breakfasts were very average tea and coffee were in flasks not fresh and if you like ham sandwiches for your breakfast then your in luck.all in all there are a lot of hotels in amsterdam wich you can choose from for the same money take it from me put the hotel belga at the bottom of your list.

<Content>Give it a Miss!!!! Just arrived back from 4 days at this hotel and would not go again. It is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at, the only good thing was the location, near Dam Square. On arrival, there was no hospitality we had to ask how to get to rooms, not friendly at all. The first room we were given did not have wardrobe or even drawers in it and was at the front where it was noisy. After asking to change rooms we were given a room at the back and altho had a pleasant outlook onto a garden and a built in wardrobe it still had no drawers. Bathroom was tiny just enough for toilet and shower that sprayed all over it. Towels were thin and I have thrown out better bed spreads in my time. Think they must have been trying to save on electricity all the bulbs were dim which made lighting difficult at night . Was just a glorified hostel, which is ok for perhaps students on a budget, but if you can afford a bit more, dont stay here.

<Content>I agree with all my fellow travellers Having read all the reviews for lots of hotels in Amsterdam I started to despair that we would ever find somewhere to stay. Once I read those of the Belga Hotel I was so relieved that noone could think of a single bad thing to say.And we totally agree. There is nothing bad to say. It's a great hotel, very helpful people, with a lovely breakfast, plus having a fantastic location. Very near Dam Square, but not hearing people passing duirng the night.I am so grateful to Trip Adviser for helping us to choose a hotel.

<Content>FOR the love of GOD DO NOT stay here We stayed in this hotel for a week- The only good thing about it was its location. We booked this place through laterooms.com. I am on my O.E from Australia I have stayed in many accomodation styles from around the world. I swear this is the worst place I have ever stayed in.1. Some of the staff could learn more about hospitality2. The room was small and dirty3. The bathroom was small and terrible!4. I went to breakfast on the first two plates i picked up crusted food was still on it5. There are two cats running around the hotel the hall way stank of cat urine6. The cleaner cannot clean properly.7 I would not recommend this hotel to anyone

<Content>Good value hotel. Me and two of my female friends was staying at the hotel Belga on Oct 5- Oct 7 2006. Having read people's reviews on trip advisor about this hotel, we decided to go ahead and book it, as we found the price reasonable (shared between the 3 of us).Once we were there, we were pretty happy with the location. Our room was a good size with a double bed and a single.Having inspected the bedsheets, it seems pretty clean, so we were very happy with it. Bathroom was small, and it could do with better ventilation, but based on what we paid for I think the hotel is pretty good value, and I would definately choose to stay there again. The cafe provided good food too and their sandwiches are lovely and sold at a reasonable price.A good hotel for those looking for a clean hotel and for those on a budget! Location is 5 min from Dam square.

<Content>Good Value, Great location. We stayed at the Hotel Belga for 2 nights in OCT/2006.Hotel Belga is ideally situated, a 5 minute walk away from Dam Square, in the pretty Jordaan area. The hotel itself, though not very comfortable, is good value for money. It is close to tram stops and the Anne Frank museum.We had booked a quad room, for four of us. The room was tiny without much walking area, but since we weren't anyways spending much time in the room, it wasn't a problem.The sheets and towels looked old but seemed clean. We had some problem with the lights not working the first evening, but it was attended to promptly by the staff. The toilet however was claustrophobic without any ventilation / exhaust.Breakfast consisted of cereals, bread, jam/butter, juice, tea/coffee, cakes, scrambled eggs and fruit, again quite sufficient if not the best.Once again, the best part is the location and the accessibility. Also, the lady in charge can do with some smile.Please note that Credit Card payments attract an extra 5% surcharge which is not very evident in the Accomodation Voucher.

<Content>Good value for money I booked a double room in the Hotel Belga for my friend and I to enjoy Amsterdam for three nights in July.Because we were on a budget, we went for a room with no ensuite, which came to 252 euro for the room for three nights.The hotel itself is situated on a little side street about 7 mins walk to Dam Square and 10 mins to the Red Light District. It was well situated for local restaurants - I particularly recommend Il Panorama, an Italian cafe just 2 mins down the road.The reception area had a small cafe-like area and two very friendly cats. We were given a pass card for the front door and our room, which was on the first floor up a steep (but not too bad for Amsterdam standards!) flight of stairs. The decor in this area was basic but clean. Our room was a small double with a washbasin, two chairs, desk, bed and built in wardrobe. It was again basic but clean. The toilet was in a small understairs cupboard just outside the room and the shower was down the hall. Both communal facilities were perfectly adequate and very clean.Overall, we really enjoyed the stay. If you're the sort of person who spends hours in their hotel room, you probably wouldn't like the Belga. But if, like us, it's just a base for your weekend, it'd be great. The hotel's best feature was its staff - they bent over backwards to be helpful and looked after my friend's and my bags for the day before our flight, and even my boyfriend's even though he wasn't even staying there.

<Content>Nice.clean and great location We stayed at hotel belga for 4 nights. When i first walked in i was gobsmacked the room looked terrible the colours didnt match but on closer inspection it was found to be clean and tidy. We had the room right at the top and the stairs were steep but the view was nice and it gave us something to look at.Didnt think much to the breakfast but im a bit fussy anyway. The staff were ok too. Would definatly recommend this hotel for the location and the cheapness. Would stay again for sure..

<Content>Enjoyed the Stay When we got there our rooms were not ready. They let us keep our bags there so we could site see a little bit. When we returned we had something to eat (breakfast and lunch is served downstairs). You also get a discount on food if you are a guest. We then had to walk up 2 long flights of stairs... Once we got to our room it was clean with 3 beds and a window that opened. The bathroom (shower and toilet) were in a bathroom room and the sink was in the room. The security was great, you had to have a card to get into the hotel. Agree with the spring doors but they closed after you so you knew only guests were in the building.The two sisters who run the hotel are very friendly and helpful. We had breakfast downstairs every morning and the bagels are yummy. From our room we could hear them laughing it was a great sound. There are little things I could complain about but just the overall experience staying in Amsterdam in a central location made it all worth it. The only thing I can say is if you are looking for bell hops and room service don't stay here. Thank you ladies for a great stay and awesome bagels. Remember the Beef Stew!

<Content>small and neat The room was tiny but very functional. It was clean and tidy and i didn't detect any bad smells as another reviewer did - and I'm very sensitive to smells. Helpful, friendly staff.It was in an excellent location, central and in the western canal belt which i found to be one of the most pleasant walking areas in Amsterdam.My only complaint is that the doors in the hotel all had those springloads on them which made them slam noisily shut, not great when you're trying to sleep at 2 in the morning.

<Content>Needs Some Work The hotel is spartan at best. First, the good things about HB. The location is awesome. It's nestled in a very walkable neighborhood roughly the same distance to the Jordann and the City Center (Dam Square). The hotel was actuallly pretty quiet by European standards. Now the bad: While it was not winter when we visited it was still pretty nippy at night. The heat either did not work or took forever to start. The staff, well they are helpful to a point. Somewhat condescending for lack of a better term. I asked for recommendations about the neighborhood and it was if they worked somewhere else. Lastly, the bathroom was in need of a shower door. I always hear stories of how expensive water is in Europe. You would think they would save some water by not having to wash towels because the shower has no door and you have to wipe the water off the drenched floor?

<Content>Cheap and basic Group of 14 travelled to Amsterdam for a stag do and settled at the Belga!Location, about 15 mins walk from the Central station, or a 10 Euro taxi ride.The hotel in itself was generally ok. Rooms basic (bed, tv, table and chair). Shower and toilet also in room. Beds were comfy, if only for the few hours sleep that we had.If one thing, the rooms were very cold and most people slept with jumpers on because it was that bad!Hotel is more than ideal for a group of lads, but if taking the lady, best to pay that little bit extra and get somewhere more up market.

<Content>Belga, could be better We booked the hotel on the web, expecting that the price was the best we could get in Amsterdam at that time of year. The Hotel is vary basic. The toilet and shower are in the same tiled enclosure, the bed linen had burn holes in the covers and the Hotel dining area stunk with cigarette smoke.We stayed one vary noisy night and then found an excelent hotel for less than we were paying at the Belga.If the hotel cut their rates by 40% then I would say that it was OK for the adventurous student. But, for $300. a night it was way over priced.

<Content>Small but clean, friendly and cheap I live in Amsterdam but was living temporarily in London and stayed here often when I would make trips back as it is in my neighbourhood. For the money you get a very central location, genuine friendliness and reasonable comfort. A nice basic and always very clean hotel in the heart of the city at a good price, and the fact that there is a separate entrance to the bedrooms means you can come and go as you please.

<Content>Great Location, Lovely Hotel We stsyed at the Hotel Belga after a recommendation by as friend. After an easy booking process, through the web, we recieved e-mails from teh owners with clear directions, and an outline of the facitilites etc.The hotel was easy to reach from the airport, we got the train to the centre and tehn a tram to a few roads away from pour destination. The hotel is abotu a 3 minute walk from Dam Square, we couldn't have asked for a better location from which to explore the city. The hotel was clean and all the staff were really friendly (and spoke great English, which was a great help to our non-dutch speaking party! The rooms were speacious, and the buffet breakfast was great - a selection of cold meats, bread, cereals, and gorgeous scrambled egg, which set you up for the day.There was no problem with rolling in at 4 in the morning as you have a key to the hotel.We plan to go back to Amsterdam again in September and will stay at Hotel Belga again.
