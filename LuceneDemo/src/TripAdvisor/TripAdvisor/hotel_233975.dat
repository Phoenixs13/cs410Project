<Content>Decent Hotel for Short Stays Only Booked 2 double rooms for a weekend stay in Berlin for ourselves and my parents visiting us. Was pleasantly suprised to be upgrade to the Suites (both rooms). This was in the 14th floor. The rooms was huge with an attached kitchen and small eating area. Nevertheless they were musty and smelt of having not been occupied for a long time. The hotel is close to the center of West Berlin. We travelled by car, so was not a problem with this. We avoided the expensive breakfast as there are some nice cafes in the surroundings where one can have b'fast for half the cost. Overall satisfied for the 2 nights and 3 days we spent in Berlin

<Content>Horrible! I stayed in the hotel for 1 night and I can tell you that it was horrible! I had a single room with a single bed. The bed was so tiny that I couldn't turn. I did not sleep the whole night because of the noice from the streets. The windows are really thin so you hear constantly cars, people etc. etc. It was 19 C that day but the room was like 30 C. There is NO airco so it was way too warm! My room smelt very dirty and the interior is really old. Berlin is a great city so dont let it be ruined by sleeping in this horrible place. I would not even recommend it to my worst enemy...

<Content>Lovely place, pity about the staff Stayed here for a few nights at the end of a trip that had started in Estonia and made it's way through europe from there. Our flights were very cheap and we had previously been staying with friends so we splashed out on this hotel instead of going with the usual hostel or budget accommodation. Even though I loved the hotel I did feel that we weren't as welcome there as you would expect:When we arrived they tried to charge us a more expensive price than the one we had agreed when booking and after a bit of arguing and the print out of our booking confirmation they finally backed down however they were then very strict about getting payment up front off us even though they had my credit card details. The waiting staff in the breakfast room were rude and on one occasion when we came down for breakfast they refused us telling us that we had already had breakfast that day and again we had to argue the truth before they realised that there was a mistake on their records. Despite all of this I'd still give the hotel 4 out of 5, as the rooms are beautiful, clean and spacious and the breakfast was delicious and had such a great selection. The location too is great (very close to the Zoo) and allows you to reach all the top attractions by the nearby train station (the public transport is great in Berlin).Berlin is a great, and the rest of the Berlin people we met were lovely!

<Content>Still a good place to stay This is the fourth time I have stayed at the hotel and it is still as friendly as previous visits.I booked directly with the hotel and received an excellent rate of E57 per night including breakfast. The breakfast is excellent, plenty of choice and eat as much as you want. I will concede that the room I stayed in looked tired and in need of an update but it was still clean and comfortable (albeit the bed was a little soft). The location is good, ok it's not in the Mitte district but it is easy to get just about anywhere using the 100 bus connection.As far as safety is concerned, Berlin is a safe city by and large and the hotel reflects this - if you have valuables, for peace of mind, LEAVE THEM IN THE HOTEL SAFE! It is free and only a returnable deposit of E10 is required.As I know Berlin quite well, I decided to do two day trips from the city, one to Dresden (beautiful) and to Szczecin in Poland (not so beautiful but interesting nonetheless) - both are about two hours away. Train travel is easy and relatively cheap, so both trips are convenient using Berlin as a base.One thing I did learn and might interest the history buffs - the hotel is on the site of Adolf Eichmann's Nazi HQ. Look at the 100 bus stop by the hotel for a history lesson.

<Content>Not bad hotel - Berlin is lovely ! Let me just say that Berlin is a a lovely place for a weekend break, it exceeded my expectations ,its modern , clean and so handy to get around on the trains or bus . People are generally very friendly and the hotel is only a ten minute walk from the Zoo and many bars and restaurants . The hotel itself is fairly unimpressive , rooms are adequate and functional - the beds are so comfy I didnt want to get up ! - but its very reasonably priced so its great for the price I enjoyed it overall .

<Content>good hotel in a good location Just back from a 5 day city break in Berlin and we had a great time, found the hotel (pronounced zoolterhof) in venere.comGetting there from Schonefeld Airport was quite easy ,and enjoyable, the RE7 express to the station at the zoo and then the bus 100 (3 stops)right to the door of the hotel (fare 2.10 euros each from the airport!- magic!We were made to feel very welcome on our arrival - I was a bit embarresed by not being able to speak German, but everyone could speak EnglishOur room was on the 5th floor , nice and bright ,spacious and clean, we liked the little bag of Haribo Bears on the bed each evening.We did not eat at the hotel as I had heard breakfast was expensive , instead we had breakfast at a local cafe /take a way just round the corner and also at a kiosk at Wittenbergplatz station about 400m away. For dinner we discovered a great local restaurant 2 streets away in Bayreutherstrasse called the Restaurant Berlinerchen- this was great and we had some great local cuisine.Travelling from the hotel could not have been easier, we used the bus 100 to get to the Kudamm, Reichstag, Under den linden, Alex - and also the U and S bahns and of course the Trams in the east of the city.The 3 things we enjoyed most (apart from shopping - the wife )was the Reichstag, the Berlin wall memorial at Bernaur strasse (close to Nordbanhof), and seeing the bust of Nefertiti at the Altes musuemTo sum up we enjoyed a friendly, clean, well located hotel and we shall be staying there again when I run the Berlin marathon, oh yes check out the piece of the Berlin wall opposite the hotel at the Italian restaurant.RegardsBout ye aka the seeker of truth... and justice

<Content>Enjoyed my stay At the end of my travels in Europe, I decided to book a Junior Suite at this hotel for 3 nights. I got a reasonably good rate by booking directly with Sylter-Hof. The room was enormous compared to my previous accommodation. This was to be expected since I was paying extra for a suite. It was very clean and well appointed. I had difficulty with the key entry on the second day and reported it to the front desk and it was fixed in good time. The reception staff spoke English and were very helpful.As mentioned often in the reviews here, the tourist 100 bus stops outside the hotel and is very convenient for visiting the sights of Berlin. A definite plus. The front desk sells bus tickets. The internet is available on a PC near the lobby via a credit card. There is a cafe next door and the meals are perfectly fine. There is a large variety of selections for breakfast. It is buffet style so you can eat all you want.It`s very close to Kurfurstendamm and all the shops. Especially, KaDeWe which was celebrating its 100th birthday when I visited. I spent ages wandering in the food hall.Its location is excellent. It is a well run establishment and I would certainly recommend it to others.

<Content>Old hotel, old rooms... It will be a short review (as I only spend one short night there before changing hotel). Basically, either they have two different types of rooms (old and new) or then I can't understand some of the other reviews.The hotel itself is old, the rooms are old and small (but kinda clean), the bed is small and it was hot in the room. I felt like being in an average London hotel.For 85EUR/night you can get better deals in Berlin.The only positive thing I can say is that the people at the reception were welcoming and helpful.

<Content>UNSAFE - Beware! Please read this review before considering this hotel! You will NEVER want to stay there afterwards. My husband and I arrived at this hotel on Saturday afternoon, and went out for a tour of the city (the hotel demands that we give the key to the reception when we leave the premises). When we arrived back at the hotel around 9PM, my husband's bag (and ALL it's contents) were gone, stolen from our LOCKED room. There were no signs of forced entry. When we called the reception, their reply was Oh, this has happened before. Our locks really aren't safe, anyone can open them with a knife. We can't do anything for you. (They made it seem like this was completely normal, and found it strange when we asked them to call the police. The manager never asked to meet with us, but agreed to see us 4 days later, at our demand). When we called Expedia, saying that we really didn't feel safe in this hotel, they couldn't do anything for us, and said that all the hotels they recommend are fine (which is obviously NOT true!). The hotel eventually allowed us to switch rooms, but the second room had exactly the same lock as the previous one. I did not sleep for 2 days, and really didn't enjoy my vacation, fearing that my luggage would disappear as soon as I left the room. In conclusion, this was an awful experience, and I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. The way the situation was handled by the hotel staff and by Expedia was really disappointing.

<Content>Dissapointed I chose this hotel after reading reviews, but found the reality of the hotel somewhat lacking. The room was very basic and small and had not been cleaned very well there were still crumbs on the table. The worst bit was no airconditioning, the room was hot and stuffy despite having the windows open. There was only a heavy duvet on the bed which made sleeping uncomfortable and the pillows were feather so no matter how many you had you got no support. There was nothing in the Pay TV to cater for english speakers and no warning that it was all in german before committing to the cost. Glasses that I used during my stay were never washed and the room was never cleaned well.They advertise a hotel restaurant but it is never open, which means that you have to go elsewhere to eat. There was a rough crowd hanging around the hotel at night making a lot of noise into the small hours.The front desk were not much help when enquiring about tours and excursions so had to find those myself in the city.Overall I feel it was not worth the money I spent, in no way would I recommend it to others.

<Content>Brilliant place The location and standard is quite brilliant, especially if you don't want to spent too money on hotels. Only a short walk from Bahnhof Zoo. There is a bus stopp right outside the hotel. The bus takes you directly to Alexanderplatz. Really friendly staff, and they speak English.The single rooms are just beside a street with rather a lot of traffic. So if you are a light sleeper, like me, be sure to book room as high up as possible. The doubles are probably much more quiet.

<Content>friendly, comfortable, kind This a 3*+ with some great service above and beyond the call. A very handy location for public transport, shopping and a few good value neighbourhood restaurants and bars - and pretty nicely furnished. I had friends staying at the same time so even though we were upgraded for our seven nights (no extra charge) to a junior suite I still saw the double style room we might have had and thought it seemed well planned and comfortable. Being in the suite end was quieter. The newer tower by the restaurant filled up with coachloads of guests - sometimes noisy school trips. Hubby fell ill on our 2nd day and the reception staff found us medical help, gave lots of good advice and kept an eye on him for the rest of the trip. Housekeeping were diligent and high standard, the mini bar was well stocked and reflected local shop prices. Tried the restaurant first morning/afternoon for buffet lunch - very dull and not great value - never tried breakfast or the hotel coffee shop. Great bakery/coffee bar round the corner on Keithstrasse. We paid 拢50/night for a double and got excellent accomodation and service. 90% of the staff we met embarrassed me with their excellent English thank goodness - my German's still not too good!

<Content>Great Hotel  Stayed at the Sylter Hof for New Year. My friends had a double room and I had a single. My room overlooked the main road and wasnt noisy at all. Only thing was, the window let in a draught so I had to keep wrapped up at night but that wasn't too bothersome. The location of the hotel was great and it is very well connected. There are a number of stations nearby but we preferred the 15 min walk up to the Zoo Garden as that station takes you pretty much anywhere. If you dont fancy the walk up there, you can get the bus from across the road straight up the station. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel, or you can head down to Nollendorfplatz where there are some lovely restaurants. There is a really good Creole one (can't remember what it's called) which is a must-go!!!All in all, had a very pleasant stay at the Sylter Hof and wouldn't hesitate staying there again.

<Content>Fantastic value for money We had booked 6 months in advance - a wise move. The rooms were actually suites, and we only paid the regular room rate. The view from the 14th floor was spectacular. The overall standard of the rooms was impeccable, clean and nice. We didn't try the breakfast buffet, but tourists who are not short on time should rather go to one of Berlin's many and good breakfast-serving cafes. The location was also convenient, very close to Kurfurstendam. I would recommend this hotel to both business as well as leisure travellers.

<Content>Nice little hotel in a good location I spent 15 days in Berlin over Easter 2007. I chose the hotel having read the reviews on TripAdvisor and on the basis of a recommendation by a family member. I was not disappointed.Staff was helpful and acommodating. The location was perfect (for me). The buffet breakfast was good and items consistently replenished. On the basis of comments by previous reviewers I booked a double room for single use which gave me a bit more space than the single room and paid 69 Euro's per night including breakfast, which considering that it was over a holiday period was not bad, especially since a lot of the other hotels in my price range were booked up. Also based on comments from previous reviewers I asked for a quiet non-smoking room and was given a room at the back which was blissfully quiet (aside from the morning chorus from the birds). The only problem I had was at the end of the stay when some noisy travellers had booked several rooms on my floor, however after a call to reception all was quiet.I was a single mature woman travelling alone. I would thorougly recommend this hotel to others and would definitely stay there again should I return to Berlin. Thank you TripAdvisor reviewers for your helpful comments.

<Content>Great value We left it quite late booking a hotel for new year and stumbled across this one. We chose it mainly because it was not too expensive and in a good location. Considering this we were very pleased with the hotel when we arrived. We booked with booking.com and got a rate including breakfast for a junior suite. It was only 10 euros more a night for a suite so it seemed worth it. The suite was massive with a fantastic lounge with leather sofas and a view over the western side of Berlin. It was on the 15th floor (of 16) which is higher than most buildings in Berlin. The room was a bit warm but we found the thermostat for the radiators and managed to sort it out.We found the pillows a bit thin - we asked at reception and they brought us some more within half an hour.The whole suite was very clean and in good condition.As previous reviewers have mentioned, the 100 bus goes from outside which passes a lot of the main sights. It's about a 5 minute walk to Wittenbergplatz which has an underground and some good restaurants. The Zoo station is about 10 minutes walk away, this has trains to Potsdam for the castles there and in the other direction to other areas of the city.All in all we had a great holiday and I wouldn't change a thing about where we stayed.

<Content>We liked it We stayed for 4 nights starting new year's eve. All staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was basic and clean. The location is good, walking distance to zoo and Kurf眉rstendamm, buss no 100 stops right outside the entrance and take you to Alexanderplatz via many of the big sights in the centre. The hotel (not all rooms though) faces a busy road, it didn't disturb us, but beware if you're a light sleeper. Don't pay for the boring 鈧?3 breakfast, there's a coffee-shop next to the lobby.All in all, our experience is a friendly, good located hotel with great value (we paid ~鈧?0 per night for a double).

<Content>Great Location Six of us stayed at this hotel for three nights, our reason for visiting Berlin was to see the Christmas Markets. The hotel is on a busy main road, however once in the hotel you could not hear the traffic. The hotel is in a great location about a ten minute walk to the main shopping area, the hotel is very clean and comfortable and the rooms are cosy - if a little too warm!The reception and bar area is really nice, with nice big comfy sofas - it does however get a bit busy with people meeting there before their evening meal, but not too much of a problem. The number 100 bus stops right outside the hotel and for 鈧?.10 you can travel the whole of the city. Berlin is beautiful and very big so the bus is great to get around, the hotel is also only a 10 minute walk to the zoo. I would recommend this hotel to everyone, the staff are really helpful and friendly and nothing too much trouble. We did not have the breakfast which is 鈧?3 but you can go next door and get a great breakfast for 鈧?. If you stay in Berlin try this hotel I am sure you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Very good hotel - centrally located My wife, two teenage children and I stayed in the Sylter Hof for one week in mid July 2006. This is a very good hotel with an excellent, multilingual front desk and top class cleaning staff. The dining room is superb with the variety and quality of breakfast food on a par with good American hotels.As the weather was exceptionally hot during our stay, we paid Euro 20 per night extra for air conditioning. However, the single air conditioning unit was located in the master bedroom which meant we had to keep all doors open in an unsatisfactory attempt to cool all rooms in our sixteenth floor apartment. Notwithstanding, it would have been virtually impossible to sleep/relax in the hotel rooms without some air conditioning. In general, Berlin is very poorly equipped vis-a-vis air conditioning. Quite large supermarkets and restaurants are bereft of any cooling system. Hotel Sylter Hof is very centrally located, close to the Kudam area and the Ka De We shopping mall (Berlin's Harrods).In conclusion, we wish to acknowledge the Trip Advisor Reviews as being very accurate and we would recommend the Hotel Sylter Hof as an excellent location and good value for money.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This is an excellent hotel. We arrived at almost midnight, but the staff were very helpful. The room was a suite and had two beds in the main room and two more in the ante room. There was plenty of shelf space in the bathroom. Breakfast was 鈧?3 but we ate 200 metres down the road for 鈧?. There was so much space in the room, it reminded me of a Shangri-La hotel.  We were in Berlin when the plot to blow up planes from London was discovered. The staff looked up everything for us on the web and couldn't have been more helpful. We loved the small packs of Gummi Bears by the bed each night, a nice change from chocolates. Any quibbles? Only two. No face cloths in the bathroom and no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Apart from that it was great, plenty of room and the 100 bus right outside the door. and all we paid was 鈧?9 a night. Next time I'm in Berlin I'm coming here, it's so much nicer than the Swissotel, that we stayed in last time. Don't believe the star rating it's much better than a 3 star hotel.

<Content>Great Staff and great hotel We stayed here 8th May,2006 for 3 nights. Upon arrival we were greeted like we were the only people to ever stay here. Her name was Inga and she was excellent told us all about Berlin and the Hotel and what was near by. The hotel is in a great location close to a big shopping centre and a lot of cafes. The hotel itself was the best value hotel in our whole 42 days in Europe. It was very clean excellent bathrooms, large widows that you can open to let fresh air in and also dry underwear and socks, the beds were very comfortable and there were also lifts. As we said this was the cheapist hotel we paid for and was one of the best. When we go back we would stay there again, big thanks to the staff in particular Inga.Deryl  Fiona DowlingTasmaniaAustralia

<Content>Super value Stayed at the Sylter Hof for four days during the World Cup as one of a party of seven. Our group booked one double and two triples. The double was fairly pokey but the 10th floor triples were extremely spacious. The triples were described as suites and indeed had a large seating area and a separate kitchen which had a sink, cupboards, fridge  table. However, for some strange reason, the kitchen was devoid of pots, pans  crockery! It was very hot during our stay and the lack of air con was a problem at night, although a large fan was provided.The hotel has a very pleasant lobby, is centrally located, very quiet and extremely good value over the internet at 180 euro per night for a triple room, excluding breakfast. I would definitely pay a bit extra for a triple. Plenty of places nearby to get breakfast for about 7 euro. Overall the staff were friendly, courteous and very efficient. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good central base in Berlin and a bit of comfort on a modest budget.

<Content>Great Accomodation, Great Location I highly recommend the Hotel Sylter Hof. It offers good accommodation for an affordable price. The location is great, within walking distance from the Zoo Bahnhof (about 10 minutes walking) and only 3 blocks from major subway lines. Not to mention the 100 bus that stops right in front of the hotel. I stayed at one of their suites in 2006. The bedroom, bathroom and kitchen were sparkling clean. The bedroom had three large windows that opened plus a forth one in the kitchen. The kitchen was spacious, much larger than most kitchens in New York City, and it had a stove with an oven and a small refrigerator but no utensils, pans or plates. The staff was very friendly and everyone spoke at least three languages, including English. The hotel also has a Coffee Shop, which serves simple and cheap food. The things I didn鈥檛 like about the hotel:1.Apparently there is no such thing as a non-smoking room. Although I had requested a non-smoking room and was given one in a non-smoking floor with non-smoking signs all over, the smell was overwhelming. From the pillows to the curtains, everything smelled cigarette smoke. It took two days with all the windows open during the day for the smell to go away. By then, all my clothing, even the ones inside the bags, smelled bad.2.The rooms have no air-conditioning. I stayed there during the winter months, so I didn鈥檛 need air-conditioning but I wouldn鈥檛 stay there during the summer. The windows are sound proof and the traffic noise from the two large avenues that surround the building were of no concern. However, the noise was quite loud with the windows open.

<Content>Rex Reuter, I can't thank you enough From check in to check out, I would have to say that I have never experienced a more seamless, professional hotel stay. Upon check-in, we were greeted with the utmost respect, having everything waiting for us - room key (which I should mention was emblazoned with the finest gold), fresh towels, and a personal letter written by Rex himself. Our room was exactly what we ordered, with arguably the best kitchen facilities I have seen this side of the eastern block. The staff provided us a cot at no extra charge and without a hassle. And the bar - words can't express how great it was. The very attractive waitress made it her duty to make sure my friend and I had the best experience possible. The endless choices of drinks and the fabulous clientele (especially the Finns that we met) added to our experience. Rex - you should be proud of your role in making us some of the happiest hotel guests in the world. The service you and your staff provide was worthy of other's emulation. Rex is the best!

<Content>Great Location I stayed at this hotel during the Berlinale Film Festival. I had a single room, which some might find small but suited my needs perfectly. The room was very clean and well kept. What I loved most about this hotel was the location. The 100 bus, which takes you past the Reichstag and onto unter den Linden, stops right outside the hotel. Kurfurstendamm (major shopping street) and Bahnhof Zoolischer Garten is about a 15 minute walk. The department store KaDeWe was right around the corner. It was especially handy for the film festival as there were two theatres within walking distance. The breakfast buffet was a little steep at 13 euros a pop, but it was plentiful and I liked it. There is also a resonably priced cafe adjacent to the hotel, a grocery store across the street for self caterers. The staff are very helpful. I love this city, and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good hotel My wife and I stayed at Hotel Sylter Hof in Berlin from 4 until 8 october 2005. Rooms and service are good. However, as the hotel is situated on the busy and noisy Kurf眉rsterstrasse, it is preferable to book a room with windows on the backside.As breakfast in the hotel is rather expensive, we had our daily breakfast in a very good coffee shop next door to the hotel.
