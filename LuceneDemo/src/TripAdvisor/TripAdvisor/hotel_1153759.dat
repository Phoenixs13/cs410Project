<Content>No value for your money This hotel is a Golf Resort /Country Club.  I booked the Deluxe Room Golf View which is more expensive than the Superior (Bungalow) Rooms, but actually what I got was a Garden View Room. The reception staff is not friendly, I arrived at 1PM but I still have to wait for one and a half hour for our rooms to be cleaned. No swimming pool, No gym, No Jogging track. In my opinion, This hotel's room need to be renovated. It was opened in 1974.  It is already not decent to be named a country club.The Bathroom tiles was mouldy and closet's water keep running. When it is bath time, I found out it has no hot water until I complain and they send a technician to fix the water heater. The in-house telephone does not worked that I have to walked to the Front Office to complain about the hot water.The breakfast in buffet was much under the standard of any four star hotel's menu, you only have three choice of menu: fried rice, fried noodle or cooked omlette. And for drinks, besides tea or coffee; you only have Orange Juice, Tomato juice or plain water.I regret I don't get any value for the money I had paid for this hotel room.
