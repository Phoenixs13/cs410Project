<Content>Reminiscence of 19th century Germany It's rather close to Alexanderplatz, and very close to two subway stations as well as other major sites. The hotel itself is in a quiet street. Although my room faced the street, on the ground floor, I didn't have any noise problem at all. However, the sheets were more than just gently used. So all night long, I felt rather uncomfortable. The internet was also VERY slow, and in room DSL was an extra cost so don't plan to browse the web there, if you are not willing to spend 10Euro for in-room connection. Breakfast was around 15 Euro...you are better off getting food outside.However, the place was clean, and the decor rather typical old-German style.

<Content>Luisenhof a good Berlin Mitte location We stayed at the Luisenhof for a week and found it more than acceptable. The location is convenient to Museum Island and is located equally from two metro stations that linked to everything. We walked to the Reichstag and the Nikolaivertiel. Our room was quiet, well furnished, clean and in good repair. The reception area was fine, staff very amiable and helpful, and the continental breakfast was superb (well worth the surcharge!). Just a few steps away is a post office, and there were several small cafes and pubs within a minute's walk. These are all the positives.On the negative side, we found the street to be pretty noisy. Since it was unseasonably warm when we were there, we were compelled to leave our windows open all night. The street racket was considerable and I was glad I had earplugs. But that was the only negative about our stay. If you knew this in advance and could ask for a room on the back side, you probably would love this hotel.Oh, they had a mini-bar in the room. We did not use it except to keep our store-bought water cold. Prices were the usual outrageous mini-bar markup.

<Content>Luisenhof, Berlin - Great Hotel! On something of a whim, I decided to go to Berlin for a week. When I started looking for a hotel, I had trouble finding one for the whole week that seemed OK . Using the Berlin Tourist agency website, this hotel came up as available and I booked it. What a great find! It's exactly the kind of hotel I love. Small -about 50 rooms, individually owned and with character. I had a single room, and it was small but immaculately clean and comfortable. While the building itself is old, it's obviously been renovated recently. The room was so quiet! Even though it was cool outside, the room was comfortable all the time. I loved the location - very close to all the major attractions but in a residential neighborhood. The best part was it's proximity to three major mass transit stations. The nearest subway was about 100 meters from the front door. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only negative is that there are not too many restaurants close to the hotel. I enjoyed the two nearby though, but I think you might have to speak German.

<Content>a lovely hotel this is a lovely small hotel with very pretty rooms and a pleasant, helpful staff; we had two rooms, both a nice size, bathrooms very clean (the shower stalls were sort of small, but otherwise fine). Restaurant for breakfast is small and charming. There is a decent internet cafe a short walk up the street with very inexpensive rates (as we discovered when we had to rebook our flight home due to the Heathrow airport closing). It's close to an U-bahn stop which was a relief after a long day of walking! We'd stay here again, it's a nice place.

<Content>Great Berlin Hotel Stayed in this hotel for a week in March 2005. Rooms are well appointed, and stqaff is courtious and at least bilingual(german and English). The hotel resteraunt is excellent. Continental breakfast featured the normal rolls, cheeses, breads,and meats,but they also had special delicacies such as scrambled eggs, pickled herring and hardboiled eggs with caviar.However, location is probably the hotels number 1 feature. It is about 150 yards from an u-bahn stop, and it is in easy walking distance of Museum Island and the Nicholivertl

<Content>Good location in old East Berlin near the museums Hotel Luisenhof is a romantic, stylish traditional German hotel. The staff is courteous, with some speaking English fairly well. The rooms are decorated in a romantic fashion with modern marble bathrooms, though this particular room had a small shower. The Wintergarden room for the buffet is strikingly delightful and the breakfast buffet was very good. The location was 200 meters from the U-bahn and safe to walk any time of night, unlike other areas in old east Berlin like the Alexander Platz. The neighborhood is within a kilometer of the museums, a nice walk made even more interesting as many buildings are under restoration. We would stay at the Hotel Luisenhof again.
