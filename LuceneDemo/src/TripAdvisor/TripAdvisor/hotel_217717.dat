<Content>Horrible is a compliment The up side- A refrigerator, microwave ,stove,dirty plates and dirty silverware,coffee maker with 1 coffee packet per stay,and TV with basic cable.The downside, tiny room, dirty, burn holes in blanket and tears too, self service towels, no housekeeping unless you stay 5 days and that gets you one cleaning. But worst of all I stayed when temperature was 27 degrees and the heat didn't work.... and noboby cared. Was told you can write the owners if you want. I checked out a day earlier with no refund and upgraded by staying at a Motel 6 which was cheaper and cleaner. Would not reccomend this dump to anybody.
