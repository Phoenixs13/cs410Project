<Content>Fantastic Experience! My family (three teenage daughters and my wife and I) stayed in the Hotel Brandies for 4 nights. It was a perfect delight. The front desk staff is cordial and accomodating; the breakfast is a nice feature and has an ample variety; the rooms are clean, with tall ceilings, comfortable beds. The rooms in the rear of the Hotel overlook a lovely courtyard. Hotel Brandiess is an uncomplicated, celan, safe, and pleasant exeperience.Outside the front door, it is fewer than 20 steps to the Kaiserdam station on the U2 subway line; the S train is a little more than a block away.One block north of the Hotel is a grocery store along with several very friendly restaurants.When next in Berlin with the family, we will certainly return to Hotel Brandies!!

<Content>charming old world convinient for transport and reasona This hotel is a converted apartment budilding from 1910, one of a few pre WW2 buildings still intact in the area. There are still some apartments in the building so teh feel is very residential. The lift is from 1913 a real relic but still functioning and adds to teh overall charm of the place. The U-bahn is 200m from the hotels entrance and taxis from the centre of Berlin are apporx 12 euros at night. Breakfast was a good german style buffet and service was great. The rooms were very spacious with herringbone parquet and modern decor.All in all an excellent choice, convinient for transportation and very reasonably priced at approx 60 euros per night.

<Content>Charming hotel We had a great weekend in Berlin - and Hotel Brandies definitely was a good choice for that.Although we had booked the hotel via the internet without knowing anyhting about it, it turned out to be a very good choice. Not only was the price (approx. 60 euros/night incl. a great breakfast) hard to beat, but what you get is way above average:- huge rooms (apart from a 5* suite i've never stayed in a room larger than the one we got)- comfortable beds (although not very wide, maybe 1m)- romantic setting (converted elegant house, even fake chimney with lights etc.)- great location - the subway is just across the street, the cab to the airport Tegel gets you there in about 10mins (cost me 13 euros in April 2007)- quiet (they apologized upon arrival that all quiet courtyard rooms were taken, but even for my light sleep the streetside room was quiet enought to get a night's rest)Negative:- they couldn't find my reservation on arrival (took us 15 mins to get everything sorted out)- took 10 mins to check outI can definitely recommend Hotel Brandies. Next time I go to Berlin I'll stay there again.

<Content>A Decent Little Hotel - "Old Berlin" Atmosphere We were just passing through Berlin and needed a place to stay in town for the night. We booked ahead on the internet and hadn't a clue what the place was like. It was a NICE place to stop for the night. It was not that close to the Tegel airport (28 euro cab fare), inside the city, less than half a block from the closest underground station. They held the room for our late arrival. The woman at the desk was very helpful and spoke excellent English. The hotel is a converted house/apartment building. Small and intimate. We stayed in room 22 which had a nice courtyard (quiet) view. The beds were comfortable and spacious. The bathrooms were clean. You HAVE to go here just to ride the elevator. It is a time machine, something from an older, more elegant era. The floors were wonderfully creaky but the furnishings were modern.Room rate was 85 Euros with breakfast. We enjoyed our stay there.
