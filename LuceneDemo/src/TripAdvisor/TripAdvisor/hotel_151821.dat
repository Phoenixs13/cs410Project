<Content>Disappointed It was our first night's stay during a 8-night trip in PR, and we were disappointed. We chose the least expensive room and it was crappy - kind of like Super-8 in US but worse. The food was terrible - we only had breakfast there and could not even get freshly made juice (aren't we in Carribean?). The staff did not provide quality service (though one can figure that they are not treated very well).The view indeed is very nice - the hotel is built on the cliff, but there is a highway between the cliff and the beach, so there is a constant humming of the cars. Plus - you can't really walk to the beach. The closest beach is the kind surfers would enjoy (a swimmer's suicide). It's just down the hill (a short drive, though you do need to cross the highway to get there). The closest beach, however, is a 20-25 minute drive. Totally worth going there! I would recommend though finding a place to stay where the beach is. Vistamar is not worth what you pay for it (even when it is the cheapest room rate).

<Content>Poorodor VIstamar We chose this place for the location and that's about what it was good for. This is a 1960's vintage hotel that has been marginally kept up. They had a nice pool, but as we were there on the weekend, it was crowded with locals drinking and partying to all hours. The signs say that the pool is supposed to close at 10PM, but the very loud music and drinking, etc. continued all night and morning long and the desk would do nothing to stop it (obviously they get the majority of their business from this activity, so the needs of the tourists are not as important). The rooms were run down - the phone did not work, there were bugs, the bathroom floor was always wet because the shower had cracks that allowed it to leak. I'd look for another place if I went back to that area.

<Content>OK for a night As a family of four, we spent our first night in Puerto Rico at the Vistamar. The property is located on the side of a mountain with a view of the ocean. Unfortunately, the highway runs between the ocean and the parador and trucks could be heard accelerating or using their airbrakes depending upon their direction on the highway. The coquis chirped merrily all night. We were awakened by roosters in the morning (seems like everyone in the countryside has a rooster).The property was basically pretty clean but a bit dated.
