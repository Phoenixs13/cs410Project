<Content>A little scary I stayed here with my husband last year, when we were in town for a mariner game. I must tell you that the cabbie driver that took us back from the game actually told us that he normally does not pick up people from this hotel, and told us to be careful.....I would never ever recommend it!

<Content>Not impressed Not impressed with this Hotel, the bed was very uncomfortable and both myself and my 21 year old daughter woke up with backache after each of the 3 nights we stayed here. It wasn't very clean, the maid was miserable and kept leaving the bathroom window open, which was a security risk. The Hotel Laundry was not operational, so we were unable to do any laundry before our cruise (which also had no laundry). Having had to wash articles by hand and dry as best we could, we found after leaving the hotel we had left several things behind and have contacted Travelodge in the hope of getting the items returned, so far we have not had any luck.However, the front desk staff were friendly and helpful and it was very close to the cruise terminal.

<Content>Stay away!! We planned a trip to Seattle for a Mariner's game and when all downtown hotels were booked we settled for this one because it was a short 5-10 minute bus ride to the stadium. Boy, do we wish we would have done some research.Don't be fooled by the photo, this hotel is dirty and disgusting. Pulling up we knew we were in trouble and the rather large sign saying No Refunds was a dead give-away we were in trouble. Being as we had already paid online we were forced to stay.Bad:- Parking lot is tiny and very hard to find a spot. You can park on the street, but...- Bad neighborhood. We never felt safe and made sure to come home before it got dark. Some friends who live in the area wouldn't even come to visit.- Very dirty and disgusting rooms. It looked like no one had cleaned since the hotel opened. The walls were grimey and dirty, we were afraid to take our shoes off on the carpet, the bathroom walls were turning yellow and had spider webs and even a smashed spider on the wall, our frozen pizza went to waste because we were afraid to use the extremely dirty oven (which had a smelly pan full of who-knows-what inside of it), the fridge smelled bad and barely stayed cold, cigarette burns on most furniture of our non-smoking room.- Bathroom sinks did not work right and the water tasted funny. Also, the bathroom door was sagging and had to nearly be slammed to close.- Beds were very hard and felt like sleeping on the floor. No padding at all.- Front door didn't close all the way. Thank goodness for the latch but felt very uneasy about leaving our stuff in the room when we were not there.- Free breakfast consisted of small muffins, juice/coffee, and rotten bananas and apples.- We stayed two nights and never saw a member of housekeeping and no one ever cleaned our room. We had to go to the front desk and ask for more towels for the second day.- No internet serviceGood:- Staff was extremely pleasant to deal with. We talked to them multiple times asking for more towels, directions, etc. and they were always very helpful and courteous.- Bus stop directly across the street from the hotel takes you right downtown and past the stadium.- Room was big- TV had free HBO and a remote control- Free 1-800 and local phone calls.

<Content>the worst place to stay Wished I would have researched further by reviews but was not expecting how bad this place was, it looked like something out of the 60's,filthy walls,ceiling, old furniture, rugs with burns in them, stinky curtains, bathroom needed repairs everywhere, no screens on the windows,wallpaper from the 70's and had probably not been cleaned since then, sheets wouldn't stay on the springy mattress, the only thing good about it was the location and staff. If not for the reservations, and if I would have seen the room first I would have not stayed. In the future before we make reservcations, we will be more carefull to research the place we hope to sleep comfortably in. Hope someday they will do some remodeling.

<Content>Disgusting Checked out after viewing room. This place was unacceptable. The room smelled of pungent disinfectant. The walls, bedspread, carpet and upholstery had stains. Wallpaper was falling off. Cigarette burns on all the furniture. Huge chips in porcelain on bathroom sink. Missing baseboard molding. Chair frames with chunks of wood missing. All upholstery had tears in it. Just horrible!
