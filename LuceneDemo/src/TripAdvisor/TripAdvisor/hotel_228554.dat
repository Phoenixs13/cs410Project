<Content>Good Location for shops Very good location for the shopping centre. 7 minute walk to metro. The rooms were clean and friendly staff but we were on the 4th floor and it was still noisy outside. The avda diagonal is a very busy road and the night club nearby did not help either when they decide to leave in the early hours. But the main problem was they charge 32鈧?a night for parking which is crazy so we did not use them for parking our car which was very inconvenient.

<Content>Unfriendly! Rooms are big, location not good. But the staff....! Unfriendly is hardly the correct term for them. We were made to feel particularly unwelcome. Certainly wouldn't consider it again.

<Content>Nice hotel Nice hotel. Huge rooms and hallways. Nice that they have a parking directly below the hotel, but it is quite expensive. Small disadvantages that rooms have no balcony and smell like cigarettes (and I am a smoker).

<Content>Nice stay We stayed at the Hua L'illa for a three day Barcelona trip and it was quite good and available at a very reasonable price. Spacious rooms, albeit a bit old. Nice and clean bathroom.

<Content>Average hotel The hotel rooms are hugh and clean but you can see that the hotel is quite old by the softness of the matresses, television and the bath room. The male staff could be a little more friendly.

<Content>Good hotel Admittedly not very close to the tourist centre of Barcelona, but if like us your business was more local to this area then this is a great hotel- escpecially if you can get a room at a discounted price.

<Content>Untitled review The bedroom and bathroom are huge! And they're kept clean. Although the hotel is a good bit away from the city centre, La Ramble etc., it has good transport links - it's on a night bus route. A good place to base yourself if you're staying for a few days, but not if it's a weekend and you want to stagger back to your room after a night on the beer in the city centre! It's close to the Nou Camp stadium, if footie tickles your fancy.

<Content>Dingy and Tired Two words: photos lie. I just returned from staying at the Husa L'illa Hotel in Barcelona and came away disappointed. DO NOT BELIEVE EXPEDIA RATINGS. This is NOT a four-star hotel. This is the second time I have booked a room via Expedia and have been disappointed. A three-star for this hotel is pushing it. I am sure in its day, the hotel was considered a luxuary hotel, but this hotel has seen better days. The hotel is tired and dingy and so is the staff (except for one young gentelman with a pony tail who was very eager to answer questions), the other older gentleman did not seem like they wanted to be there. They did not go above the simple yes and no questions. When I asked if the hotel had a fitness center, I was told no but there was one a few blocks away. When I got to the fiteness center, I was told I needed to come with a member or have the hotel give me a pass. This was never offered to me when inquiring about the gym. Needless to say, I had to go back and ask for a pass, which cost $15.00 and return to the gym. Not a big deal, but that's the difference between a good hotel and a not-so-good-hotel--the details.Also, since guest can SMOKE anywhere they please, the hallways and room have an antiseptic smell to cover up the odor of an ashtray. The windows in the hotel do not open so there is no possibity for fresh air. As for breakfast (not included), you are better off going to Starbucks across the street. Not worth the money. I will say, the location is great and you are very close to the Metro, which is very easy to use. The last time I was in Barcelona, I stay in the Ramla area. Too much a circus for me. This is a much better location and only four or five stops on the Metro. The Mall next store offers a lot of diversion and a few eating establishments. Make sure you go to the lower level where there are many eateries. The Hilton Barelona is only one block away and it looks very nice. I had a drink at the bar. Husa L'ills doesn't have a bar and only one computer which you pay to use by the minutes. I would guess that the Hilton is more money, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. A lesson learned.

<Content>Good rate and good sized rooms Except for one staff member's unhelpful attitute I'd give this an excellent rating. Hotel and parking is easy to find. Parking is part of huge car park under shopping complex. Make sure you get 17 euro/day hotel rates rather than regular rates of 36euro/day. I had trouble getting this one unhelpful staff member to even tell me about the hotel car parking, never mind get the Hotel rate as places were limited. He was even less helpful when I asked for a local restaurant which was stange when we figured out how many there were. Don't want to dwell on this individual's performance but such a shame as the hotel would be excellent. Aircon was a bit noisy in the room but no real problems with any other part of the hotel or any other staff members. Not really central but tram is outside front door and tourist bus stop is 10 minutes walk which gets you around all of Barcelona. Well worth it if you are on a short visit or want to do a quick one day review over everything. The Hotel is part of a big shopping block so loads of shops and food available within 2 minutes walk. I paid 64euro per room/night. Good rate and big rooms where extra bed is no problem.

<Content>I have never been in a better one. Every thing was perfect. Huge rooms. Excellent airconditioning and house keeping. Very attractive location, specially for women (A lovely shopping centre anjacent). Very clean. And we paid just around 65 pounds per night for a twin bedroom in a summer special offer. I booked it through expedia.

<Content>Great Hotel! First Class Hotel, as a regular visitor to various European Hotels this rates right up there, the rooms were spacious and very clean, the staff were very friendly. Although primarily a business hotel, I stayed with my young child and couldn't have asked for better/friendlier service. The shower broke on one occasion and it was repaired within 15 minutes! Very pleasant location, plenty to do in the area, shopping etc. even a small fairground at the rear. Would definetly stay there again!!

<Content>Great location for shopping The hotel is very clean, rooms are spacious and ours on the fifth floor had great views over the city. Service is excellent. Breakfast varied and plentiful. Lovely upmarket shopping centre under the hotel. About an hour to walk to the Ramblas, so we took taxis or the tube. I would definitely use this hotel again when staying in Barcelona.
