<Content>Great location in a busy neighborhood The Kastanienhof is on the busiest street of the Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood, so public transport is easily accessible (a tram runs in front) but it's also quite noisy.Our room was on the 4th floor, right under the roof, so we had no windows to the street, only roof windows. The lift only went to the 3rd floor, so we had to walk up a flight.The breakfast was good and abundant. The staff was largely helpful, if a bit brusque.

<Content>Cool Place with Great Location Loved the breakfast. Double room very spacious. Little dicey finding the place at first. We eventually learned to take the S-Bahn to Hackischer Markt, and then take the street car going north. It drops you right in front of the place, thereby making it a great location at a good price. We will visit the place again if we are in Berlin. Also loved the numerous maps they had as wall decoration.

<Content>Great little place with friendly staff My husband and I stayed here 5 nights--1 night @ 95 euros and the rest @ 74 from Oct 1-5. We found the staff to be extremely pleasant and helpful letting us borrow travel books from the library for the day, helping us figure out walking distances Potsdam and walking us thru the complicated Berlin transit system.The place was clean, fairly quiet (our room was on the street side) and well-appointed with tv, writing desk and fridge. The breakfast had a wide array of breads, cheeses, meats, fruits, juices, mueslis. Go early to get best choices--the really good stuff tends to run out. The tram runs right in front so very convenient to get to.Only complaint, the 4th floor rooms are in the attic and have only skylights for windows but they open for fresh air. I would stay here again and recommend it highly.

<Content>Nice, homely and friendly staff I have stayed at the Kastanienhof on three occassions and all three have been very positive experiences. The staff members are all extremely nice and always willing to help - ask for a room facing the street, and you will get a nice view of Kastanienall茅e without too much noise. The breakfast is excellent. I have been arriving very early on all three visits, and it has been a great pleasure that I could access my room immediately upon my arrival.Only drawbacks are that it's somewhat expensive compared to hotels of similar standards, and the decorating - especially in the lobby - is quite tacky and touristey.

<Content>Great Rooms, but expensive. We stayed in the hotel during the first week of July in 2005. The tram stop is right next to the hotel. The breakfast was great. They had a wide spread from cereal to sliced meats and cheeses. I would recommend the hotel if you have a little extra money to spend. The rooms were nice and they are very courtious people working. The bathroom was excellent compaired to the hotel that we stayed in Paris. Berlin is the cleanest city I been in Europe.

<Content>"great breakfast" and nice rooms We stayed here in 2002 so the rate of exchange was much better and the cost for a double room came to about 90.00 USD that would be more now, but the rooms were great and the breakfast was wonderful. Lots of nice fresh rolls, pastries juices cheese etc. Good location a tram stop right in front of hotel and a 3 block walk to get subway. The only drawback was there are no restaurants nearby so you have to plan were you will eat to avoid going back and forth to hotel. We asked for a room facing the back I would think there would be a lot of traffic noise if u were facing the street.
