<Content>nice place Nice location, this one is 2 blocks from a big mall, and if you do not care to take a bus ( pesero) it is 10 minutes from a subway station, that is one the most important thing in Mexico DF because the chaotic traffic. It is close to University and azteca stadium.

<Content>Great Value Ok first of all these is a business oriented hotel, location is great for those who visit southern corporate offices.Rates are fair and cheaper on weekends due to target market, however if you want to visit Mexico University, Tlalpan Centre, Xochimilco or Coyoacan these is the place to stay.Cab rides to downtown are extremely expensive so if you wish to visit Centro or piramides never mind booking these place.Rooms are great, extremely clean and with cool amenities just don鈥檛 mind the view its little depressive.Food is not great however there's a mall on a walking distance where you can eat or dine.Airport is extremely far so prepare to pay a 300 fee for the cab ride.I definitely recommend these place
