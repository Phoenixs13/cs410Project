<Content>Not reliable I made the reservation direct with the hotel that told me that a cancellation free of charge was possible till two days before my arrive. After I sent my credit card (10 days before I leave) to guaranty my reservation they informed me I couldn't cancel anymore and charged my credit card, so I had to pay the total ammount for 4 people before leaving Brasil!!! The hotel acomodations are ok, the breakfast is very good but people are not friendly and never give you your messages. I advise you NOT TO SEND THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER!!!!

<Content>Not the best place to be in berlin First We found cockroachs on the bed. We asked for another room and they complaied and we even had to show the cockroach to the person in charge. Afteralls we got another room, quite noisy by the way. We treatment was very rude and breakfast was not very well. Having known all we spent the first night we very kindly asked to stay another two nights but changing the room. The person in charge was ok with the idea so the next day we asked for the number of the other room and she denied the question. So we have to argued with her and finally she accepted to do that. The other room was so quite nevertheless the shower was broken.Apart two people from the hotel the treatment was not very ok and they don麓t resolve problems properly. I know quite well hotels in Berlin and the are usually clean, cheap and have nice people.

<Content>A mixed pleasure This hotel has some charm, with it's old fashioned furniture. Thank God our room was on the first floor as there is no elevator.Breakfast was good. There is a restaurant, which we decided to try one night, but it was buffet only. The kitchen was closed that night, so they had no a la carte. The food was nothing special at all,mostly cold dishes, not recommendable.The room and bathroom was modern and comfortable.The negative things was the noise from the street, and the desk staff. The girl at the desk the first day was lovely. But the night receptionist was very unfriendly and not helpful at all. He barely spoke or understood a word of english.The day we were leaving (very early in the morning), he didn't seem to know the prosedures for cheking out guests. He seemed very confused about everything. He asked for 66 euros although the room was prepaid. When I asked him for an explanation he didn't seem to understand. He just pointed at the reciept and said something in german that non of us understood. We had no choice but to pay the 66 euros even though we didn't know what we payed for and the reciept didn't say anything about what it was.And when we asked if he could call a taxi for us, he didn't say a word, he just made the phone call and said something in german that non of us understood a word of.This was a very unpleasant experience. Aside from that, the room and bathroom was exeptionally clean, and the beds were good.I don't think I will choose this hotel the next time I am going to Berlin (a wonderful city by the way).

<Content>A pleasant Surprise! My wife and I stayed at the Altberlin at the end of August 2006 for 3 nights.After recovering form the first shock of having to climb to the third floor (no lifts!), and coming to terms with the medieval motif of the reception, we discovered our hotel to be really above average in all respects, and certainly good value (note- try to book over the internet, as advertised prices at reception are much higher).Breakfast is excellent and dinner is very good value. Staff is helpful and rooms are comfortable. In terms of location, it is very central and within walking distance to underground stations, the Philarmonic Hall and Potsdam Square.If you dislike stairs, make sure you ask for a lower floor room. For guaranteed tranquility ask for a room facing the inner quad.The hotel owner makes a special effort to transport you to Berlin of 19th century. One very important aspect is that the hotel is small, which makes it cosy.

<Content>Some charm, lots of noise I stayed 2 weeks at the Hotel Altberlin, mostly during the Berlin Film Festival. It's a very convenient 10 minute walk to Potsdamer Platz, which is the hotel's chief virtue. It also has a somewhat stagey old-world charm, with lobby and restaurant decor from the early 20th century. The wait staff in the restaurant even wear Weimar-era costumes!One big problem: I woke up every morning to the sounds of doors slamming. A combination of large, heavy doors, weak hinges and thin walls mean that noise might be your strongest memory of this place.
