<Content>A slice of heaven a stone's throw from Barcelona Having just spent a glorious week at the Castell de L'oliver I feel compelled to promote it. It really was a slice of heaven. It is a castle that has been slowly and with utter perfection turned into a glorious hotel set only 35 km outside of Barcelona (it was a really easy half an hour drive direct to the centre). We had a sea view suite which was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. It has an amazing pool area which is hard to drag yourself away from and a restaurant where the service and especially the food served was better than I have had in some highly rated Michelin star restaurants. GO - it is glorious. It is run by a family and because it is their business, they just keep on top of everything and genuinely care. Finally, if I was not already married... it was be the most ideal location for a wedding, it even has a private chapel.
