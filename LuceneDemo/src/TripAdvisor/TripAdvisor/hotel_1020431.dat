<Content>Great hostel, centrally located I stayed here for three nights when I went to Barcelona for a long weekend. It is a great property that is fairly centrally located in the old town very close to the ferry terminal. The entire place was immaculate and provided towels/sheets/etc. It was in a very safe neighborhood and about 5-10 mins from the Drassanes metro stop and the Ramblas. It is only about a 15 min walk from Barceloneta beach, and about 10 mins from the cathedral. There is good shopping for boutique-type stores as well. The location is definitely its best quality!Additionally, the rooms were fairly spacious. However, at night the rooms got fairly hot, and the windows were small. Overall, the management was good and present 24hrs/day to let you in, it was clean, great location, and they had free cookies! Would definitely recommend and stay here again.
