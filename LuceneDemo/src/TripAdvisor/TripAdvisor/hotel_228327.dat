<Content>The worst hotel I have ever encountered Without doubt this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.I travelled with my wife who was a delegate at a conference. We paid extra for a larger room with more facilities. What these 'extra' facilities were we could not tell.The room was clean but very bare and only furnished with very basic cheap furnitureFirst thing I noticed - NO ROOM SAFE - nowhere to keep a laptop or other valuables. The reception staff said we could keep valuables in the reception safe - just imagine 1000 delegates all trying to keep their laptops in one safe. In addition the hotel specifically stated that no resposibility would be taken for any valuables not in the hotel safe.The beds were adequate but the pillows were paper-thin - I needed three which were equal to one normal pillow.The towels were so thin and worn - a bit like trying to dry yourself on tissue paper.There were no normal toiletries - shampoo/conditioner /bar of soap. etc. even water for taking tablets had to be paid for at expensive minibar pricesThe sink plug did not retain water because it did not fit.The shower head was broken and hanging loose.There is no facility in the room to make a cup of tea or coffee - and there is no room service.There are no spa or swimming facilities.Food and drink are extremely expensive (the bar prices doubled during the period of the conference)At checkout they tried to charge us for using PayTV and argued with us to the point of shouting - quite disgraceful behaviour. They claimed that everybody tries to pretend that PayTV was not used.  I know that it was not used at any time we were in the room - perhaps the management need to investigate their staff or their PayTV software. The location of the hotel is in a very undesirable area - you would not dream of going for a walkabout at night or even during the day. Security was nonexistent - anybody could enter the building and go anywhere to any floor in the hotel.The conference organisers had described this hotel as being an award winning hotel - somebody must be joking!  Anyone thinking of staying at this hotel I would recommend to reconsider - there are far better and cheaper hotels in the centre of Berlin. e.g. 'The Swissotol' in the centre which is excellent in every way I hope this review may help anyone to avoid the experiences we encountered.

<Content>Simply the Best! The Estrel is simply my favorite hotel. I come to Berlin every few months for a convention, and always chose to stay at this hotel. The prices are VERY fair compared to the other hotel prices in Berlin. The hotel features everything I need, restaurants, bars, and even live entertainment. The location next to the water and the train station provides easy access to the city center within 10 minutes. I would recommend this Hotel to all business travelers and families looking for a great vacation. Also, the Hotel is recently upgrading all of its rooms and suites. I slept in one of the new rooms, and I have to say they are great. The new style is more Asian-European, with bamboo wood, and art. VERY VERY NICE! Keep it up Estrel, you are simply the best!

<Content>We felt royally ripped off.Never Never again would we stay here We stayed at the Estrel because we were attending a trade show in Berlin and this hotel was recommended by the organisers of the show. As we wanted some extra nights in Berlin, We arrived 2 days before the trade show started. This was a real eye opener. In the days before the main trade show guests arrived, a beer was priced reasonably at 3 Euro. However on the Wednesday night all the bar prices leaped up by more than 100% pricing a beer now at 6 Euro and a GT at a staggering 10.50 Euro. Combined with this the service was very slow and the staff on times quite surly. Other problems included extra items added to bar bills and people being charged for drinks they never even had. There are several restaurants at the hotel and we ate in most of them. The service here was a little better but the food was really overpriced, just like the drinks. The food itself was OK but nothing special. We were very disappointed with this hotel and would not choose to stay there again. We felt royally ripped off.

<Content>Estrel the Great The Estrel was a very pleasant surprise, after our booking at a more ''central'' Berlin hotel was not accepted at our arrival. Nice, clean, quiet rooms, new and enormous receptio - dining - bar area, excellent breakfast, and all at a very competitive price. We stayed at the Estrel during a business trip for an Exhibition and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The underground station is just a mere 2 minute stroll.Highly recommended

<Content>Adequate for a good sleep We stayed her ewhilst travelling on an Archers/Cosmos Eastern European tour in June 2008. As I did not know the actual cost of a room I could not assign value for money because expected quality must be related to price. This hotel was perfectly adequate for a good quiet night鈥檚 sleep in a large air- conditioned room with comfortable big beds and good bathroom facilities. The breakfast was excellent and in comfortable surroundings with items restocked by friendly staff. As a general comment regarding all our 9 hotels, the pillows were always so thin, or were so soft they ended up thin, that we always requested extras. They were delivered promptly at the Estrel. After long journey we were disappointed to see there was no tea making facilities in the room (this was the same in 8 out of the 9 hotels we used).Considering the hotel was massive I was surprised that it did not have a large gym and swimming pool. The isolated position of the hotel outside town means you do not have convenient access to the city for a stroll or to sample the nightlife in the evenings. This was not quite so important for older people, like myself, who only stopped 2 nights after tiring days of sightseeing. However, I would not stay here for a longer holiday. We did travel back to the hotel on the U-Bahn on one day and found it quite easy with one change required.I would not insult the locals by saying the area was seedy but it was not the sort of area you would choose for an after dinner stroll. We walked down to the local Lidl and did not find it at all intimidating.

<Content>Terrible Place I stayed here because of the convention that was located in this hotel. What a mistake. There was nothing good about place, nothing. Location, horrible bordering on dangerous. Make no mistake, you are a captive here ant they charge for simple thigns like a glass of water accordingly. And that's only when you can get serive to begin with.Service, slow and often times simply unavailable.Rooms, The worst. This place is like an old Russian prsion or something. Ugly and uncomfortable. No aircon and huge slabs of concrete walls to keep all that wonderful heat inside. Innaproporiate for the business traveller.Conference Rooms, what a joke ! Some were completely slapped together with temporary walls and often there were columns and blockages in the rooms. No two rooms were the same. A real mismash of styles and locations.Don't stay here under any circumstances.

<Content>Big but not great We stayed here one night before jumping on a train to Prague. The hotel is okay. The rooms are cheap looking Ikea decorated things. Trendy but cheap. The beds are not comfortable. They are thin and hard and the pillows are super thin; like putting a sheet under your head as a pillow. The bathrooms were clean and nice. Room was average and small as you would expect.Breakfast is above average with eggs, sausage, breads, cereals and more. Staff is okay, not overly friendly but not unfriendly. They are helpful in telling you how to get around town. It's a huge hotel so if you have a big group then it's a good place to stay. It's just around the corner from the Metro (about two short blocks) but it's in a slightly seedy area. We didn't have any problems even in the night walking around but it looks a bit scary. I think it's just very Berlin; the entire city looks a bit seedy.

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and I stayed in the Estrel Hotel in July 2007 for 4 days, the hotel itself is excellent, very modern, clean and has excellent facilities. Like most things in Germany everything runs like clockwork, the dining facilities were very nice and I would recommend this hotel to any traveller looking to visit Berlin. It is handy enough for Schonefeld Airport, (only one stop from Treptower Park), and is only a few stops from the city centre.The hotel is a short walk from the Sonnenallee U-Bahn station and although the local area looks a bit rough this will not effect your stay. (You take a right when you come out the station, walk about 100 yards and the Estrel is across the road to your right)

<Content>Luxe We stayed here for a city-trip. The hotel is very big and even has capacity for dinnershows, etc. The room was very big, with a real nice bed and bathroom. The view was also nice. The location is another story. It's not very ideal for a city-trip, actually, because you have to take the tram to the centre. If i remember correctly, you even had to take two trams. But the hotel itself was very good. The breakfast was incredible. Loads of food and variety. And a very nice, light, breakfast room.

<Content>Great Hotel! After staying at the Estrel Hotel in Berlin during August, I was very impressed with the stay. The Hotel is the biggest in Europe, and as I work for a multinantional company, many of my collegues have stayed here before, and have always been impressed. The Estrel features a wide selection of restaurant choices, from traditional German, to Asian and French. The rooms itself are spacious and clean, not at all like the other person wrote in the review below. The Las Vegas style show was extraordinary, with great music and effects. The large conference area is equipped with the latest technology, and our conference over the weekend was very succesful. I hope that I will be able to return soon to this Hotel, which is excellent for tourists and businessmen alike!

<Content>Not again, this place is horrible Because of an on-going conference, I was forced to book a room at theEstrel. What a place. It might be great for some bus loads of tourists or school trips to the capital but definitely not for business. You feel you arrived in an American Shopping mall with somelow key Las Vegas entertainment. Because we were late, we decided to eat in one of the restaurants. We choose the Italian place. The food was bad and the services really unfriendly. When I arrived in my roomI thought I can't believe it - charming like a road side Etap Hotel. It was dirty, smelled badly and was noisy. No coat hangers, no hair dryer, not enough towels - may be they thought I should bring my own or they are afraid that they are getting stolen. The Estrel doesn't meet any Hotel standards, even if its for pleasure, party type of stay in Berlin.

<Content>Hated it Terrible rooms, run down facility on the outskirts of Berlin. in a very questionable area (some areas had the feel of an industrial wasteland). Mediocre service. I would not stay here unless you have to due a conference.

<Content>only for business While attending a 5 day conference, I spent two nights at the Estrel because I had to participate late in the evening or very early in the morning on two days. I was glad to be able to return to my usual accomodation in the city after two nights. The hotel itself is not bad; the rooms are bigger than average, clean and comfortable. I found the breakfast to be very good, and the personnel friendly. I found the restaurant area to be too noisy - it's more like a food court in a shopping center than three distinct restaurants, as they claim them to be. I abandoned my initial plan to invite a friend to their top-notch restaurant Sanssouci, as it does not look at all as classy as it seems on the web site. The biggest drawback of the hotel, however, is its location, as others have stated before. The hotel was chosen as a conference venue for its sheer size, as it was the only hotel in Berlin able to accomodate that many people. The hotel hosts a star look-alike show, which looks cheap judging from their advertisements, and gives an idea about the non-business public they try to attract. Definately not a 4 star hotel.

<Content>Estrel This is a hotel to avoid. Looks great from outside especialy in the picture, never less it is located good 40 minutes from the center. If you are there as a turist or on a business this is a problem already. If you come for a conference like I did, it is a great dissapointment. Service is slow, unfriendly and in general no good, high overcharge for food, phone and internet, hotel personnel uses the guest's elevators to transfer their dirty beddings, food and dirty dishes. Rooms are average, however lacking even a coffe machine. Ice machines are non-existant. Originaly hotel informed me that they have a high speed internet acces in the rooms. Not true, internet is accesable only if you have your own WLAN card and ONLY from the main hall and -of course- for a substantial fee.In conclussion, I will never come again.

<Content>Conference only- in the middle of nowhere!!! The hotel Estrel Hotel is enormous and looks like a casino. Its absolutely miles from the centre of Berlin. Don't bother staying here if your a tourist- if you have to because of a conference.(Which would then be bad luck!) Good luck if you find the ice machine which is supposed to be on a floor. Rooms are very ordinary but have the modern facilities.I do not want to write anymore about this hotel as it is extremely boring!!!We left and found a great hotel called Hotel Kastanienhof in Mitte. This area is fab because of the historical signifance to Germany.What to Do: Catch open bus around Berlin- see everything.Checkpoint Charlie a must. Drinks at Grand Westin Hotel - Mitte...Dinner at Berlin Hotel. Crosses at the Wall. Berlin Catheral, Brandebburger Tor....etc.etc.Overall Berlin is an expensive city but interesting for its historical value. A little too big for me. Give me Prague, Paris, Rome etc...

<Content>very disappointing hotel Overall I was very disappointed about the hotel. I was there for a global conference (Airline) so I was expecting to see at least some sense of global standards when it came to the hotel. Was I wrong, now I am not one to be petty, however, one would cetainly expect a hotel/conference center that claims to be the largest in Germany to have have a clock radio in the room, or a small coffee maker, individual ammenities for daily use instead of unitype orange colored hand/hair and body soap. The use of a iron and ironing board for more than 30 minutes whether you're done or not, it goes. Hotel restaurants that don't run out of food during lunch, The so called fitness center consisted of 1 treadmill, 1 stationary bike and 1 lifting machine and unless you're there at 0500 to workout, you can forget about using the equipment. This again is for a hotel that has 1,100 rooms.People posted the hotel was in the middle of no where and they were exactly right. Cab rides to/from the more active parts of the city were 19-24 euros and as much as the transit system was excellent, (I took it from Tegel to the hotel for 2e) spending a good amount of time on the train or bus is not what I would want to do again when visiting as I prefer walking. Could this be a very nice hotel, yes, but it has plenty of work to do to get there.

<Content>Great Hotel but a little bit far... Great hotel - Very large room compared to normal european room. A little far from most tourist attractions (example: Approximately 20-30 minutes by S-Bahn to Brandenburg gate). Although close to a S-Bahn station, you need to tranfer to another line or the U-Bahn to go to most places.
