<Content>Disappointing, after all these years... I have been staying at the Capri since 2001, when my family moved from SF to the North Bay. It used to be a great deal for us ex-pats and while not a luxury hotel, it was clean and comfortable (plus in a great location).My son and I stayed at the Capri this summer and we were terribly let down. They no longer offer specials and while there is renovation occurring, our room was dingy and the bed very uncomfortable. My 9 year old son said, Mom, let's not stay at the Capri anymore. Sadly, I had to agree.

<Content>Overpriced, no wifi Paid $99 for a Thursday night King room. Entire property looks worn-out and used. Shower door wouldn't even shut properly, and the 1960's decor (especially in the bathroom) was frightening instead of charming.Their wireless network has an extremely weak signal, which I could not even connect to standing out on the open balcony directly across from their main office (about 20 meters away). They could not fix this issue when I called the main desk. Fail.If you can stay at this place for under $70, then maybe it would be worth your trouble, otherwise, stay away.

<Content>Great Hotel and location First to say the hotel has changed management (not ownership) and has had a facelift, rooms have been decorated, new comfortable beds etc and a lot of the old staff are no longer in situ, so although I have stayed many times I was pleased with the changes, what is good about the place is the reasonable rates and the location, 2 blocks from shops, bars and restaurants on Union and 3 blocks from more of the same on Chestnut with buses going anywhere you want in the City from either street, add to that a 20 minute walk to the tourist trap AKA Fishermans Wharf and the area is as clean and safe as anywhere in SF, It all adds up to the ideal location for a reasonably priced base in the area.

<Content>Terrible service ,rude adn unorganized!! My daughter wanted to treat us to a stay in the city to visit her and made the reservation, left her card to charge it to. The next day starting at 11:00 they called our room twice to remind us to check out at 12:00, Then the maid came in with her key at 11:30 even though the do not disturb sign was out. When we checked out they only wanted to charge us, not my daughter as previously arranged. A phone call between them finaly settled it with much trouble. They seem like they are not very together and their atttude is rude. Last time we will stay there. There are plenty of places in that area .

<Content>A New Home in SF I now know where I will stay whenever I visit San Francisco. A fantastic location in the Marina District within blocks of Union Street or Lombard Street shopping and dining. An easy walk to Pier 39 and the cable cars, and one bus a couple of blocks away that will take you to Golden Gate Bridge / Presidio and then Golden Gate Park, and another that will drop you off a block from ATT Park -- who could ask for more.The staff was not only friendly but amazingly helpful ( I arrived in town 730 am and they not only allowed me to check in they didn't charge me extra for it).

<Content>Not Bad for the price. Well the bed was uncomfortable but everything else was average. Room was clean and area was safe. There appeared to be plenty of parking and it was in a good location in Marina District. I'd say it was average because of the good location.

<Content>Terrible! I booked five rooms for my out-of-town friends for an engagement party. Two days before all of my friends arrived, the hotel canceled ALL of the reservations and offered NO help finding new accommodations. Although they lied about a boiler room problem I believe the got an offer at a higher rate so my friends were out on the street. It's not worth the risk.

<Content>They stole your $$$? What noise? I was interested to see the reviewer's comments about the Motel Capri being too noisy. I'd be interested in hearing how he/she found it to be too noisy - was it street noise, noisy neighbours, what? We stayed there for about 10 days in March 03 and didn't find it noisy at all. We found most of the staff pleasant and helpful, although there was one who had a severe attitude problem. From our overall experience, it's very good value for money. We just love San Francisco and can't wait to return. And yes, we'll stay at the Capri again. Regards to y'all from down under!

<Content>They stole my $$ I have stayed at the motel many times (a regular customer) it is always noisy but for the price you could not beat it. But the last time we stayed it was too noisy and after attempts to get management to do something (they refused) and trying to sleep we checked out 3 hours after checking in. We were told our CC card was refunded only a week later to find it was not Ten telephone calls and many weeks the management would not return calls and finaly refuses to refund my money, even though I have a refund (they have refused to finalize the process) as of todays date no refund which is in my book stealing my money.This is comming from a Regular customer how would they treat a one time visitor ?/???

<Content>Cheap chic! I'm glad to hear it's still a great value! I stayed some years ago and found it very clean, comfortable and quiet, with nice management and plenty of retro atmosphere (the neon sign shone right in my window, just like in an old movie).

<Content>Perfect and Inexpensive Spot in Cow Hollow Whenever you just feel like spending a day or few browsing Union Street shops and pubs, or spending some quality time savoring Marina district life on Fillmore and Chestnut streets, and want to be a mere short walk from the Marina Green or an easy bus ride to North Beach, Chinatown, Union Square and the Financial District - and you don't want to spend a lot of money to sleep in a clean room in a very safe location - this is definitely the spot.

<Content>Best Deal in the Marina If you don't mind 1960's decor this place will fit the bill. It's very reasonable and very clean. Sometimes it books up with the Euro tours. Ask to stay on the 3rd floor, with the high ceilings and roof windows. I have actually heard the fog horns at night. There is also plenty of free parking right on-site.This hotel is right off Union street and within walking distance of the Marina Green. Tons of great restaurants and clubs. One of my favorites is the Brazen Head, which is right across the street. A small English Pub with great food and drinks. It's hard to spot but there's a real small sign out front. Also, El Canasta (sp?) has a great steak burrito.
