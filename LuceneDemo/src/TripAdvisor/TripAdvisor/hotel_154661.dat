<Content>OK property to spend a few nights Hotel Fontan was an average property. Great location - 1/2 a block from Hidalgo Metro station as well as Avenida Juarez and Alameda Park. My room was quiet but sparsely furnished. There was a comfortable enough bed but no clock radio or city information. The hallways were dark and there was maintenance on the elevators. The rooms could definitely be upgraded and have more amenities put in. On the plus side, the breakfast buffer (99 pesos) was very good with great selection of fruits, entrees, etc.

<Content>Great value and location...a little noisy. Great value... a little noisy.I cant believe some of the other reviews. I paid $35 online and felt like I got a really good deal. The walk up rate was more than twice the online rate.The room was nicely decorated and exceptionally clean. There is rarely a need for heat... so the room was a little cool... but the staff brought me extra blankets the moment I requested them. Overall, the staff was professional, friendly, knowledgable and multi-lingual. The location cant be beat for a budget traveler... steps from the best subway lines in the city. 15 cents per trip. Lots of dining choices nearby and convenience stores and internet cafes.This hotel is ON Reforma Blvd... so it is safe at all hours... but it is also quite noisy at all hours, especially the lower level rooms.If you are a light sleeper, do your research and find something in a quieter area.

<Content>Horrendous experience, couldn't wait to leave The best thing that this hotel has going for it is its location. It is right next to the Hidalgo Metro and walking distance from the Alameda Central, Palacio de Bellas Artes, and Zocalo in the historic district of Mexico City. The restaurant is also very good, with excellent service and a delicious breakfast (included). However, staying here requires so much patience and the incompetent and unhelpful hotel staff make staying here an absolute nightmare. The room was clean enough, but because you are located on Mexico City's main boulevard, there is a constant roar outside that makes it very hard to sleep soundly. We had issues with our bathroom plumbing and it took 3 days for them to change our rooms. The most frustrating aspect of the hotel is that you are unable to make outside phone calls. You have to call the operator and tell her the number you want to call and she will make the call for you. This system is inefficient and archaic. She continuously put me on hold and took 10-15 minutes to even dial the number. Sometimes she took down the number wrong, so I had to call back and repeat it. Meanwhile, you are being charged for all the wrong numbers, whether or not it's your fault. It took a full day for me to find a way to make an emergency-related international call from the hotel and finally I had to sit with the operator at her desk and dial from there. The staff was unable to understand and respond to the urgency of my situation. They were unapologetic and unhelpful.I will say that the hotel was also hosting members of a huge international conference during my stay, so they were stretched, but given the nature of all the other reviews, I would say that it's safe to say that this hotel is one that everyone should pass on.

<Content>The worst hotel I have ever stayed in If you want comfort, service, or standard amenities, DO NOT stay at the Hotel Fontan.I have just returned from a 7 night stay - the only reason I did not check out and go elsewhere was because it had been booked and paid for through a tour operator.Check in took 25 minutes - when I was finally shown to my extremely basic, small room I discovered that it did not have any of the amenities one associates with a large city hotel. It did not have:- a hair dryer (and the front desk could not provide one)- an iron or an ironing board (and management would not provide these)- a safe deposit box - a clock radio/alarm - and when reception was asked for wake up calls, they got the time wrong - by an hour- 4 days out of 7.- tissues, any printed material about hotel services or mexico cityThe housekeeping was erratic - sometimes you had towels or toilet paper - sometimes not. Sometimes your room had been serviced when you returned at 5pm - sometimes not. The street noise was incredible - and windows were not double glazed - in fact,there were gaps around the seals, so the sound made you feel as if you were out there in all that traffic. The beds were rock hard - and management, unlike in other mexican hotels, did not have any rubber overlays.Public areas were dirty, staff in the restuarant were unhrelpful, and the food provided (apart from the buffet breakfast) was really bad

<Content>Would stay there again! The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The location was good, next to a metro station. There were good food and drink vendors close by.There were some times without hot water, but it was usually nice and hot in the mornings. The room was chilly but not unbearable. Out leaky toilet was repaired while we were there, without our asking!I felt safe and comfortable and would stay there again. The quality of the hotel and staff was much better than I expected for the price!

<Content>I can dig this joint yes I can Well I had booked this hotel before I even checked the reviews and after reading them they sort of smacked of amateur travelers who did not know much about hotels outside of their particular comfort zones. This is my second night here - I have one more night and because there is so much to do here I may add an extra night, space permitting. I recommend folks to try to get a room on the eighth floor, balcony section because it does have views of Alameda Park and that crazy horse sculpture on Reforma. I have nice hot water and I can get the net via my wireless. Now I had to cajole the good folks who work here to get a password, the manager came to my room to see that yes I could get a connection so he set me up good. This hotel is yes, dated decor wise but I am not staying here for the decor. The free breakfast hits the spot and nearby are good cheap eats, a farmacia, a convenience store, a Sanborns and of course the main drag, Reforma which is interesting in itself.The TV has some english channels and CNN and Fox in english. For the price and location you do quite well. This hotel attracts business travelers and as one I have found the staff to be very helpful especially since I walk with a cane and have a hard time getting around. I have stayed in all sorts of hotel worldwide and I would stay here again just because of the staff. Very conscientious folks indeed. Heck, not a bad place at all. I take most reviews with a grain of salt but when I read the negative ones I had to respond from my seasoned perspective. Thanks for allowing me this opportunity.

<Content>Wouln't recommend it For the price I paid was ok. I wouldn't go back anyway. I stayed there 5 days on holiday with my boyfriend, we didn't have hot water many times, the room was small and old fashioned, but at the end we just sleeped there. At the front desk not really friendly. The buffet was ok, friendly waiters. The most impressive part of the staff were the bell boys, they went one night to find a bottle of wine for us and even cigaretts and they brought them to our room (for a quite big tip anyway).If you are there to visit the town, outside the hotel there's always Ubaldo, it's a 50 years old man that is like a tour guide. It's not cheap, but he brings you where you want and he explains you everything. Or instead there is an office in the hotel that sells trips, not too expensive.

<Content>checked out within 2 hours! We arrived and it took us 15 minutes to check-in. The process was very simple complete the form and get your key but as soon as a Mexican walked into reception we were ignored until they were assisted. When we arrived on our floor the lights were not on but discovered that they were on a sensor, which is good for the environment but not good for guests who have rooms down the end of the corridor because when you leave your room you have to walk back to the lift in darkness before you can trip the only sensor! I could open my door with my colleagues key we accidentally discovered much to our horror. The room itself was very dated, if you like very bright pink then maybe it is for you but the paint has been slapped onto very old wallpaper so you can image the quality of the finish. The furniture was basic to say the least and the bed was a disgrace. The toilet bowl was cracked as was the sink. But the worst point was that the window was single glazed, the window latch was broken so the window couldn't close and we were on a very busy street ( I know they are all busy in Mexico City! ). There is no air conditioning and in you want to use their wireless facility you need to be on either the 3rd or 9th floor! They also have no safes in the room and the TV reception is non-existent. We exited the hotel very quickly to find another local hotel and finally found a room at the local Sheritan (I can highly recommend this one!) before heading back to the Fontan to check out. On our way back up to our rooms we got stuck in the lift for 10 minutes, fortunately a member of staff was in there with us and could radio for help!!!This hotel did not feel safe - the windows wouldn't shut, you could open rooms with the wrong keys and their was no safe - for a city with such high crime we did not feel safe.If you are travelling to Mexico city do not book here, if you already have booked it cancel now!

<Content>This is a dump. I had to stay here when I was doing a project under the auspices of a Mexican cultural agency; they must get these rooms for next to nothing. It is a bit seedy and fairly rundown. My room looked out to a courtyard which was a surreal looking construction site. It was best to keep the drapes closed at all times. I don't think the decor has changed since maybe the 1970s. I had to pay a deposit to get a remote control to use with the tiny, cheap TV. I need a blow drier for my hair and the bathroom was not equipped with one. When I asked to borrow one at the front desk they send that the few they had were all checked out; they discouraged me from checking back. The restaurant was fairly cheerful; mostly buffet style. The food was OK, certainly more than edible, and the best part of staying there (which really isn't saying much). The location is also decent - on one end of the Reforma near Alameda Park. If you are on a budget you can find better places cheaper - BEWARE, do not stay here!

<Content>Bad experience The hotel was ok for a room to sleep in (a little run down). The rooms did not have AC nor heating and there was even one morning were there was no hot water. I would not stay there again.
