<Content>Charm and Comfort in the City We called the Siquieros Suite home for 4 lovely nights. The hotel is located in a perfect area, you can walk to great restaurants safely at night. The park and museums of Polanco are a stroll away. You can walk 5 minutes to the well-patrolled subway and reach the Zocalo or any part of the city you would like to visit for a fare of about 20 cents US. Our suite was perfectly kept up. The bathroom always had plenty of hot water with good pressure. The bed was firm yet comfortable and the multitude of pillows made it hard to get up in the morning. We took our included continental breakfast in our suite, as it was too cool to eat outside at the restaurant in the morning. Delicious, ripe fruit, great coffee, fresh squeezed juice, and breads were brought up within 10-15 minutes of our call, except Sunday morning, things were a little slow....Bottled water was provided in the bathroom at no additional charge. We had a small lunch at the hotel which was good, but the restaurants in the area are so plentiful, you should go out and enjoy them. The suites are cleverly decorated, and really make you feel as though you are in your own home. We do not like big impersonal hotel chains, and usually enjoy a BB or apartment when we are travelling, this was just a great find for us. The staff is very helpful and kind, they will assist with dinner, taxis, whatever you need. For an amazing upscale dinner try restaurant Pujol, and we also loved the casual Mexican dinner at Villa Maria with live music. English is spoken by most of the friendly staff. We loved Mexico City and all it had to offer, and Casa Vieja was the perfect place to stay.

<Content>a retreat in the big city Well, to begin, the hotel is lovely. From the floral-covered entrance to the door of each room, it鈥檚 just what one would hope for. The photos on their website are very accurate, at least for my room. So I am including other views of the room. I notice that a previous review included a photo of a not-so-lovely view from the room. Frankly, I was too taken with the decor of my suite to care about a view. I am an artist and was intrigued to see in which 鈥渁rtist鈥檚 suite鈥?I would be staying. As it turned out, it was Maria Izquierdo, a 20th century female artist known for paintings of women and children. I was disappointed that, in the very nice collection of art books in my room, there was not one on the artist herself. That would have been a nice touch. I was traveling alone to Mexico City and I was only staying one night at Casa Vieja but I would return without hesitation. The staff was helpful and I appreciated that the person who greeted me spoke English well enough that I could communicate with her about a restaurant and a taxi to the airport. The location of the hotel is ideal for shopping and museums. And best of all, Colonia Polanco has amazing restaurants so the very nice kitchen area probably would not get much use. Now that I know there is such a nice place waiting for me, it will make a perfect retreat at the end of a day of exploring DF. One caution: be prepared for the hotel taxes when budgeting for your stay. Also, not all of the staff speaks even a little English so learn some basic Spanish before you go. It will make the entire experience easier.

<Content>Casa Vieja - much more authentic than business hotels I am a single woman and travel to Mexico City for work a few times a year and always stay at the Casa Vieja. My colleagues stay at the business class hotels just a few blocks away, but the Marriott, Hyatt, Nikko, etc. always feel the same no matter where you are. Maybe that's important to some people, but when I'm in Mexico I want to feel like I'm in Mexico! The rooms are extremely spacious, beautifully decorated as others have described. The shower isn't ideal - not sure if it's the water pressure or the hand-held shower head itself, but it's not the best shower I've ever had. But everything else, including the amazing rooftop terrace, feels like you're staying at a 5-star Mexican hacienda.The neighborhood (Polanco) is very upscale and quite safe for strolling around. There is also a Metro station (called Polanco) a few blocks away which will allow you to zip around Mexico City and see all the sights for much less than you'd have to pay a driver. It's very efficient, safe, and the stations have some amazing murals.There are some terrific restaurants in the Polanco area as well - one of which is called Izote, owned by Patricia Quintana. A very gourmet take on traditional Mexican flavors. It's a must-do. The restaurant at Casa Vieja is just so-so, so make sure to get out since Mexico City has some very sophisticated restaurants.My recommendation is to get out of the business class bubble, leave your hotel, and enjoy Mexico!

<Content>Intimate and characterful We stayed for 4 nights in April 2007 and loved this boutique hotel. Each bedroom is colourfully decorated and features Mexican fabrics, art and artefacts. The rooms also have kitchens with complimentary coffee. There is a beautiful roof terrace where delicious breakfast and dinner are served. The hotel is located in the very safe Polanco district - we felt perfectly happy wandering about at night, and there were some excellent bars and restaurants within easy walking distance.The hotel staff were very helpful, and arranged an English speaking driver for us for a day. Please note that the previous review appears to refer to a hostel of the same name rather than this hotel. This hotel is definitely upmarket and fairly pricey.

<Content>Best hotel I have ever stayed in.... Anyone who loves ambience, wonderful service and location should visit this boutique hotel in Polanco, one of the loveliest spots in Mexico City. Safe, close to all the shops but more importantly, not just another hotel room with a bed and mini bar. The small hotel, only 10 guest suites all feature a kitchen, wonderful continental breakfast served in your kitchen, down duvets and pillows, wonderful little touches like magazines, books about the history of Mexico, live plants and decorated with accessories from all over Mexico. The combination of old world and modern conveniences blend nicely with the incredible service. I ordered a cup of tea one night after shopping and it was at my door before I hung up the phone and crossed the room. If you want something out of the ordinary, this is the place. Antique furniture, hand painted walls, beautiful old tile floors, and the most helpful staff I have ever encountered.

<Content>Mexico City- Best Hacienda with 1st Class service, charm, and attention This amazing historic hacienda is the best place I have ever stayed in Mexico. Some of the previous reviews scared me, but they were old reviews. The owner and management of this quaint hotel in the megatropolis of busy Mexico City was so peaceful, romantic, and so much attention is paid to detail, comfort and Mexican History. You feel like you own this historic castle. Located in Polanco (the most expensive and upscale district of Mexico City), you feel so comfortable strolling the street, walking to the park, and taking the metro. I was amazed how safe Mexico City is. Please do not beleive all the poor American Touristy book reviews. I would definitely not go back to Americanized Yucatan Peninsula (Cancun, Cozumel, Riveiera Maya, etc.) Mexico City and the surrounding towns reveal Real Mexico. My private Casa Diego Rivera Suite was beyond my expectations. I traveled solo and I am young. Great for all ages for a spluge.

<Content>Pretty hotel -totally ripped off We were never given an itemized bill and were over charged by about $1200 for a two day stay and although we are disputing the charges. The hotel staff has not been cooperative in resolving the matter. Con not stay there.

<Content>Fabulous and imaginative We stayed at Case Vieja in October 2004. It was a delightful place, each room was beautifully decorated in a traditional Mexican artistic manner. Brilliant colours and lovely furniture and fittings. Each room was named after a famous Mexican Artist. With only twelve suites, it felt like home. The service was excellent - understated service -something from the past. Brilliant and unusual.

<Content>Unethical Management The previous review of June 12,2003 was so true of this hotel. This hotel has the worst management of any hotel I have ever visited and they are very unethical (that is being kind). I also had prepaid and booked in advance but they did not want to honor my reservations on June 6,2003. After arguing for about one hour before they gave me a room. I saw no other guests in the hotel. After I checked out they charged my credit card , the card I had offered for incidentals, with over $340 for one nights room. The hotel will do nothing so I am filing a dispute with my credit card company. Do not do business with them unless you want to be taken for a ride.

<Content>This hotel is a disaster I visited Mexico City in late November, 2002 and am still trying to get satisfaction from the manager of the Casa Vieja Hotel. I booked and prepaid my room nearly two months in advance, but the day I was to arrive I called to confirm my reservation before leaving my home and was told they had no record of me. After arguing with them for 20 minutes the manager told me not to worry because although they were completely booked he would find a room for me. When I arrived, I indeed had a room and saw only one other guest while I was there. However, in the morning as I left, there was no one at the desk to check me out so I left a note reminding them I had prepaid and that I owed nothing. However, when I received my credit card bill for the card I had offered for incidentals, they had charged me for the stay. I immediately called the manager of the hotel who told me he would take care of it right away. I waited in vain. Many calls and emails later, I still have no satisfaction. They have effectively stolen $360 from me.

<Content>Atmosphere in Polanco Area Eight suites hotel on a side street, but walking distance of top-shelf shopping and very good restaurants (and a couple of major hotels), tight spaces with kitchens, satellite TV, and music system. Dining in a charming terrace, with able chef anxious to please. Best suited for visitors wanting a boutique hotel in which to relax and not needing much service. A little problem with a no-show at the restaurant resulted in having to order pizza (Staff did not know of anyone to deliver some good Mexican food.) A request for a taxi to handle a day trip out of the city yielded a suggestion of one charging three times the going rate. But not bad if you are independent and resourceful enough to take care of your own needs.
