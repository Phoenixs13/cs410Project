<Content>Friendly, Clean, Convenient We really enjoyed our stay at this Inn. The beds were the best I have encountered at any hotel. Our third story room had a wonderful view of downtown Dallas. It was very clean and the folks at the check in counter were helpful and friendly. The breakfast offered was marvelous. All in all a great experience. We know where we will stay on our next trip to Dallas!

<Content>Right price My husband and I stayed at this hotel while attending the Texas State Fair in Dallas. The hotel is pretty much what we expected....the hotel was clean, the staff was friendly, and the price was right for the accomidations we received. The area is a little scary, as it is located in a pretty industrial area, so be aware of that when you book. Overall, even though the hotel was nice and comfortable, it was far off the beaten path, and we would probably stay at a higher end hotel. The Fairfield line from Marriott could be described as their cheap properties.

<Content>Excellent location, 5 minutes to downtown Dallas Hotel is across I35 from Word Trade Center and 2 minutes from American Airlines Center. Only 7 minutes to Pearl street in Downtown Dallas. Hotel was very clean. The best Continental Breakfast I have ever had. Had hot scrambled eggs, very nice eating area. Fully stocked ! Hotel seemed to be built in the last few years, one block off of I35 on Market Center. Price seems to be $85 per night firm at all times. Bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. Room was nice. FREE WIFI, nice work area. Very pleased with hotel,service and price was excellent for area. If you need to stay close to downtown Dallas this place is a great value and comfortable stay. Indoor and outdoor pools

<Content>great value My sisters family and my family met at this hotel for a long weekend with our children. The hotel gave us 3 rooms at the end of the first floor hallway and we felt like it was our little niche. The rooms were comfortable, clean and quiet. The indoor pool was a great place for the kids to play in the evenings. The front desk set out cookies each day at 5pm for the children.The website suggests a continental breakfast but it was more like a mini buffett. There were scrambled eggs, waffles, toast, bagels, muffins, jimmy dean egg and sausage sandwhiches, yogurt, and fresh fruit. We also had access to the Marriott Courtyard next door that served a $10.95 full breakfast buffet, and had a mini bar and kind of light snack grille open all night. We also had access to room service.!!The hotel is close to medieval times, the zoo, dave and busters, and pretty central to most things in north dallas. Great value for all the amenities that were offered. The staff also went out of their way to make sure we were accomadated according to our needs.

<Content>Smart hotel. Nice little hotel.Only had one night here but got to tell you, I had a fantastic sleep here. Very comfortable bed indeed.This small hotel doesn't have a dining lounge as such, but that's not a problem in USA there;s a Denny's right next door also bigger hotel next door too.Small swimming pool looked okay but I didn't actually use it.Free internet PC in foyer was handy to have.For a 2 Star hotel it's good.

<Content>Nice, clean affordable room The staff was courteous. I arrived before check-in to pick up my key and the desk person said that while the room wasn't ready, but that I could put my luggage in the room and she would have housekeeping get right on the room, however, it wasn't necessary, because I wouldn't be returning until after midnight. When I did arrive at that hour I did notice there was security patrolling the parking lot, which I also did on subsequent evenings. When I arrived I asked a maintenance man if he could point me in the right direction, and he said he would show me, which he did. The hotel was clean and the rooms were good size. There was not a charge for the wireless internet nor did they charge a parking fee which some of the hotels in the area do. They also have a continental breakfast which was staffed and replenished; it consisted of oatmeal, waffles, fruit, pastries, yogurt, coffee and juices. There are tables available to sit.While definitely not a destination resort, it is a well maintained property at a reasonable and afordable price.

<Content>Great for families My children and I stayed at this place when my husband was in the Baylor Rehab Hospital. They offered a Baylor discount and it made the stay alot more reasonably priced compared to others in the area of the hospital. The kids and I really enjoyed the indoor swimming pool to relax with in the evenings after a long day at the hospital. I would stay here again if the opportunity ever comes again.

<Content>Comfortable stay; great bed! The Fairfield is a nice budget hotel, and the new bedding is extremely comfortable!I needed to be in the Market Center area very early one morning, and since it was just a quick business trip, I didn't want to spend a lot on a room. This part of Dallas isn't the greatest, but I was pleased with Fairfield's security and cleanliness. My only complaint was the musty, strange smell in my room. Once I ran the a/c for awhile, the smell dissipated (or I got used to it). Based upon my experiences with other hotels in the area, I was thrilled to have such a comfortable bed, a clean room, and a quiet a/c.The available breakfast was a pleasant surprise. Based upon other reviews I had expected limited choices, and was pleased to see cereals, bagels, boiled eggs, oatmeal, yogurt, waffles, fruit, etc. Should I ever have a similar short trip to this part of town, I'll stay here again.

<Content>Nice central location! We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel while on summer vacation. We had several destinations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, so this hotel was a nice place to make our daily outings from. The area felt like it was not the safest, however, there is security in the parking lot. Our boys were thrilled with the pool. The room was clean and very nice. High ceilings make it feel roomy. Breakfast was also great, although so crowded on Sunday morning that the line for the waffle iron was quite long.

<Content>I was pleasantly surprised! I was not hopeful when I walked into the lobby of this hotel, but my experience was really quite positive. The staff were very friendly and I was greeted with warm cookies. The one-bedroom suite I was given was very nice. The bathroom was dark and small, but the rooms themselves were great. I had a nice stereo, couch, desk, bed (with clean and beautiful linens), etc... The room was great - especially for the price I paid. The hotel was centrally located and had a beautiful outdoor courtyard that is shared with the Marriott Courtyard next door. There is an indoor and outdoor pool, hot tub, patio, etc... I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Not a bad place to stay Whereas this wasn't the best Fairfield by Marriott I've stayed at, it wasn't bad, and lived up to the expectations of the name. The staff was friendly, the continental breakfast was very good, and they were able to accomodate my request for a refrigerator.My only complaint is that the guest who previously occupied my room *hid* garbage underneath the nightstand where the maid couldn't see it. I only saw it because I moved the nightstand to plug something in. I would make 2 requests--To travelers: Don't hide your garbage where the maid can't find it. To chambermaids: Please move furniture to look for garbage.Notwithstanding, I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Not too bad if you don't mind al little noise Sure the rooms are clean, but walls and floors must be paper thin. Stay top floor to avoid noise. Of course, Fairfield Inn cheaper and lower on the totem pole than other Marriott hotels. Not all that bad for the money, unless you need to go to sleep early.

<Content>Better Choices Not terrible, but not good. The rooms were fairly clean, but we had some plumbing problems, and the hallway was stifling and smelly. We stayed here because the Wyndham Market Center across the street was full. For about the same price ($60), the Wyndham is much nicer, cleaner, more comfortable, and has a bar, restaurant, and great service. Would not stay at the Fairfield again.

<Content>Not the Best Room was good size, but decor and furniture below average. Bedding had stains on sheets, however rest of room appeared clean. Loud heating and a/c system. Not impressed. Area is not great, but there are several other hotels right in general area that might be a better choice.

<Content>sleep peacefully for 12hrs. I was with some friends over the Superbowl weekend and we had a wonderful time. With all due to respect the clerk at the time was a helpful little lady. I didn't get the name but she made maps for us to go place to have fun and shop. We arrived around 12:30 or 1:00 pm sat. 1/31. I would like to think your business for being so kind and friendly. Hope to be back real soon. How about those Cowboys?
