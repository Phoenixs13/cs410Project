<Content>Sewage smell in hotel Staff was friendly and helpful. The entire city of Florence has sewage problems. Our rooms had the smell in them. The showers were terrible because the water did not drain. After taking one shower the water remained in the bathroom. Sorry I had to spend 3 nights there.

<Content>Great Hotel The Hotel Unicorno was a great base for a long weekend in Florence. It is close to all major tourist attractions. Staff were very friendly and helpful, the location is fantastic, the rooms were lovely and food was good too. Before going I read that some guests had experienced problems with sewer smells but we did not have any problems at all during our stay. Great value for money, I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location...BUT !! We stayed five nights at Hotel Unicorno, with 4 friends,,,,,of the 3 double rooms we had, two were fne, but ours, room 209 although fine in the day, after midnight the room filled with a dreadful smell of what we can only assume was sewer gas.....as has been reported on other comments...I impress the other 2 rooms had no problem at all....which we think was because we had an inspection cover in the floor of our bathroom.On the plus side, the hotel staff are extrememly friendly, the breakfast is very good, the linens are all changed daily, and the location is superb....so my recommendation is stay....but beware of room 209 !

<Content>Smelly The Unicorno hotel in Florence is very close to the train station and very close to the center of Florence. The smell of sewer in the hotel never went away. The location was great and very convenient but only if you can handle the stench.

<Content>Would not return to Unicorno We stayed at the Hotel Unicorno 4 nights in September 2005 and had the misfortune of being in room 101, a dark room overlooking the inside yard of the building. This is a bare bones property, without any amenities. The room contains a bed, one uncomfortable upright chair, no reading lights, no desk, no table. Only English speaking TV station we could get is BBC. Room was fairly clean. Walls are very thin and you can hear everything that is going on in the room next door. While the staff is courteous, their command of the English language is very poor. The hotel is located in a busy area of town and thus very noisy. The hotel has a policy of locking the front door of the property and it cannot be opened unless you have a key. We tried to get out of the hotel at 5:30 am and could not find the night manager who has the key to the front door. Supposing there was a fire? The Unicorno is a 3 star hotel, however, it compares poorly with other 3 star properties in the area.

<Content>A nice and clean hotel in a good location We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and found its staff to be very nice and helpful. We like its spacious breakfast room and the variety of breakfast items very much. The rooms are large and clean. Before we went to Florence, I checked on the user reviews on this website and noticed some complains about sewage smell in this hotel. Having this in mind, I paid special attention to this complain when we stayed there. We stayed on the third floor and our room is facing the street. We didn't find any sewage smell at all. However, our friend who stayed in a room facing the inner courtyard did notice a slight sewage smell early in the morining coming from the bathroom. After they put down the toilet lid at night before going to bed, they noticed that sewage smell disappeared the following morning and didn't have the smell for the rest of the staying anymore. My suggestion is to ask for an upper-floor room that faces the streets, not the inner courtyard. Personally, I wouldn't hesitate to stay in this hotel again should I go to Florence in the future.I guess the sewage smell is a general problem in Florence as I smelled it very often while walking in Florence even in March. Obviously, this is an ancient town and you can imagine how old its sewage system is.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel We ended up in this hotel after our original hotel overbooked and transferred us here. It was not a dissapointment. It is a very nice hotel with friendly staff. The room was huge and clean. The bathroom was very nice. It was in a great location, we walked everywhere. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>we liked this hotel a lot! After reading the reviews on this page, I was anticipating a horrible hotel. But, I think the people who wrote the bad reviews must have all stayed here around the same time when there was a sewer issue, because it didn't smell at all when we were there. It was a very pleasant stay. The staff was extremely friendly and the rooms were clean. The place was really cute! It's also located in a great area in Florence. Steps from the famous Fiddler's Elbow pub and many other attractions. Loved it and would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Hotel Unicorno was awful! This hotel was by far the worst hotel we encountered on our 8 city tour of Europe (and also the most expensive). The room had the most terrible smell that we actually had to go out and purchase room deodorizer just to sleep there! The staff was unfriendly and the breakfast was terrible. I would not recommend staying here.

<Content>Disgusting smell The Unicorno Hotel is a simple, clean looking place, but the smell of sewer gas during our two day stay drove us out a day early. We had trouble sleeping, eating breakfast, or just standing in the lobby with such a terrible odor. We would never stay there again. We checked other hotels nearby and none of them had the same, terrible stench.

<Content>It Stunk!! This hotel was absolutelu disgusting. It had a sewer smell in it that just about killed us. When wwe arrived at the hotel at night, the young man at the desk did not speak a word of English. The next morning the two gentlemen at the desk pretended like there was no smell in the hotel. Other guests complained as well, but they just said they couldn't smell anything. We checked many hotels right by the Unicorno, but none of them stunk. We actually got terrible headaches from the sewer smell. I would never set foot in there again. The people at the desk were rude, not helpful at all, and we left after a day and a half. Warning, I would not stay there.

<Content>Hideous Smell! Lets just say that the smell of sewer gas made your eyes water. Upon checking in there was obviously a problem with the sewer. We brought it up to the man on duty and he pretended not to understand what we were talking about.  I would not advise anyone to stay at this hotel. The stench ruined our entire stay in Florence. Other guests also complained of the smell but the manager became rude and nasty when asked about it. Also, upon checking in the young man did not speak any english. Very difficult situation after being exhausted from the flight over. Manager also wanted to charge me when the smell drove us out a day ahead of our reservation.

<Content>Good location, charming hotel My friend and I stayed at the Unicorno for two nights in March, 2003. It was an extremely short cab ride from the train station; we should have walked if we'd known how close it was. It lies about 10-15 minues (walking) from the heart of Florence, and has a few restaurants/cafes nearby. Our room was small but comfortable. Very clean, had two twin beds, satellite tv, armoir and dresser. Our bathroom was tiny, but clean, and had a shower and even a (crazy box on the wall, not too strong) hairdryer. We slept fine, rooms were quiet. The breakfast buffet was also decent; cereals, breads, fruit, of course meats and eggs. The staff there was very friendly and helpful. The hotel isn't very deep, but it's tall--3 or 4 floors, with one elevator. It's a pretty little place, with arched doorways and sudden little sitting areas on stairway landings. If you are looking for a clean, basic and comfortable room as a place to stay while you are out and about in Florence, this is a good place. If you are looking for a hotel to spend time and relax in, it might feel a bit cramped. I would stay here again.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay We stayed in a couple rooms for 5 nights in mid-November 2003. Staff was very helpful, rooms were clean, beds comfortable. Nice location, easy walk to most everywhere. Windows cut down the road noise very well, but earplugs were helpful. One 3rd floor room has the water heater outside that you hear all night; earplugs very helpful there. The lift starts at the top of 10 stairs, so not appropriate if have problems with stairs. Yep, I'd stay there again.

<Content>Unremarkable, but perfectly good... We stayed at the Unicorno for a long weekend in May. It's located between the main sights and the station, close to the Arno, and within easy walking distance of pretty much everywhere. Staff were friendly, rooms were big, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was very basic - but the Italians don't really go in for breakfast. We'd happily recommend it for a safe, reasonably priced option in this expensive city.
