<Content>Cheap and Cheerful I booked this solely on price and I am happy with it for the 60 or so Euros I paid. If you arrive late into Schonefeld it is on the right side of town and is only a 15 minute taxi ride on the newish motorway. My room was a good size but basic and in a kind of extension out back. 100 yards from the U-bahn, which connects into the S-bahn one stop away at Neukoelln, so an easy trip to the airport. There is a large supermarket adjacent to the Neukoelln S-bahn to stock up cheaply. Definitely not a touristy area, just a plain suburb, but as you're going to use the U-bahn to get anywhere in Berlin the location is just fine. I had no problems getting back to the hotel at 2am as the bahns run all night. The entire travelling public seemed to be drunk but in a good natured way.

<Content>Good value hotel We booked this hotel because my husband was attending a conference at the Estrel Hotel, which is about 10 minutes away by bus or train. It is easy to get to from Tegal airport, you get the 109 airport bus to Jakob-Kaiser-Platz (about 1 mile) then the U7, U-Bahn direct to Grenzallee. From the station it's about a 1 minute walk to the hotel. The hotel looks as if it's been newly decorated, and everything is spotlessly clean and fresh. The rooms aren't big and there is no real view, but the decor is nice and the shower room looked new.The breakfast was fine, cereals, cold meats, cheeses, bread, pastries, loads of different jams and a couple of hot dishes, like scrambled eggs and meat balls.To get into Berlin you need to use the U.Bahn or the buses. It takes about 25 minutes into the centre, but we got a day pass, so used the buses and trains all day.There are several restaurants near the hotel, which were much cheaper than eating in central Berlin. We ate in La Serra, which sold mainly steaks and pizzas and pasta.The hotel cost 66 euros per night which I feel is very good value. Breakfast was an extra 8 euros per person.

<Content>Comfortable hotel A comfortable hotel albeit a short distance from city centre. We stayed here on route to Berlin airport from Poland with a car, parking was no problem although it was a little difficult to find following the map in the IBIS brochure.Breakfast was nice inclusive in 70 euro price (double room). Our room was directly above the main entrance and we did have a little noise with the main door slamming shut. The room was clean and comfortable and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends.

<Content>Charming, Friendly and Extremelly Clean! We stayed at this hotel for seven nights while in Berlin. It was excellent value for money and despite its location (abour half an hour on the underground to city centre) we would definately consider staying here again. The staff are extremelly welcoming, friendly and helpful. The hotel is open 24 hours a day which means that you can stay out as late as you like in Berlin enjoying the night life! The rooms are really clean and spacious, as is the whole hotel. We can't wait to return!!!

<Content>60's Room with 60' Prices A very budget hotel. If you are simply after a cheap but clean room I would recommend this hotel as the price is quite good. We paid around 45euros for a double for a night. The room had the most outdated deco i've ever seen but was still in good condition. Rooms have a mini bar and a not so dated on-suite bathroom.The hotel is near the underground and in a quite street so you can sleep well at night. All in all I would probably look for something else next time as I would stretch the budget to obtain something slightly better.

<Content>An excellent choice for Berlin!!! We've stayed at this hotel during New Year period of 2003-2004 and were delighted, for the following reasons:- Genuine 3 star hotel in a new and refurbished building with modern and clean rooms - Hotel staffed 24 hours a day so you can come in late at night without any problem - Rates very cheap: 49 euros per day, for 2 adults, with breakfast included is one of the best bargains in Berlin - Extensive buffet breakfast including eggs, ham, salmon, yogurts, a wide variety of cheese,... - Hotel is located 100 metres from subway station Grenzallee (2 minutes walk and easy to carry luggage from subway to hotel) - Grenzallee subway station on a direct route to get to Tegel airport (no need to change subway line with luggages,...) - Excellent english speaking staff who can search and get tourist information when neededWhen we return to Berlin, we'll definitely stay at this hotel once more.
