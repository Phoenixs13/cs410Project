<Content>Lovely and quiet I was just exploring the area and stopped and booked one night..Great escape for couples. Beachfront location, the beach is full of rocks but anyway is a nice place. Clean room . Good service.Near there an excellent restaurant..It is a place for people searching peace and a quiet moment. They have to improve parking I have trouble at the time of getting out of the parking there were cars obstructing the exit.

<Content>Loved It; Didn't want to come home! I'd have to disagree with a lot of the comments that I read. My family was just there second week of April. We had a lovely stay! The hotel was nice and very clean. The staff was very friendly and I thought that the food was very good! (worth the wait) : ) The kids enjoyed the pool and the beach. My husband and I were able to kick back and really enjoy our trip. Yes, you are kind of out in the middle of no where and I wasn't sure of what touristy things there were to do, but isn't that the point??? We loved the seclusion and having the beach at our door step.

<Content>, Nice Getaway This is a modest, but pleasant hotel. I have a slight disability (walk with a cane) and I found it easy to get around and the staff helpful and friendly. The beach is feet from our door (room #212..king size bed with sink and refrigerator). If you are looking for night life, excitement etc this is not the place for you...as others have said stay in San Juan. But, if you want to experience real Puerto Rico, you might want to start here. Route 3 does go right by the hotel...there is nothing to do about it...but within a few minutes we found some peaceful almost deserted beautiful beaches. Also, one can drive into the mountains north of Patillas for a day. We found ourselves staying close to the hotel for reading and swimming most days.Someone commented that the hotel's food was mediocre. We disagree. We had the best red snapper (Chillo) here and the mofungo was also very good. There are a couple of other options within a 15 minute ride for dinner, but the hotel food was just as good as we found locally.

<Content>2nd Honeymoon! We chose Puerto Rico because my husband had not been there in 20 years. The staff was very helpful, pleasant and friendly. Luis the manager was accomodating beyond our expectation. Everything was so clean, the crew worked Day and Night @ keeping it clean. Waking up to the sound of the ocean and the light of the sun, that's how I like to start my day. We saw baby turtles as they hatched and burrowed their way out, we helped mother nature guide them back into the water. Make sure you order a Pina colada or two, the young lady there makes the best.When you order food you can enjoy it in the open dinning room, by the beach or in the privacy of your room. I read a review about this resort, yes your room feels a bit humid, Hello is by the beach. I'm glad I didn't let this deter me away. Keep your fancy hotels, we found our piece of heaven in Caribe Playa! You can join us there in May 2008.Thanks you guys. Mr.  Mrs. Rivera

<Content>OKAY An average hotel - If you just want to enjoy the beach and only the beach, stay here. Be prepared to drive for an hour and half from San Juan by paying a lot of tolls( around $ 3.50). Since we wanted to visit all the places in the island, we ended up driving a lot of time and paying a lot of tolls. If you want to see the real puerto rico or non commericalized part this is the place to be. Right on the beach and the road noise was a bit loud during night. Turn on the A/C and you wont hear anything.No problem with the hotel staff and were helpful in giving us suggestions for places to see. I stayed for a week and i'm neutral on this hotel. No nightlife or tourist attractions nearby. This is secluded and remote. If you are a honeymooner and planning to enjoy it in the nature ( you know what i mean...LOL)..go for it and this is the best place you can get on the entire island. This hotel is mainly for Old people, family and honeymooners. If you are going to puerto rico to have fun and see around..stick to san juan.Peace

<Content>Location Versus Faciliies My wife and I spent a night at this resort on 19 November 2007. We arrived after driving from the west side of Puerto Rico and lookign to explore the south east coast of the island. Although we arrived after 2:00 pm, our room was not ready. We waited at the bar and ordered from their menu. I recommend you eat at a local restaurant and save yourself the disappointment. We were given room 3 in building 3. The room was spacious, but the furtniture was a bit worn and the A/C unit did not work properly and left the floor wet immediately in front of it. Also, some of the windows by the room door were broken and could be open from the outside. I noticed this problem with most of the rooms in our building. The room had a small fridge and a kitchenette, but the A/C unit was over this area and anything left over the counter would become wet. There is no phone in the rooms, and I could not find one once the office closed for the night. Like most of the rooms in the facility, ours faced the beach. The water was only about 20 feet from our room. There are plenty of beach chairs and hammocks to lay around in the sun. I did not use the pool, but the place has a nice one with an area for kids. Overall the resort is in a great location and makes it easy to explore the coast, but at $117.00 a night we found it way over priced for the overal state of the facility.

<Content>No crowds, I liked this place alot! I stayed for TWO WEEKS with a group of people and we loved it. I agree -- it is noisy from road traffic at night because of the way the place sits on a bit of land between the road and the beach. Some nights worse than others. You just need to drink a few more Tequilla sunrises before you turn in for the night! 'Frige in the room, stock up whatever you like. The rooms all open to the quiet beachfront. Wake up in the morning, hear the water, open the door and there is your hammock. ten steps to breakfast out on the deck , hot coffee is waiting, sweet ladies bring you your meals outdoors. Don't be afraid to venture out down the road for dinner. All of us had dinners at several of the local restaurants up  down the road and they serve fresh fish, chicken and local fare. You can walk on the sand in flip flops to the little open air place 100 yards down and it was fine. Nothing to be afraid of. We walked home in the dark, no problems. The management was great and can give information about the local restaurants, it does seem like everything closed on Sundays, and some on Mondays. They celebrate lots of holidays so it's hard to predict the closings. Little bakery down the road was good, pastries, flan, a hot lunch can be had there too. Many of the lovely old houses up and down the road are being renovated and this area is up and coming hot property, I can see the future. Just don't expect luxury rooms here, this is water, sun and no crowds. I brought my paint box and sketch pad and it was me and the iguanas.

<Content>Don't Ever Go There The room assigned to us happened to be in a part of the hotel which was very noisy. You have a lot of locals visiting family and friends staying at the hotel and they stayed there all night. They played loud music all night and the people were talking loud into late hours of the morning.I'm a Native to the area and now lived in the US for over 27 years.My father died and we did the funeral in Patillas, which is only 15 minutes from the hotel. One night after the wake, we parked in their main lot where there was only one space available, to our surprise the next morning our rental car's windshield was busted. A coconut had fallen from the palm tree and totally busted it. When we called the police we found out that this was not the first time this had occurred and in fact it was an ongoing problem. After our incident at least 3 other vehicles had been damaged by falling coconuts. The property management never bother to put a sign to warn their guest of a possibility of falling coconut s or debris from the palm trees. Just imagine if a coconut is to hit you while you are walking to your car or lying on a hammock at their so called beach, you would certainly not make it. Management is clearly aware of this problem and contend that they can't find anyone to knock down these dangerous dry coconuts. They never offered to do anything for us and basically ignored us for the rest of our stay. The beach is a rocky shore where you can't even go for a swim and the rooms have a moldy smell.

<Content>do not go there I have been here on 3 occasions but it has gotten progressively bad. To start I am a native of puerto rico. I moved to nyc city30 years ago so believe when I tell you that this place has gone bad. The rooms are in very poor condition a queen size bed is two twin beds put together. The sheets smell stale and moldy.the windows are plastic. Lots of moisture in the room. Pleasebring a bug spray ants all over your bed and the bathroom.The furniture is old and the drawers don't open. No phones In your room to call the desk for an emergency and cell phone service is poor you have to leave the resort for service. No clocks in the room and only one mirror in the bathroom. We spoke to management because alot of locals congregate on the facilities at night. I did not feel safe oh don't forget to feed all the stray dogs on the grounds. The beach there is not a beach its dangerous for swimming not even the locals swim there.so if you go please heed the warning.

<Content>A Beautiful Place for Real Travelers I can't believe all of the so-so reviews I've read about the Caribe Playa! My husband and I love this place and would stay there again and again. If you don't know much about Puerto Rico and/ or are a vacation snob, maybe you should stay around touristy San Juan or spend $600 a night at the Horned Dorset, but if you are a real traveler who doesn't mind a basic room in exchange for beautiful views and a gorgeous location, this could be a good place for you. Yes, the beach is rocky, as are most beaches in southern PR, but still very pretty. Wear water shoes. This isn't Luquillo. But there are plenty of things that make up for it. Dinners were delicious, the pool was always clean, and we didn't have any mildew in our room! And please don't expect things to be like America; PR might be a U.S. possession, but it definitely has its own culture and way of doing things. If you want a vacation that is packaged perfection, go to an all-inclusive instead and let others enjoy undeveloped, undiscovered Patillas.

<Content>Caribe Playa captures the essense of the Caribbean Previous reviews have done a very good job of describing the pros and cons of Caribe Playa. While it is not as luxurious as other accommodations on the island, the setting on the beach is not to be outdone. This is the place for the rugged traveler, willing to compromise comfort for idyllic surroundings. The food at the restaurant was very good. I found the staff to be very accommodating to our requests. My minimal Spanish language skills were helpful, but not necessary. I would also recommend that to reach the hotel from San Juan that the route through Humacao, Yabacoa and around the coast to Maunabo was easier than following Hwy 52 across the island.

<Content>Not for Everybody But Could Be For You Hoping to avoid the swarms of tourists and assorted tourist traps on Puerto Rico, my wife and I looked for something on the Carribean side of the island. The Carribe Playa Beach Resort -- and a rented car to explore the southern part of Puerto Rico -- sounded perfect. Yes, all my Puerto Rican friends shook their heads and asked, Patillas??? Why are you going to Patillas? but we stuck with our plan.First, the positives:The photos of this place do not lie. Caribe Playa Beach Resort really is right on the beach with some breathtaking views. Palm trees, beautiful water and sunshine we were lucky to have for our four days there -- it all looks too good to be true on the website but the views really are this amazing. There are beach chairs and hammocks all over the place to lounge around on, there is an outdoor restaurant with the same excellent views right there too. The water when we were there (November) was a very swimmable temperature. The staff was for the most part extremely helpful and friendly (more later) and the coffee in this place was excellent. The nicest thing of all isn't so much about this place as it is a commentary about the island -- I have travelled quite a bit and I have never met friendlier people than the people in Puerto Rico. We must have stopped to ask for directions a thousand times, and every time people went out of their way to help us. Strangers smiled at us and said hi. People constantly wished us good morning. There are a lot of people who are nice for the sake of being nice on this island. The not so positives: As long as you are not expecting to be pampered like a spoiled diva, most of the not so positives of the Caribe Playa Beach Resort aren't really all that bad. Still, you should know that the restaurant staff tend to take a while with your food, as in a very long time. Also, as many have mentioned, there is some noise from the traffic along the highway, which may disturb light sleepers. (I loved the sound of the surf lulling me to sleep, however). Of particular disappointment to me was the fact that the king size bed we were told we'd have was really just two twin beds stuck together and covered with a king size bed spread and sheets to make it look king size. I really wouldn't have cared if I had had to share a bed with my brother or somebody, but for my honeymoon with my wife, not having a big crack down the middle of our bed would have been nice. The water, while swimmable, is not what you might have in mind when you think, Ahhh, the Carribean. It has lots of rocks at points and it isn't clear as in snorkeling type water. Lastly, you should know that this place is FAR from the San Juan Airport, so if you have a late arriving flight, you probably won't get in until the middle of the night, and that's if you don't get lost, which we did (rather badly.)The roads on the southern part of the island are in general windy and not always in the best of shape. We ended up going north at times to Fajardo and over to San Juan anyway, where the infrastructure really did seem to be better suited to tourists. Still, we had some great views driving on the Carribean side, particularly going east of Patillas, we met friendly people wherever we were, and despite some construction down there at times as well, we felt good about getting to know the less-known side of the island. It somehow seemed more authentic, which is what we wanted.The only real negative about our stay which really was a shame and knocks this hotel down a couple of notches, was that in the middle of our second night, I awoke to hear my wife shrieking. I sat up in bed quickly -- what was it? A rat? A burglar? No. My wife was stading in a huge puddle of water. She had gotten up to use the bathroom and had instead found that the toilet had not been functioning properly -- it had kept filling its tank continuously without stopping, and had flooded our room. I walked through the water and turned off the toilet (rather proud of myself to figure out to do this after being awakened suddenly at 3 AM) and we used our towels to soak up as much of the water as we could. After the sun came up, I explained the problem to the hotel manager, who agreed to put us in a different room, but in the end, one of the maintenance guys fixed the toilet and we ended up staying in our original room. Not a huge deal, but if I were the manager of a hotel and I wanted people to come back, I would have offered us something -- a free meal at least -- if two of my guests had lost a good night's sleep and not been able to use a bathroom until the morning because one of my toilets didn't work. Instead, I had to pracically beg for this, and explain over and over to skeptical management that it wasn't us who had stopped up or damaged the toilet -- it just didn't work. In the end, they gave us a free dinner. Much appreciated. But if I hadn't complained about it, they would have done nothing. You have to go to Caribe Playa Beach Resort -- and the southern side of Puerto Rico -- with the mentality that even though it's the U.S., it's in many ways a foreign country, with all its positives and all its charm, as well as it's inconveniences that might annoy you when you aren't used to them. If you keep that in mind and are okay with that, then this place will be just fine for you (and also if you feel that toilets are overrated.)

<Content>Warm wine, cold water We stayed there for one night only and we woke up more tired than you can imagine. The motel (wouldn't call it hotel) was overpriced and noisy. We went to upstairs restaurant were we ordered some drinks. I ordered frozen margarita (very tasty), my husband ordered a glass of red wine. It was WORM and tasteless. Other problems we had were limited towels (one per person), cold water in the shower, barking (entire night !!!) owner's dog, very and I mean VERY noisy street, instead of regular windows some foil cover. The only thing I enjoyed was breathtaking view.

<Content>Romantic weekend with inconvenience We stayed at Caribe Playa Beach Resort in June of 2006. The view of this place is totally AMAZING! The pictures on the internet from the beach are exactly how it is, even better. However, the service and the place are something different. We believe that the rooms are outdated, and are overpriced. It's more like a family camp site where you pay $50.00/day than a hotel. Even more, we wouldn't call it a hotel, is more like a Motel. The staff of the motel do not have any training in customer service. They really don't care if you are satisfied or not. The beaches are just for you to enjoy it with your eyes. They are rocky and dangerous beaches. We had to go to another beach 15 min away from the place and pay to use it. The parking space is very, very limited and sometimes you have to park on the road and if you get lucky to find a space it could get blocked by other cars. As a result of this, you will have to wait for the motel staff to call every room to have them take out the cars. To eat at the hotel you have to make reservations an hour before they start serving and you have to pick between two dishes. The food is not good at all. For tourists, is really a bad representation of our cuisine. When we received our dinner the meat was completely raw and they had to cook it again.Overall, we had a good time not because the motel and the staff did something to make our stay better, but because we tried not to think in all the inconvenients that we had. If we are in the area again some other time, we would not stay in this place and definetely not recommend it to anyone. Maybe just to drive by and take pictures of the beach.

<Content>Room liveable, management should be shot twice and then shot again Recenlty purchased by a local rich guy that lives in San Juan, he let his son run the hotel. Juvenile, immature and unable to handle the simplest problems. Fortunately, an older more mature manager had just been recently hired to give the kid some lessons. All I can say is THANK GOD!The hotel has 3 units, one which had no running hot water. I watched for hours while waiting for cheeseburger has one after another customer came to complain about the hot water situation. The young lady who was in charge had no idea what that meant and certainly could not handle the unhappy group. She finally refused to answer questions or call anyone to take care of the water heater. About 90 minutes into my hamburger order, a young man, the manager showed up for about 5 minutes, listened to some complaints, got his dinner and left. That was the first and last of him. Another 90 minutes later, I got my hamburger. I was the first to order and the very last to eat. Good burger though.The rooms are nothing special. You have no choice but to use the AC because the windows have plastic covering them. Only the bathroom let in outside air. Phones? Well, maybe, maybe not.The saving grace was the older gentlemen that we met the next morning. Professional, courteous, and MATURE. It was a travesty when we found out that many of the people could have been moved to other units, but the young lady and her boss seemed totally indifferent about it.If the girl and kid are gone, this might be a decent place to stay.

<Content>Restful and Sunny We stayed with our families of two daughters,sons-in-laws,and three grand daughters. The rooms were clean,the bathrooms a little out of date,but for the most part clean. Any problems that arose were quickly taken care of. The main problem is the main road right in front of the hotel. the noise of the traffic which is at its worse between five in the morning untill you get up (quite early) was the main set back. It is at least an hour and a half from most major cities. A very good place to relax and enjoy the water and pool. The restraunt is quaint,average prices and the food is okay. You just have a long wait to receive your meals. We found this to be the case in most of the resraunts in the area. Would we go back,maybe. It is just the way it is advertised on line,so if you want a restful vacation,and plan on not doing much this is the place. If you want to see and be on the go,I would look else where. Our stay was 4/17/06 to 4/22/06. A.Calling,Meriden.Connecticut

<Content>Resort? Not quite...but escape it is The area where the Caribe Playa is located is essentially a neighborhood that occasionally gets invaded by some strangers (i.e., tourists) who want nothing to do with them. The men stand around and drink all day and the women cook and clean and raise children. If the women work, they are usually getting paid to cook and clean and raise children.The hotel was basic but compared to most of the surrounding community it was grand. I wouldn't exactly call it a resort though. It was Clean, which is vital for my princess-soul to tolerate. Quiet, which is requisite or cranky won't begin to cover it. Remote, which I prefer on my anti-social sabbaticals. Of course, 6 nights and I wanted to slash my throat if I had to wake to those aqua walls one more day. The stone floors were old and stained, though there was no mold to be found. The 1970's bedspread was untouchable. Thank goodness we brought our own pillow cases (princesses learn how to take care of themsleves, dontcha know).There is some management shifting going on and Louis has been hired to come and make changes but he isn't ultimately in control. The owner's son is the Manager and he basically seems to hate working there. They do not make any concessions to the guests and whatever you do, don't expect a refund if you cut your trip short. We had a family emergency and had to cut our trip short by only one night...we asked that they take our food bill, which was about the same amount, and apply it to the night so we didn't have to fork over more moolah...forget it! I got one ridiculous reason after another from the owner's son, he was not too pleasant about it and then proceeded to avoid me on the property for the rest of my visit.If the owner's son doesn't learn a lesson about customer service, he will soon have fewer customers to deal with. The food is very very basic...and yes, you do need to make a reservation for dinner, but even late afternoon is okay and one night the restaurant we drove to was closed and when we called the hotel, they let us come in for dinner. So the staff really does try to accomodate. The beaches are rocky and a bit narrow but the water is blue as can be. The water is tub-like as expected, but choppier than we might have hoped due to the coral reefs scattered around. At first I was cranky as hell about it. But we stepped out of our room and walked about 25 feet and we were on the beach. Once I settled into my lounger and slathered on the sunscreen (we're near the equator here folks, burn happens while you're applying the stuff, ask my forehead), I was pretty darned content.The dogs ran off-leash the entire week. The place was not over-run by strays, thankfully. However one resident dog of the hotel, an old mutt, followed us around to the point of annoyance and was there at our door every morning. When we complained we were told that it had been there for over 10 years and was part of the place. Very frustrating.We asked where we could get some provisions...water, snacks and such. We were told to go to the mini-mart at the Texaco station just down the road. We eventually found the town centre of Patillas and the local grocery store. The Texaco was indeed the better option.One place you must go to pick up food is the bakery in town. Louis will tell you which one...it is the first one you pass on the way to the town, on the left. The best guava/cheese pastry and some good sandwiches. And cheap. We ate more fried things than I thought I would ever get sick of. Fried chicken, fried pork, fried fish, fried potatoes, fried plantains, fried ice cream...we couldn't find a vegetable no matter how we searched. I never craved a salad so much. The house salad at our hotel's restaurant consisted of shreds of green and red cabbage and two wedges of albino tomato. Served with a watered down vinaigrette-if you could call it that-it's crunch was it's only grace.I felt for the women who work there...they start the day cooking and setting for breakfast, then move to cleaning the rooms, then back for lunch and dinner. They are all nice and do the best they can with the cheap fixings the owner provides them. Most lunch items are frozen foods reheated, except the quesadilla which is an artery-clogging cheese melt fiesta, but no flavor really. They do put actual alcohol in their $5 pina coladas though so you don't mind that it is a mix they make it with and not local fruit. The staff did try to fix problems when they could..when we got ants in our food stash they sprayed immediately and they were gone for the rest of our stay. When our mini-fridge conked out they switched it right away as well. Not much they could do about barely warm water in the shower and we had to aske every day for extra bath towels. Oh and you have to sign for their very used beach towels-- if you do'nt return them you get charged on your bill. They are better than the provided bath towels but you won't want to keep them.All in all this is an average stay. Your cell phone won't work unless you drive a ways down the road towards the Texaco...if you want to be away from civilization then this will do it. There is a KMart about 25 minutes away and the town of Ponce is about an hour and a half away if you need a casino...but it was all further than we wanted to move after lying in the sun. It is a basic place that wishes it was ritzier but doesn't want to spend on the amenities. But if you want to escape it all and be right on the beach...this is one of the best places in the area.

<Content>Beuttiful place--Bad Food After a 2 hour ride from San Juan we found the place. We wanted to find the Bar but they don't have one. We sat in the resturant which is very nice and ordered drinks. It was very dark we could not see how lovely this place was. The rooms are one step up from camping out Very old and dirty. When we woke up in the morning I thought I was in paradice.You are so close to the water,the beach and pool are great. Not only is the food at the motel bad but it is also terrible at all the local resturants.This is not a tourist area and you don't feel welcomed.

<Content>Just OK I booked 9 nights at this place via a travel site on the internet- with no refunds after I checked in- big mistake! The place is ok, don't get me wrong. The views are breath taking, and the grounds are tastfully decorated. The staff here is wonderful, and I give them an A+ in service. The food at the restaurant is good, but dinner choices are usually limted to 2, and you need to make a reservation at least an hour ahead of time- places to eat in the area are limted Monday- Thursday, so keep that in mind.The road noise gets to you - they are right next to route 3, a busy route.We couldn't use the pool, because it was dirty, and looked like it needed some chemicals added to it. We stayed 5 nights, and had had enough- so we left and didn't get a refund for the remaining nights. Next time I book a place that I don't know about, I will only do a few nights, and stay longer if I like it- lesson learned.

<Content>Would not recommend! My husband, 2 small children (3 and 5 year old), and my parents stayed at Caribe Playa in April 2005 for 4 nights. I would not recommend this place to anyone, but especially to people with children. The hotel is very far from the airport (about 3 hours), the road to get there is dangerous and poorly marked, and the hotel is hard to find. It is located right next to the busy road with no land in between. There is nothing to dampen the noise from cars and trucks going by. It is very isolated. There are no restaurants nearby. The nearest and only supermarket is 30 minutes away by car. The hotel restaurant is overpriced and has nothing on the menu for children. There are only 2 menu options for dinner, and the whole time we were there we didn't find it inspiring. You have to let them know whether you will be eating dinner there well in advance, or you are out of luck. Although the hotel is right on the beach, the property is extremely narrow and the beach is rocky and dangerous. You are allowed to swim in the tiny stretch of the beach as there deadly undercurrents right next to the swimming area. The rooms are very outdated, worse than motel quality. You do get a a refrigerator and a coffee maker in the room. We stocked the fridge with bread, cheese, coffee, and fruit from the supermarket and considered ourselves lucky not to have to use the hotel restaurant. I would never again stay in a place that is so isolated from everything else. There are many more places in Puerto Rico with better property and location.

<Content>nice place We stayed 5 nights. Beautiful views. Room small but clean. For part of the stay we were 1 group of 3 so we had the place pretty much to ourselvess. The grounds were perfect and very well kept. Very peaceful. Didn't like having to have a reservation to eat in their outdoor place but there was a nice place to eat up the road where they had fresh everything. You need a car to get around, this is the real Puerto Rico mostly locals. Didn't see too many tourists. It's not a grand place but a cute little hideaway with lots of privacy. It was so relaxing I didn't want to go home.

<Content>Not Bad Ive Stayed in Much Worse! I was very enchanted by the location of this inn. It is on a little bay of about 1/4mile in length. The hotel sits right on the beach. Its not a beach for walking or swimming. There has been some erosion from hurricanes. Although its a great beach to sit by and read and sunbathe or have a drink! The surroundings of CP are superb.The inn suffers from the cheapness of the management. We paid 147.00 during Xmas for a room which was a great price. But we only got coffee for one night and had to buy packets @ 1.50 for the rest of our stay. Why don't they just raise the price of the room and include the coffee?? There were several small instances of penny pinching like this that got on our nerves.Be forwarned that the restaurants near the hotel are open on the whims of their owners. Therefore the only reliable place to eat dinner is at Caribe Playa and you MUST have a reservation. We were denied food one night because we came in without one. We went to bed without dinner that night....This is a very rugged place. I felt like I was on Dominica and not PR. The pool was beautiful and it was not dirty. The rooms were clean but they were very 3rd world. There had been some hurricane damage that was repaired but noticeable. Its hard running a small hotel down there. This area of PR is very interesting. I wouldn't mind having a house there. This is the only hotel of any quality on the beach in that area. Its not that bad. Id probably stay there again.
