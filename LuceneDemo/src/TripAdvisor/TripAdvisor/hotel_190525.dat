<Content>Great value - highly recommended This hotel provides great value, a real boon given the falling dollar. I stayed there for the second time and found the rates very reasonable compared with other places in town. The location is directly across the street from the S-Bahn, an ideal starting part for traveling all around the city, and is also directly across from a taxi stand and close to the U-Bahn. Excellent restaurants within walking distance, with delicious local food at good prices. Stores and shops in the other direction. Breakfast downstairs for eight Euros is also good value. Selection not great but certainly adequate, and the fresh baked rolls and bread are excellent. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful, and speaks English. They also provided prompt responses when I made my reservations by e-mail. Rooms are small, but clean and adequately equipped. The free Internet and computer in every room is a real plus.
