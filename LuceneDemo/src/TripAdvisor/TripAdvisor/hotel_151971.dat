<Content>The place is solely for the locals! I have been visiting this part of the Island since childhood.It had been 12yrs since my last visit. Wow...how things change!We stayed at the Villa Antonio Beach front cottage #5...roll out of bed and on to the beach. That was what we paid forand nothing else.This place is primarily a vacation destination for the locals whovisit from various parts of the island. They know the drill andcome fully stocked with beer and loud music! Don't be fooled by the online photos.Where do i begin...entering the gates you soon get a feel for how the rest of the stay is going to proceed...the staff is friendlyand helpful, however that is where it ends.The room was depressing the furniture was old and dingy.everthing from the curtains, bedding, toilet seat, appliances, cutlery , eating table and chairs were just gross! Once the children saw the beach there was no getting outof this one.I had to track down a maid and ask her for a mop and broomand some disinfectant at which time I cleaned the place myself.It was difficult to understand why such a prime located propertywas in such poor condition. Who is in charge of maintenacehere? And why are they still employed? I suggest they get it together and make some serious changes. The place has so much potential , they need to clean house! A little paint would do wonders and some new furniture from a local wholesaler would be a welcomed addition. The rooms condition was simply unexceptable! So fellow travels....Don't go into this place withhigh expectations! It is what it is! MariaPennsylvania, USA

<Content>Okay family-friendly hotel on the beach We needed a place to stay for one night before diving at Isla Desecheo. Parador Villa Antonio, for all that it was the most expensive place that my wife and I stayed in Puerto Rico, was just alright. For two people in their mid 20's, it was too touristy and too kid-centric for us.We got a room with two double beds, A/C, TV, and a private bathroom for $115/night plus tax. This was about $40-50 more a night than any place else that we stayed in PR (in other towns admittedly). It was very clean but felt more touristy and more like an all-inclusive resort than other inns - there was a swimming pool, I think a tennis court, kids play area, and guard at the entrance to the parking lot. They make you wear a bracelet to indicate that you are a guest of their hotels, presumably to make you feel more exclusive for staying there. It was odd to me. Other places we stayed had a kitchenette or at least a mini-fridge in the room, but this place didn't. It is right on the beach, which is beautiful. There is plenty of parking, and it seems quite safe. I would recommend staying at the Vill Cofresi, right next door, over the Villa Antonio. They seemed to have the same standard of cleanliness, the same amenities, but also have a restaurant, which was quite good, and a fun bar area with great drinks. Both are quite family-friendly, but villa cofresi was more teenage-friendly and more energetic.

<Content>Noisy, dirty, and uncomfortable Based on the other views we expected basic, but acceptable. We've stayed at paradors before and found them enjoyable, but this was unbearable. The rooms were dirty, noisy, and surrounded by smokers. The basic room consists of a bedroom and a screened in porch with a kitchen. Unfortunately, if you choose air conditioning for the bedroom, it exhausts the hot air into the kitchen/porch through an AC unit covered with dust and mold. On the first floor were a number of retired couples who had clearly moved in for the winter and there were constant cooking smells. The beach is lovely, but on the second morning, a school bus pulled into the driveway and let 30 people off to have a picnic in the pavilion on the beach- complete with loud radios, laughter, more smoking, and filling up all the space to sit. This would have been okay for the public beach down the road, but not at this private property. It was impossible to read a book, much less relax. At night, the security guards walked around (also smoking) and with their walkie talkies blaring. We could only tolerate 2 nights of our planned 4 day stay and left. The rooms not only had a lot of sand on the floor but there was also a layer of grime every where. The management needs to decide whether they are going to be a hotel/resort for tourists from North America or a place for locals to party and retired people to live for the winter.

<Content>Great beach location We stayed here in a 2 bedroom beachfront cottage for 4 nights in mid October. The cottage is a little misleading as it is not free standing - the building is actually a 4-plex of 2 bedroom units, but it is beach front. The owners keep the property well maintained. The interior of the rooms could use a little work. The kitchen/living room/dining room is a bit small to prepare large scale meals - and you will need to bring your own pots and pans. However, it is great for breakfast, lunch and snacks.The bedrooms were also small, but we spent little time there. Each bedroom has a window unit air conditioner, which we used for 2 of the 4 nights. The breeze from the sea was sufficient to keep the room cool for the 2 other nights.The patio is incredibly large and where we spent most of our time. The breeze from the ocean was cool, and if there had been hooks for a hammock, we might have slept outdoors. Lighting on the patio was bright enough so you could sit outside in the evenings and read.The beach in front of the parador is great for swimming. The waves sound huge, but are small - they just break close to shore. One of the reasons for not turning on the a/c is to be able to listen to the surf at night. Bring your own beach towel.The Villa Cofresi is on one side of the Villa Antonio and we enjoyed dinner there. However, there was a large group there and it was incredibly noisey. We were so happy we were not staying there. The Rincon of the Seas is on the other side. It was also nice for dinner.The entire Rincon area was very quiet - it appeared to us that many of the hotels/guest houses were practically empty. Many of the restaurants were closed, as were the many of the surf shops. Apparently, a number of places close in September and then reopen in late October/early November. We looked for a handicraft store, but did not find one. The Lazy Parrot has some handicrafts and jewelry and Casa Islena had a very very small amount. The first day we were there, there was surf in front of Tamboo Tavern, but it was flat the rest of the time.So, if you like quiet, October is a good time to go and the Villa Antonio is a great place to stay. Based on our tour of town and other places, we would choose to stay at the Villa Antonio on our next visit.

<Content>Would Definitely Come Back! Parador Villa Antonio is the BEST place to stay if you want to relax on the beach for a few days. The hotel is right on the beach and the rooms each have kitchens which is great. I would recommend renting a car so you can take advantage of the local supermarkets. The Parador is definitely not luxury but it has all you could need with AC and television and is really great for the price.

<Content>Had a wonderful stay at Villa Antonio I spent two very enjoyable days here at Villa Antonio (I鈥檓 typing this review connected to an Ethernet hub available in their social room, taking the time to do so since I've had such a nice stay). The place is right on the beach. As another reviewer noted, you can open your windows a listen to the waves on the beach, and walk out your door and be on the beach in 30 seconds. The place is quiet and peaceful, and feels like a place that time forgot, with a bit of a 1960鈥檚 feel. I鈥檇 guess that the guests here this week are mostly retired but are very friendly; I鈥檓 guessing they鈥檙e returning guests year after year. There are optional social events here. Last night was pot-luck dinner night (bring a dish to share with others); tonight is movie night. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. They just won an award (4th place in all of Puerto Rico) for the best front-office reception. The pool is small, but the Carribean (20 meters from the pool) is huge. The little kitchenettes (complete with coffee maker) are quite convenient. If you鈥檙e looking for a party atmosphere or a fancy resort, this isn鈥檛 the place, as other reviewers have noted. But if you want a clean, extremely friendly, quiet, and inexpensive place on a beautiful beach, this is it. I鈥檇 definitely come back again.Some recommendations: Cabo Rojo (a nature preserve about an hour south, for deserted beaches, some hiking trails, and informational museum with friendly staff who can tallk you about the process of getting salt out of the salt flats), and Steps Beach (a national preserve in Rincon about 10 minutes north with excellent snorkeling, with reef fish and various coral right off the beach).

<Content>Great value, great location I can confirm everything the previous review mentioned. Rincon was my favorite areas on the island. Sort of southern calif beach town, mexican small town combo.We were very happy with the place and are planning on coming back. Great price, clean, right on the beach. And after 2 weeks around the island eating out, in 5 different locations, it was nice to have a kitchen. We bought some cheap local fish, at the neighborhood store and put some peppers and tom sauce and fried them up. GreatThe beach and sunsets were beautiful and water was calm. I personally like some of the surfing beaches, but they were way too rough for my wife to go out and play. And all the places near the surfing beaches were more expensive.

<Content>An ok place to stay Ok, we arrive at the Villa Antonio and it is arround 90潞 F and humid, we checked into our room with out any problems. We entered the room and we were a little surprised, the T.V. was missing channel change buttons, and there was no silverware(room had oven, stove, fridge, sink). Although the hotel did have wireless internet it was down apon arrival and did not work until later the next day. If you are planning to go diving in the area I would probably go to Taino Divers, they are very friendly but, be sure to reserve dives early because they can fill up in a matter of hours. Otherwise it was an ok hotel, the best resturants in the area by far are the Rincon of the Seas (the hotel next doors resturant) and the Lazy Parrot with a very friendly staff. (to our surprise the very crowded pool closes at 6 at night). If possible I would reccomend staying at the rincon if the seas next door it is very nice and the pool is WAY better, the hotel is a lot nicer and the price is not too much more i recall about $20-$30 dollars a night more. Also be careful on the roads of Rincon the drivers are very wild, fast, spastic and out of control.

<Content>Great place to stay. Inexpensive. This parador is nothing fancy, but for a basic accommodation right on the ocean, you can't beat its facilities and price. The beachfront suites and jr. suites are the places to stay. We got a suite for only $130. We were about 40' from the waterline. You could hear the waves crashing over the hum of the air conditioning at night. Clear view of the setting sun directly in front of you off the private balcony. The Rincon of the Seas is right next door, and though it is a completely different type of experience (sterile, resort-like), it is twice the price, and more setback from the water. The rooms are very clean and spacious here. The staff couldn't be friendlier. There was a basketball court, tennis court, and pool, but we didn't use them. Free internet access in their gameroom, as well as additional ports if you have a laptop. We stayed there early March 2005 and the beaches were nearly deserted, though that could be different on weekends, as this area south of Rincon is a favorite weekend and vacationing spot for Puerto Ricans. Most of the guests were retired Americans, the staff told me some of them stay for months and come every year. It is a very quiet place, if you want activity, stay on the north side of Rincon. The beach is relatively calm, but be careful with rocks near the shoreline, the entire coastline here is rocky, but certainly swim-able. The beach is somewhat narrow with alot of other accommodations as far as the eye can see. Explore some of the other nice beaches such as escalera (steps) beach, a short drive away. You can also snorkel there. Next door to the parador on the other side is Villa Confresi, which has an outdoor bar, have a pirata, a coconut and rum drink served in a coconut. One good thing about being at the parador is that you don't have to hear the music from this bar at night. Nearby across from the Rincon of the Seas exit is an excellent restaurant recommended by the staff, Rincon Tropical, with an exceptional whole red snapper (chillo) deep fried and topped with creole sauce (salsa criolla entomatada). Pick up eggs, bacon, and toast in the morning at the EC Bakery nearby for only $1.75 or cook on the kitchenette in your room. Our time here topped off an excellent vacation, we are already planning our next trip.

<Content>Nice apart-hotel but no entertainment Just got back from a weekend at Parador Villa Antonio. It's a beachfront apart-hotel that caters to families. They have a small pool, tennis court, and children's playground. There is no bar, restaurant, nor entertainment. However, you'll find restaurants, supermarkets, and liquor stores on the main road. Some are walking distance, others are not. If you're looking for nightlife, this is not the place to stay. The two hotels next door may be a better choice. Villa Cofresi (family oriented too) has a beachfront bar, pool tables and arcade; Rincon of the Seas (more upscale) has a pool bar, arcade and wine bar/lounge. You do not have to be a guest to go to either. However, they will not let you use their pool. If I were to return, I'd stay at Rincon of the Seas. They have a swim-up bar, restaurants (great breakfast buffet), and it just makes me feel like I'm really on vacation. Also note, you need a car to get to the bars outside of the area. The roads are narrow so be careful.

<Content>Peaceful days, gorgeous sunsets in Rincon After a terrible bout with Winter in New England, Rincon was the perfect escape for my boyfriend and I in Jan '4. We stayed at the Parador for two reasons- cost and proximity to the beach. We were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the guests and staff. The apartment-style accommodations gave us a sense of freedom and flexibility when it came to meals and relaxing indoors.The beach is literally on the property and although small, it is quiet and perfect for sun-bathing and gentle wave-riding. There is an excellent taco stand across the street with an adjoining liquor store- stock up on Bacardi, it is cheap! We made our own drinks and had moon-lit chats on the beach...very romantic.Make sure you catch the sun-set on the deck at the Parador; BYOB and snacks to share- you'll get to know the other guests.The grocery store is less than half mile away and the prices are extremely reasonable. It helps save on breakfast and snack items. The Guest Services at the Parador will procure fresh fish for you, should you want to make dinner. They are very helpful and knowledgeable about the area and how to maximize the fun of your stay.Highly recommend staying in Rincon, no matter what. A great beach town, very laid back and very beautiful.Other places to check out: The Spot bar and restaurant. Also, www.iloverinconpr.com for other reviews  places to go. HAVE FUN!!

<Content>Great location in Rincon We just returned from a two week vacation in Puerto Rico and spent the first 5 days at the Parador Villa Antonio in Rincon. The parador has a great location -- very close to the center of town, restaurants, shopping, and of course the surfing beaches. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the daily maid service was flexible about working around our schedule. We stayed in the two bedroom beachfront villa for $145 per night -- a good value for Rincon, which can be a bit pricey. The furnishings were a little worn around the edges, but the rooms were clean and quiet, and the A/C and everything else worked OK. The mosquitoes were a bit of a problem, but you quickly learned to keep the screen door shut. The kitchenette included a full-size refrigerator, stove, pots, pans and utensils; we bought food at the local supermarket and made our own breakfast and lunch every day which saved us money. The beach in front of the parador was kept clean and was great for walking; the ocean sunsets were magnificent. The pool was a bit small, but it was always clean and usually not crowded. There are two tennis courts, at least one of which was always available. The parador does not have a restaurant, but there are quite a few good restaurants within walking distance or a short drive. The hotel next door has a great beachfront bar. The surfing beaches are only 5 to 10 minutes away by car; we found the best waves at Maria's Beach and Domes. We were among just a few US mainland tourists staying at the parador; the majority of its customers appeared to be well-to-do Puerto Rican families from San Juan or elsewhere around the island. We found Rincon and the Parador Villa Antonio to be very relaxing and enjoyable, and we would certainly go back there again.
