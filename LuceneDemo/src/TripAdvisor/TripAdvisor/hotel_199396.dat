<Content>Reasonable Good location, great transport links, breakfast ok (not great for fried but ok for continental) beds VERY comfortable. However the rooms have no air conditioning which means you will probably not be able to sleep without the windows open during the summer as it gets stifling hot. The only problem is that if you have a room at the front the traffic is VERY noisy so bring earplugs. The hotel is likely to be fully booked so they will be unable to change rooms. One of our party had to change rooms as it smelled of cigarette smoke but they changed it. They also tried to give us a twin room when we had paid for a double but we insisted they changed it. (These were all front-facing rooms) There is a cool little place that looks like a coffee shop next door that does huge cocktails for 5 euro. We found a lovely Italian half way down Leibniz Str and more restaurants around Walter- Benjamin Platz

<Content>Great Location Stayed for three nights at the Kant with my wife, we were worried about airport transfer from Schoenfeld Airport , could not be easier took the S9 stright to Charlottenburg station . then 3 minute walk to Hotel .Make sure you get a welcome travel card at the station excellent value .We did not arrive until 10.30 pm so we asked reception to recommend a nearby Restaurant , the Italian across the road was excellent value and staff very friendly .The hotel we found very clean , the Breakfast was very good also, the drinks in the bar are a bit expensive ,look for the bar next door though a lot cheaper .Right outside the hotel is the bus stop you can get one of two buses from here to the zoological station area , very easy the last one returns at 1.30pm, but you can also catch the S9 again from the zoological stationgood night out is at the Irish bar in the europa centre live music until 3.00amAll in all we found Berlin and the Kant a good experience and will return soon

<Content>Good value/location Hotel very well situated for S+U bahn. If arriving at Schoenefeld airport S9 train takes you to S. Charlottenburg then 3 minute walk. Restaurants and bars all within walking distance, or again easy links to centre stations.Staff very friendly both at check in and breakfast; breakfast itself basic but good choice and always restocked.Hotel and rooms very clean; only downside was the bathroom, or should say showerroom. No bath in our room although some have them (as a group, out of 7 rooms, 2 had baths). Bear it in mind when booking if you like a soak. Other than that would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Liked the Kant Very convenient. Enjoyed staying in this part of Berlin. Great shops, restaurants play facilities. Fabulous transport links. Everything cheap and good quality.We had a problem with our room on the first night. It was too small, and overlooked main road. Moved on the second day to a larger room, refurbished and overlooking the courtyard. Peaceful. Enjoyed breakfast.All in all, a great week's stay would go back.The brochure did say complementary coffeee available 24/7 - not the case except at breakfast.Staff knowledgeable and helpful except when sending us to the long closed Egyptology museum.Looking forward to going back to Berlin and the Kant soon.

<Content>A reasonable choice This hotel is very convenient for both the S bahn and U bahn transport systems being only about 2 minutes walk from both. The young staff were all very helpful and all spoke far better English than my limited German. The breakfast was adequate but a tour group sat before us ate all the bacon and despite a request for more none was forthcoming. The room was clean but if I stayed again I would ask for a room on the inside rather than one overlooking the main road as that turned out to be rather noisy if you kept the window open - there was no air conditioning.
