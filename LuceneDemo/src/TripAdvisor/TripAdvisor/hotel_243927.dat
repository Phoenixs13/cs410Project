<Content>Nice little Place, service with a Smile! My wife and I recently spent a Month in Arizona, the night before we were coming home to Idaho, we had the opportunity to come accross a Motel 6 in Phoenix near the Phoenix Airport.We were tired and the location near the rental car center and the airport was excellent.. After check in we asked the gentleman wworking the desk where we could grab a quick bite to eat, the staff at this hotel gave us numerous suggestions and wef ound ourselves at a wonderful local place. Check in was pleasant, staff was wonderful and the room was clean, comfortable and smelled nice.I would defintly recommend this Motel 6, our past experinces with Motel 6 have been so-so, but this hotel was excellent.

<Content>Don't Stay At This Hotel Items were missing out of room. After housekeeping was in. Little misc. items that you would not realize were gone until you went for them. When reported the manager accused of leaving door open. Also after reporting them. I was considered a disturbance and can not stay at any other motel. Guest relations can not provide any information. In how to speak to upper level management.

<Content>Convenient for early flight Standard Motel 6 room. Friendly reception.Convenient location if you have to get an early flight and have a car with you. Unfortunately no pick up service.A bit noisy because of the railroad next to the motel.

<Content>Stay here only if you need to save a few dollars. Here are the things that I found lacking.1. Shampoo2. TV set quality and reception3. Safety, like if I wanted to walk to find something to eat.4. Quiet. It is next to train tracks and the airport runway. The train whistles blew loudly in the early morning and the planes took off noisily. I would stay there again if I wanted a plain room for a bargain (for Phoenix) price, but only if I had a car to drive to find supper. The room was clean and the people were friendly.

<Content>2 star neighborhood The property is not locate in a very nice neighborhood, it does not have a laundromat and the staff wasn't especially friendly. However, the room was clean and the pool was fine.

<Content>Good location but noisy. Good location, few blocks from Sky Harbor Intl. Airport. Check-in took us 20 minutes because we were 9 friends, we all had to show the passport. Some Motel 6 properties only ask one per room. Rooms were standard, nothing fancy but no complaints. AC was too cold but we adjusted the temperature with separate control. The only bad news was the terrible noise coming from train horns every 30-45 minutes, late night and early morning included. Believe me, that could wake up anyone. We could not sleep well and left at 5 am, the airport was close but next time we will look for a property in a quiet area.

<Content>Good for a night after flying long haul Arrived at the motel after a long haul flight from London that arived in Phoenix 25 hours late after two unscheduled stops en-route. The room was all right, nothing fancy just a standard motel room. The facilities for a one night stay were fine. The reception staff were OK especially the woman the following morning who was extremely helpful in pointing us in the right direction for Las Vegas missing out traffic lights and road works and heavy traffic. On return to Phoenix 17 days later after travelling arond Nevada and Arizona we pulled into the car park to stop befoire handing the car in and it looked better than the first impressions on the first night.The 24hr Waffle House next door was good for breakfast.Location is very good for Sky Harbor Airport and for the car rental pick up and drop off points
