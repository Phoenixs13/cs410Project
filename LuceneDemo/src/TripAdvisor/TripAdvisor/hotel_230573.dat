<Content>Good deal We stayed there because a friend had recommended it to us. Our first impression from the homepage was: ugly design, horrible colors. In reality it turned out to be a nice hotel, clean and at a good price. The design isn麓t really fancy, but not ugly. The room was very clean, spacious and very quiet. The hotel is situated in a rather boring but safe area of Berlin, there are not many restaurants nearby, but two supermarkets are around the corner. But therefore it is directly at Tram M10, which will take directly to the cool Kastanienallee/Prenzlauerberg area within 5-10 min. Alexanderplatz is about 8 min with Tram M5 and 6. The breakfast buffet was really nice with a large variety. On Sunday we joined the brunch buffet in the restaurant, which was rather boring - take the regular breakfast, it is cheaper and better.
