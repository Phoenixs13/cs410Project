<Content>Bit strange but OK We stayed a night here at the end of October prior to taking an early morning flight out of Schoenefeld. The hotel is about a mile or two from the airport and the inclusive shuttle service is a bonus given the price of taxis. As it happened we didn't use that as we had a hire car, but it seemed to be working well. Otherwise there is an S Bahn station a short walk from the hotel which is one stop from the airport. For an airport hotel we got a fantastic rate throught he hotel's website - E44 excluding breakfast, which would have cost 10 euros more each, but we were flying too early to make it worthwhile.What's very weird about this place is that it is clearly a converted block of apartments in the middle of a residential area of mixed quality. The room size was generous, with a seating area to enjoy the flat screen telly, but the walls were uneven where you could see walls had been demolished and the scars were inadequately covered by the woodchip wallpaper. Strangest of all, the previous balcony to the room had somehow been incorporated into the room and windows fitted, so you walked through a gap in the wall - with no door, just a curtain - and found yourself outside the room in a narrow sort of annexe with no apparent function. Very bizarre, but perhaps it was to keep the airport noise out.. There were no frills - no mini bar or drinks facilites of any kind, and there was just a shower in the bathroom, no bath. It was clean and spacious and the bed was OK.What I found most annoying was that we had a room at the front and it rained heavily all night. We were on the fourth floor and I was kept awake all night by the stream of water cascading down onto the plastic canopy over the entrance - there was a major problem with the guttering, which should have been sorted. Not the best start to a busy day.All in all I would have to say it was good value and I might stay there again - just not in a front room if it was raining!

<Content>Great Stay, Very Convenient Very convenient for our purposes. We were only in Berlin for one day, flying in from London early in the morning, picked up from the airport in the hotels courtesy bus (Free), then we were able to early check-in and freshen up before off to sight see in and around Berlin for the rest of the day. Easy excess to the train (station is walking distance from hotel). The next day we took advantage of the free coutesy bus back to the airport to pick up a hire car to continue our tour through Germany.Very friendly staff, great hotel suited to our purposes. A lot better than carting all our luggage all around Berlin to stay closer to the City. The hotel is only about 30 mins on the train to the city which runs frequently. From the top floors you have the views of the surrounding area. We found the hotel had all the mod cons that you would expect without all the bells and whistles of a 5 star hotel. Large flat screen TV, fantastic beds and great breakfast room in which we had a full breakfast (extra cost, but worth it).Overall a great place to stay if it suits staying out of the main Berlin city area. Price was reasonable also, we paid $AUS213 for 4 people with full breakfast.

<Content>Very decent airport hotel The airport hotel Schonefeld is located one S-Bahn station away from the airport but it also provides a complimentary shuttle service that is available almost all day from or to the airport. The rooms are very large and they even have a separate lounge with couches and TV!The night shift staff was really friendly and helpful. The bad thing is that the hotel is far from the centre of Berlin (about 35 mins with S-Bahn), not so suitable forsightseeing. We used it only for a night-over and were very satisfied with both the amenities and the low price!

<Content>Good Hotel for the price Despite the name of this hotel don't expect to walk out of Schonefeld Airport and see it. In reality it is about 1.5 miles away. I made the mistake of trying to find it myself anf that was a big mistake. A travel agent accross the road from the airport had never even heard of it! Ended back up in the airport completely confused! However I quickly realised that the hotel offers a free shuttle bus for the airport. There is a courtesy phone near the Info Desk. Hotel appear to be in the middle of a housing development. That said it was fine, basic but clean. Very handy to railway and by asscoaition central Berlin.
