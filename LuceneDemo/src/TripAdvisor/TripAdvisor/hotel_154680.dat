<Content>Perfect The room was very clean and comfortable. I had read some bad opinions about noisy, but we didn't hear any noise in the room. The hotel is centrally situated.

<Content>Good 3 star for Centro I stayed at Hotel Roble for about 10 days in Dec 07. Overall it麓s a very decent hotel if you want a budget place to stay in Centro. Rates were 275 pesos per night. Staff were friendly  helpful but noone spoke English which might be an issue if your Spanish is weak.They have 2 computers with free Internet in the lobby which was good. I stayed in 2 rooms, one at the back on the lightwell which was a bit dark  old fashioned as another reviewer mentioned. I requested a move to a room overlooking the street. This room was much nicer, better lights  bathroom but there was a lot of noise from the street. If you have never been here you should know that Mexico City is a very noisy place. Car horns blasting, old VW beetle engines revving, traffic cops blowing their whistles. I founfd it difficult to get to sleep at night due to the noise  was always woken early by more noise. In retrospect I would rather have stayed in one of the back rooms.MSW

<Content>Cheap near Zocalo Very inexpensive. We paid only $25 per night.Rooms in the back are dark, on airwells, and unpleasant. But rooms in the front, facing the street are light, airy and very nice. The hotel is remodeling, so all rooms may improve in the future. Good location, two blocks from Zocalo. Good small restaurant on premises, free email in lobby. Said to be an unsafe area at night but didn't feel scary to this single woman. Staff very nice and helpful.

<Content>Convenient and in budget Very conveniently located (2 block from Zocalo, 1 block from metro). The hotel is clean. Rooms are not luxurious, but they are fine for what you pay. Breakfast not included, but there's a cafeteria beside the hotel. The employees are kind. The only complaint refers to some noisy guests, but that's not the hotel fault.
