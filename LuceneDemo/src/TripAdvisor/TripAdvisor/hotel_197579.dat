<Content>An OK hotel if your expectations are not too high I stayed at this hotel for a spur of the moment trip that I took when I unexpectedly had some time off work. I am a single female who had always wanted to visit Paris. I found this hotel by booking an air+hotel trip through Expedia. The hotel was OK for my purposes as I just needed a place to shower and sleep because I was out seeing the city from early until late every day. This hotel was adequate for that. The rooms are, of course, quite small, but that is standard for Paris and must be expected. Although I specifically requested a non-smoking room and was told my room was non-smoking, it had a strong cigarette smoke smell (as did the lobby and elevators). Fortunately, because the room was so warm (I could never get the temperature to drop below what I thought was way too warm--but then I found most indoor places to be too warm--apparently, Parisians turn the heat up high when the weather is cold), I left the window open much of the time to air the room out. And, I liberally sprayed with Febreze that I had packed just in case of smoke issues. Breakfast was included and was nice for someone like me who is only interested in fruit , a nice pastry, some juice and hot tea. I did notice that cereal, yogurt and boiled eggs were also available, as was coffee and hot chocolate. The front desk staff was civil but not overly friendly or helpful. There is a Metro station within about a block (just around the corner), so getting around the city is easy from the hotel. You can easily walk to the big department stores if you are so inclined. And a walk over to the Opera Garnier is a must, to see the inside--especially the Chagall ceiling. There is a bakery across the street and small restaurants nearby. Although it was fine for my first trip, I am visiting Paris again in April this year and will be staying elsewhere.

<Content>Very Good Location I would say the distinct positive about the Hotel is its location a stones throw away from Cadet Metro and other main MetrosJust beware if you are planning to use the parking - Very tight manouvering into the underground parking entrance and the double rooms are tidy but very compactShame about the Breakfast very poor choice based on the amount of rooms

<Content>Great little hotel Five of us stayed at Opera Cadet the last week in March and all of us were very happy with the hotel. We occupied 3 rooms and, while they were all different in size, they were all clean and comfortable. The breakfast was fresh and a good start to our days in Paris. The hotel is located on a narrow street that gave us a glimpse of Paris life with several different small shops. The metro station as within one-half block and the desk personnel were very helpful in guiding us around the city to both the many sites to see in Paris and restaurants in the area. Most of us had never been to Paris before, but I would recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Can't rate this hotel high enough Booked one twin room and one triple room in this hotel through Hotels.com. Was a bit anxious because it was quite inexpensive (拢41 per person bed and breakfast) We had rooms on the 2nd floor which were spacious, clean and modern. (been refurbished not too long ago). The hotel is in the Opera District and about two minutes walk to the nearest Metro. Breakfast was served in the lovely conservatory and was more than substantial. Cerials, eggs, cheese, jams and of course the delicious french bread. There is a great little French restaurant across the road and down to the left a few hundred yards can't remember the full name but something Marche. Not much to look at but the food was excellent. I hope to visit Paris again and will definately stay at this hotel.

<Content>Great Central and Value hotel What a great little hotel in a central location! Went on a bargain deal with two small children, on checkin you are provided with a map and nearby restaurant recommendations which turned out to be great. Found the lobby area quite smart and comfortable for visiting friends, a handy conservatory at the back so we were able to have full use of for our and our friends kids to play late while we stayed up at the bar. Buffet breakfast was very good quality food with a lot of variety and very fresh. Staff were helpful and even during busy breakfast time were able to ensure that you got a suitable table and the right hot drink . Room was clean and quite well equipped with major Euro and US channels e.g. BBC1 for Brits and even a Chinese channel along with Minibar, Safe, Aircon. Only only downside is that the rooms are small or cramped but no great issue given how good everything else was. Will use again.

<Content>Great location, great hotel Excellent three star hotel, very conveniently situated to explore Paris shops and tourist attractions. It is 10 mins walk to Galeries Lafayette and the shopping area and metro station there. There are two other metro stops within 10 mins walk of the hotel itself so access to and from the rest of city is very good. There are a good choice of restaurants nearby. Rue Cadet itself has a number of cafes and shops to buy fruit, snacks etc. so all tastes and budgets can be catered for. Hotel has list of local restaurants, usual tourist advertisements and maps. Check these out on arrival as we only saw Galleries Lafayette discount card too late.Hotel itself is very clean and buffet breakfast was all that was required - choice of cereal, range of juices, fruit, croissants and other breads. Staff were excellent - very friendly and helpful - they had some good advice on local restaurants and also on tourist attractions and metro. Well worth discussing plans with them and best routes to take. We had intended visiting Sacre-Coeur and Montmartre in the evening for sunset on the hill etc. This was not recommended on safety grounds, with kids, and so we amended our plans and visited that area on a Sunday afternoon instead.Rooms were for set up for two or three person occupancy but they also have a number of two bed suites on the sixth floor which sleep four. As a family of 5 (children aged 9, 10  13) I asked if these suites could accommadate five. They arranged to put an additional bed into the kids room for us. Rooms were large, two TVs, mini bar, Shower room and separate toilet, storage room which was almost like an additonal bedroom, sixth floor, aircon, some minimal street noise but not intrusive, two elevators. living space - what more could you ask for!! Price also worked out cheaper than taking separate double and triple rooms.Overall I would stay there again and would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel for unexperienced travelers My husband and I took a trip to London and Paris in the summer of 2006. We started in London and booked to stay at a Comfort Inn in Kensington. It was absolutely terrible. We were hoping that our bad luck would not transfer with us when we got to Paris. To our surprise we found a really great hotel. I will say, it is not in the hustle and bustle of the city, but is so close that it takes only minutes on the metro. The hotel itself is very modern and extremely clean. We loved the room we were in. The ammenities far exceeded what we got in London. The staff was especially friendly, helping us with the language, directions, money exchange and anything else we needed. They even got us a cab to bring us to the airport and bargained a fair ride for us. If we go back to Paris, which I want to do, I know where I'm staying; the Opera Cadet Hotel.

<Content>Well managed  Only spent 1 night at this quietly located but centrally situated hotel, but will definitely return.Either a short bus ride or 3-4 metro stops from eith Opera or Gare du Nord makes this a handy place from which to be based. In a quiet side street with plenty of local amenities and only 50 yds from bus or metro stops makes this hotel one of the best for getting around the city.The reception we had was friendly and informative, the cleanliness couldn't be faulted and the room we were given (floor 6) was air-conditioned - very welcome after a long and hot day spent exploring Paris on foot or by metro.Yes, the bathrooms are on the small side, but most are in Paris/France generally so no criticism there, shower and bath gel in abundance and decent size towels.Continental breakfast was very good, with choice of hot drinks, cereals, juices, fresh fruit, yoghurts, cheese, jam, honey as well as croissants, pain au chocolat and pain aux raisins. If you enjoy a cigarette with your breakfast, then some tables are laid up in the lovely patio garden too.All in all a hotel we shall return to in future.

<Content>A Great Little Parisienne Hotel There are so many hotels in Paris from which to choose that we had to carry out extensive research before booking. We decided on the Hotel Opera Cadet which is close to the Cadet Metro Station and a 15 minute walk from Gare de Nord (where the Eurostar arrives). It is in a quiet street.The hotel is in the mid range but is spotlessly clean, has well appointed, comfortable rooms and a really friendly, helpful staff. There are good restaurants nearby and the Consierge was good to advise on suitable eating places to meet our particular requirements.We were especially grateful to Helene who assisted us so much with our booking for a party of 10 adults, both prior to our arrival and during our stay.The hotel website offers a 360 degree visual tour.We intend to stay there again on our next visit to the French capital.

<Content>suitable hotel My wife and I along with our 2 teenagers stayed at the Opera Cadet for 3 nights the first week of June '08. We paid $300 for a quad room that was set up thru a travel agent as part of a package. The room was very small, as are most rooms in Europe, but was adequate considering we were not in the room most of the time. The room consisted of one double bed along with two singles. The breakfast included your standard European fare such as breads, hard boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt,juices, and coffee. The location was on a narrow street with many shops including patisseries, small grocery stores, and restaurants. The Cadet subway stop was conveniently located across the street. The front desk was helpful for the most part when asked for information. Internet access was available in the lobby for 10 Euros an hour, but we found an Internet Cafe for 4 Euros an hour. The only negative was the dirty carpet outside the room needed cleaning and the hallways smelled musty. Iwould consider staying at the Opera Cadet again.

<Content>great stay for families! We just returned from our trip to Paris. My husband, two teenage children and myself stayed at the Opera Cadet Hotel. The room that we got was a quadruple room and turned out to be a large suite. We had one King size bedroom and another bedroom with two twin beds. The hotel was very clean and the location was great. It is on a nice, quiet street. The hotel Opera Cadet exceeded all expectations. Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! In May 2008 I stayed in the Opera Cadet with my family to celebrate my husbands 50th Birthday. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The hotel was excellent. I am sure this should have been more than a 2 star rating. The cleanliness of the hotel was excellent, beds clean and comfortable. Maid service everyday. The continental breakfast was lovely, overlooking a tranquil garden, the real feel of Paris. Hotel set in a lovely pedestrianised street, with shops and fruit barrows. The staff were very friendly, especially the chap behind the bar. Great location for travelling to all the sights of Paris. Either by the metro or bus. Only problem was finding English food in Paris, had to be fast food restaurants or the french cuisine , which did not appeal to us. Overall we really enjoyed our visit and would thoroughly recommend it, can't wait to go again!

<Content>Don't get a triple room We have just returned from a wonderful stay in Paris. Our first 3 days were spent at the Hotel Opera Cadet. It is situated in a lovely, lively area of the city and very convenient to a Metro stop.My only complaint was that our triple room was on the street side(very noisy) and it was tiny. The room was also very musty smelling...it rained every day which I'm sure didn't help the smell.The good points: the area and the friendly front desk staff ! If you book a room request one away from the street .

<Content>Very good hotel in Paris It's the 6th time I've been to Paris, the 5 th hotel I've stayed in - the best so far.First times I've been to Paris I was student, stayed on Rivoli for 40EUR/room (those days) - very small, the kind of hotel you sleep with with your own towel on the pillow.Opera Cadet has several good points:- Room size: about 11sqm, bathroom about 3-4 sqm which is actually big for Paris.- Location: right where you want to be, next to most of important sites- Cadet street features very nice Oriental restaurant, low prices for Paris (10 eur - one person two courses plus beer)- I've stayed in Opera Cadet for 150EUR/night single room which is a lot (for me) generally, but medium for Paris... I've stayed for 140EUR/night in much smaller room and less cleanDefinitely going back to this hotel.

<Content>Good price, good quality I stayed in this hotel with my husband and my sister last christmas. They have parking so no problem if you have rent a car or travel from another city by car, any way the location is perfect to walk, car is not need it. The hotel is in a pedestrian street with small nice markets and delicius bakeries. The hotel is clean and the staff were very gently. The breakfast was included in the price of the hotel and was delicius fresh bread and a lot of fruit yummi, is not the best breakfast ever but is ok! i will stay there again.

<Content>great location in Paris, ideal to tour around the Capital. My Wife and I had a very nice stay at the Opera Cadet Hotel. From the moment we arrived we knew that it was going to be ideal for our needs. With a 3 day midweek break in Paris and plans to see the majority of the major sights while we were there the opera Cadet catered for all our needs.The breakfast in the morning is mainly a self service of mainly continental fare, but also cereals and fruits are available and the croissant and french bread are a must, try them with some of the jams or honey, bloody marvelous! and the strong coffee will keep you going for most of the day.The staff at the Opera Cadet are most courteous and extremely helpful with tips and advice. we sought to travel around the city, as this was our first time in Paris we wanted to be sure, and the best way to find out is to ask a local! They gave us the easist and fastest ways to get around. Very helpful indeed. there is a tall younger member of reception staff who wears glasses, who's name we didn't get but he was in particular very friendly and helpful.Our room was very adequate and by Paris standards quite large, with the usual ensuite and a 3rd floor view of the street below. Equipped with a mini-bar this I thought was a nice touch but a bit expensive for a beer or a short, the only thing I could mention was the carpet, it was a bit grubby, but I guess mainly caused by guests who used the mini-bar. the bed was firm and comfortable for both of us but has a seriously starched undersheet! took a bit of getting used to but after a days touring and a hearty meal, you will have no problem falling asleep. One last point we were delayed on arrival to Paris and I was to be honest a bit troubled as to whether our room would be held, but there was no problem at all when we arrived.If you are arriving at Charles De Gaulle Airport and are using the Paris Shuttle Mini bus service, they are also excellant, but be aware that the the airport is a bit of a maze the first time, and if you are to be met at exits 16-19 make sure that you go down stairs after you've claimed your baggage. The arrivals floor has the same exit nos. but they lead to Taxi ranks only. You need to go down a floor futher than the Taxi ranks.

<Content>Stayed here for over 10 years. Great hotel I have come to this hotel in March every year for over 10 years and have really grown to love it. As most of the reviews here show, it really is a good value and in a nice neighborhoodThe good points:1) Reasonably sized rooms for Paris - those who complain about the small size of the rooms have not spent much time in Paris. I always go with another person and with a little creative unpacking - things going behind the sofa etc., it is fine2) Very clean. I don't know what a couple people here experienced but I has always had a very clean room in 10 years of staying there.3) Rates that are competitive and on par with other Parisian hotels4) A nice breakfast that can allow you to really save on lunch costs if you eat heartily5) Direct access to a subway station. On the same line as the Louvre or the Parc de La Villette Interactive Science Center. You can be there in Central Paris in 10 minutes, without changing lines. Also multiple buses. What many don't know is that there are also 3 other metro stations within walking distance: Grand Boulevards, Notre Dame de La Lorette and Richelieu-Druot6) A vibrant Parisian neighborhood where you can see actual merchants and actual Parisians in their daily routines, not just people bussed in to work at tourist shops. It is a multi-ethnic neighborhood with many good restaurants, delis and shops, the Folies Bergeres (which until recently hosted Cabaret), theaters, the large area of Montmartre etc.7) Close proximity to supermarkets so you can save money and buy prepared foods, sodas, water etc.8) A lovely caring staff. Helene, Phillipe, Christoph, Jacques and the rest have all been wonderful. They have always been extremely accommodating and wonderful - from fixing a problem in the room (once a technician came like lightening after the safe malfunctioned and my theater tickets were inside) to helping tourists with their questions from the most basic (How do I get to the Eiffel Tower) to the most advanced (What is the best route to get to Malmaison, previous residence of Napoleon's Josephine outside Paris, to questions about flights etc.)While I am obviously a big fan of the hotel, I truly cannot think of any problem or issue that has occurred in a decade which was not solved quickly. The maids can be a little grumpy at times but beyond that, I am really hard pressed to think of bad things to say. While I was not there for the situations that a small number of people complained about I can say that in my experiences over a decade have shown that the quality and service are consistently excellent.Bottom line: As long as you have the right expectations, you'll be fine:1) Rooms are notoriously small in Paris. The room sizes at the Opera Cadet are quite adequate to ones even around the corner2) It is not a brand new hotel in the 1st district but you get good value for your money. If you can endure a 7-10 minute subway ride, you are in the very center of Paris3) If you do encounter any problem, you will be amazed at how helpful the staff is to get the problem resolved quickly. Believe me, I have stayed in many hotels in France and have very often seen the staff which is not helpful.4) With a little planning, you can save a good deal - by going to the supermarket for a few meals or lunch or going for one night or so to the many ethnic restaurants - Indian, Chinese, Japanese in the area. There is also a wonderful deli a few doors down which has a new 8.50 euro menu, entree + dessert. So all in all, a very good value

<Content>Great hotel for Paris By Parisian standards, this was a really excellent hotel and we would definitely go there again. Tripadvisor's American contributors (especially) always seem to complain about the size of the rooms in Paris: no, the rooms at Opera Cadet aren't the size of one of your baseball fields, but for those who want a decent, clean room with a good breakfast in Paris, this would be hard to beat.

<Content>A Good Place to Stay My daughters and I had a most enjoyable stay at this hotel. Our room had three twin beds. That was much better than one double and one twin, which is what we often found available when searching for a hotel. Our room was larger than I expected, and yes, the closet is small--very small. The hair dryer was great. We appreciated the little clothesline that could be strung from one end of the tub to the other. The staff was helpful and friendly. The breakfast room was beautiful, and the breakfasts were the best I've ever experienced in hotels that offer a free breakfast--pots of hot delicious coffee, pastries and other treats as well as the good-for-you fare. We enjoyed trying all the different jams and preserves over the four days we were there. The hotel is right across the street from a wonderful bakery. The Metro is handy. After a day of sightseeing, we usually ate supper around ten at a restaurant near the hotel. The desk clerk can provide a list of nearby restaurants.There is a shuttle that will take you from the hotel to the airport. It was only 16 Euros per person, and worth every penny. We followed the advice of an earlier reviewer and took the train and Metro to the hotel. In searching for the train, we learned how large Charles de Gaulle is...hence the shuttle for the return trip.

<Content>Mixed bag My husband and I stayed at the Opera Cadet for five nights in November 2007. We booked the hotel through a travel agent as an airfare/hotel package. We could tell from the photos on the website and Trip Advisor comments that it was not a particularly charming hotel, but we expected it to be comfortable. When we arrived we were told that the reservation was for two twin beds. Oddly, this happened to us before on another trip booked by the same travel agent, so this time I had been sure to specify in advance that we preferred a queen bed. 鈥淨ueen bed requested鈥?was clearly noted on our prepaid hotel voucher and in the email I sent to confirm the room prior to our arrival (to which I received a positive response), so I don鈥檛 know why they said we booked a room with two twin beds. After a pointless argument we were told that a room with a double bed happened to be available. We rode up in the creaky elevator with our bags. The room was tiny with barely enough space to walk around the bed and almost no room for the luggage. The carpet and walls were stained, the armchair was faded and threadbare, and the room reeked of smoke. We tried to turn on the fan to get some air moving, but it did not work, so my husband went downstairs to inquire about it. He was told that they are required by law to turn off the AC in September, that there are non-smoking rooms, but none were available at that time, and that they can鈥檛 keep people from smoking in those rooms so there would be no difference anyway. We kept the window open the whole time we were there. It鈥檚 going to sound like the Princess and the Pea, but the sheets were so rough and scratchy my skin was red after just one night.We seriously considered changing hotels, but we had prepaid and really didn鈥檛 want to go to the trouble, so the second day we asked to upgrade to a larger room, which cost 20 Euros/night and was well worth it. Like the first room, the second had stained carpet, broken fixtures and hardware, and shabby furniture, but it was reasonably clean. There was much more space and by that time I had learned to sleep with as much skin covered as possible. A simple breakfast is included in the price of the room and is surprisingly satisfactory. The staff at the desk did make some effort at being helpful during our stay. When we checked out they told us we had had two drinks from the mini bar, which we denied (we didn鈥檛 even open the mini bar in either room) and they immediately removed the charge.As to the location of the hotel, it is a good walk from major attractions. There is a Metro stop very close to the hotel, but we happened to be there during a transit strike.

<Content>A Good Deal in Central Paris My husband and I have stayed at the Hotel Opera Cadet twice, once in November 2007 and once in November 2006. We had a good experience on both occasions.While the Opera Cadet is not a luxury hotel, it provides clean and reliable lodging in a central Paris location in the 9th arrondisement (not on the Ile de France as captioned on Trip Advisor). The hotel caters to tourists, many of whom hail from the U.S., Spain and the UK.Like many European hotels, the Opera Cadet has small rooms, especially by U.S. standards. But the rooms are clean, the guestroom plumbing is new and well-functioning (far better than at many other European properties), and the breakfasts-- included in the room rate-- are quite good. You'll also have a variety of international newspapers in the lobby, including English-language publications, as well as good television reception-- including English language channels-- in your room. And if the rooms aren't luxury, neither are the rates-- the Opera Cadet offers a fair rate for its rooms. All told, the Opera Cadet is a good value for tourists who want a reliable, well-located Paris establishment.The best thing about the Opera Cadet is its location in a delightful, residential shopping street on the border of Montmartre and the Opera District. You can walk to many of Paris's most notable sites (the Louvre is a walk of less than 30 minutes), and the Metro is nearby. There are also some excellent restaurants in the immediate neighborhood-- try Pre de Cadet for traditional French cuisine, and either El Mauresque or Chez Leon for Moroccan food.Service at the Opera Cadet can vary from solicitous to overly reserved. We've experienced both, depending on the person attending the desk. On balance, we recommend the Opera Cadet highly to the budget-minded traveler looking for a clean, well-located Paris hotel. The Hotel Opera Cadet delivers a reliable product at a fair price in a fine location.

<Content>Superb Location A very pleasant hotel situated a minutes walk from Cadet metro station. It is also handy for those travellers arriving by Eurostar as it is only three stops from Gare Du Nord station. The staff all spoke English and were very helpful. The room was clean and well decorated. The bathroom/toilet was located in the lobby of the room with a further door to the bedroom. There was no restaurant at the hotel but they do serve breakfast there which was very good. The hotel provided me with a list of local restaurants and there are several good ones nearby. I would certainly stay at this hotel again if I returned to Paris.

<Content>Welcoming staff, spotless hotel- good average for Paris Stayed 3 nights September 2007. Not our first choice and chosen on basis Tripadvisor reviews- and it was fine. Rather dated chain-hotel furnishing, but room spacious enough, quiet, spotlessly clean, comfortable. Breakfast good/average; service very good. Cheerful and welcoming staff lifted this hotel above average. Has integral garage- very useful if like us your holiday means you have to take a car to Paris. Ate at Royal Cadet in same street and again it was nothing remarkable, but fine for a standard Paris Menu and evidently used by locals too.

<Content>In a wonderful street The best thing about this hotel is the street it is in. It has a marvellous village-like feel - full of wonderful boulangeries and delicatessens. The Opera Cadet is near a metro which is very helpful for getting around. The rooms were clean and comfortable, a bit small but full of light. The best thing about them is they are incredibly quiet so even a light sleeper is undisturbed. Breakfast was lovely. The staff are very helpful and polite. I didn't have any problem at check-in, but I wasn't there very early in the morning. I spent three days at the hotel and it was a wonderful place to stay and see Paris.

<Content>Liked the Opera Cadet I stayed at the Hotel Opera Cadet in late June-early July for 10 days and had a very good experience. The front desk staff was also the concierge and they were all extremely helpful with every request. The room was clean, comfortable, well equipped, and had plenty of light which is unusual in a hotel room. It was very quiet. There is a door separating the bedroom from the hall, and this filtered out any hall noise. The tub/shower was very high and required climbing to get in and out, so I wouldn鈥檛 recommend to someone elderly or who can鈥檛 physically manage the rather significant climb. They did accommodate a last-minute request to change to two beds when my daughter unexpectedly showed up, however the extra person charge was high - $24/night which did include breakfast, but the breakfast was very basic and we got pretty tired of it quickly. Regarding some previous reviews: Yes, the hair dryer is very weak 鈥?bring your own. There is no longer a charge to use the safe! Yes, there is a charge to use the computer in the lobby-however, you can use the printer that they maintain as much as you want and they supply the paper. The street is charming and has many options for food to bring to your room. The locals shop here. There is a larger grocery store not too far away. If you arrive but your luggage does not as in my case, there is a women鈥檚 lingerie shop next to the hotel with a very good and reasonably priced selection and a very nice woman there to help. Regarding restaurants, the recommended ones were mediocre. We had a very bad experience at Le Pre Cadet. We arrived at 7:00pm, and the restaurant was empty, so we apologized for not having reservations and asked an older gentlemen (the owner I believe) if he might be able to accommodate us. He told us we were lucky he had a cancellation and seated us. He was very nice through the meal until the restaurant got crowded and he moved the diners next to us to a larger table. We were within 10 minutes of leaving at that point. Then he returned to our table and rudely and sternly told my daughter that when you come without a reservation it makes a problem for him. She apologized but was very upset, as was I. Then he put a check on the table next to us. We were not sure it was ours, so we tried to get his attention to ask. When we asked, he flipped (threw) the portfolio rudely onto our table. The diners next to us were also appalled. My daughter left the restaurant to wait outside because she was humiliated and angry. On my way out I tried to talked to him about how upset he made us and explained that we would have understood if he had not wanted to seat us and he should have turned us away if it was going to be a problem. He just kept repeating at length what a problem we caused him. When we returned to the hotel, we explained all this to our concierge, and he made a call to the restaurant. He talked to the owner, and the owner LIED and said it was the waiter who must have done this. I do NOT recommend this restaurant.I DO recommend Le Petit Zinc in the St. Germaine district. WONDERFUL in every way!!! A fabulous meal and a fabulous experience.

<Content>Loved the location Eight friends and I stayed at the Opera Cadet in May, and we all loved the location. On Rue Cadet, the block-long street on which the hotel is located, there are a boulangerie/patisserie, a butcher, a cheese shop, a candy shop, a fish store, a charcuterie, and a couple of small grocers with beautiful fruits and vegetables on display on the sidewalk. It is a half-block to the Cadet metro stop and to a number of bus lines. The neighborhood is mostly residential, but is convenient and within walking distance of many things if you like to walk (which is the best way to see Paris) and, since it is close to public transportation, easy to get almost anywhere conveniently if you don't want to walk. We had wonderful meals at General Lafayette, Au Petit Riche, and Bistrot Papillon right in the neighborhood. It is a short walk to Galeries Lafayette and its amazing food shop.The staff of the hotel was friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was very enjoyable, especially when it was served in the glassed-in atrium.If you arrive in the morning, be prepared to have to wait for your room. You can leave your luggage in the storeroom and take a leisurely walk around the neighborhood while you wait. Keep in mind that you can stop at almost any restaurant, brasserie, bar, bistrot, etc. and order just something to drink at any time of the day, so you can sit and people-watch while you wait for your room.

<Content>Wonderful stay! We just returned from a 4 night trip to Paris. We had a triple room at The Opera Cadet . (Girl's trip while the husbands played Golf). The hotel provided excellent service, clean rooms, a very hospitable atmosphere and a wonderful Continental breakfast included in the booking price. The room was comfortable and well maintained. The closet was tiny, but there were drawers and a desk. The hot water never ran out! Mademoiselle Helene was extremely helpful at the front desk, as well as another gentleman whose name we missed. Everyone spoke English and was quite charming. The location is wonderful, with the Metro station located accross the street, next to Mc Donald's. Upon our arrival in Paris we took the RER at CDG Airport, switched over at Gare du Nord and hopped on the Pink Line to the Cadet stop. It took less than 1 hour! The location of this hotel provides easy access to all Paris attractions and it's within about an 8 minute walk to Galleries Lafayette and Printemps Department Stores. We felt safe at all times. This hotel complimented our wonderful stay in Paris!

<Content>Great location and value for money My finance and I have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Opera Cadet- The Hotel is not at all far from the Gare De Nord train station. On first arrival to any city it can take time to get use to the area but we actually found the hotel on foot with our luggage (on wheels of course!) so that show how manageable it is- with a map! We booked the hotel through needahotel.com and found it great value for money. On arrival we were checked in quite speedily and allocated to our room. The double room we were allocated to was very very small.. the bed looked like a childs bed definitely not suited to two adults. The bathroom was also tiny you couldnt fit two people standing in it.. however the main problem was the noise of birds!!!!..there was some sort of garden to the rear of our room and there was 100's of birds- therefore the noise was very annoying.. needless to say we went straight down to reception and requested another room..the second room allocated to us was perfect (well in terms of value for money that is!) the room was on the 6th floor, number 606 serviced by two lifts. It was like the attic conversion of the hotel as the windows were on the roof if you get my drift...the shower room was very spacey and had a large mirror across the wall of the room and there was a nice hand basin with plenty of comfy clean towels..the toliet was in a seperate room within the room and that also had a hand basin in it.. so i thought that was a nice touch we could both be getting ready at the same time. The bed was so so comfy in fact very hard to pull ourselves out of it in the mornings and the room service was very prompt each morning..the breakfast on offer consisted of a choice of juices- grapefruit or orange and then breads/pastries and the likes of tea and coffee etc.- i think if you went down to the breakfast room there was a slightly better offering i.e cerels, yougharts etc.. anyway back to the room it just goes to show that there are different types of rooms available for the same price in money so dont be afraid to ask if your not happy first time round!! Other points- the people on reception were quite helpful and the location is adjacent to a metro and mcdonalds..the road the hotel is on reminds me of a smaller scale of moore street in dublin with the stall sellers, although much quieter but very nice...now for the services in the hotel.. well as another traveller quoted the hotel bar is not great at all.. it consists of a counter top and a couple of stools in the main entrance to the hotel.. there is no nice tables, comfy chairs etc so dont be expecting much here.... the hotel has a luggage room which was very handy for ourselves as our flight back to dublin wasnt until 9.30pm and we went off to disney for the day, so they were perfectly safe when we came back. Overall most importantly excellent location, well serviced by metro and buses a stone throw from all the sights, excellent room (2nd time round) and great value for money.. would recommend this to people not fussed about luxury and would certainly stay here again.. oh one last thing for the ladies, the hair dryers are crap- bring your own with a european plug!!! i made the mistake of bringing a dryer and not a plug- dooh! Annoymous, Dublin

<Content>Overbooking!!! I made the reservation with Expedia so not a minor internet vacation provider but when we arrived to the Hotel to start our vacation 28th of December 2006, the receptionist informed us that our room was not available because the person who occupied it was extremely ill. I am sure this is a lie, anyway we decide to accept the proposal to go to another Hotel and to have 20euro as refund for each night of stay. I think that Opera Cadet Hotel is doing overbooking and Expedia does not it.So if you want to be sure to stay at the hotel that you choose in Paris I do not think it is a good idea to book the Opera Cadet

<Content>Great location We have just returned home from our stay at the Opera Cadet. We were very pleased with our selection of accomodations. We had a quad room for our family of 4 (two teenagers). The room actually was bigger than I anticipated. The hotel was very clean, and the beds comfortable. We had a toilet separate from the shower and sink, which was very convenient. There was a small closet for hanging clothes as well as shelves. Staff were friendly and there were no issues with communication as they spoke fluent English. The breakfast buffet was included in our package and was a great start to the day.It included a selection of cereals, pastries, croissants, hard boiled eggs, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, juices,and fruit. The Opera Cadet is located on a street with many wonderful cafe options for lunch and dinner - which were also reasonably priced. There was also a general store and several fresh fruit and vegetable stands. We were also located right at a subway stop, which made traveling about the city very easy.The only negative things I can say is that the hairdryer in the room didn't work well and the first two nights we didn't sleep well due to being able to hear a man and woman arguing. We weren't sure if the noise was coming from the street or from another room in the hotel. The last two nights all was quiet and we slept very well. Our room was also a little stuffy two nights and the air conditioning is turned off this time of year and cannot be used. These were all minor inconveniences. The cleanliness of the hotel, the friendliness of the staff, and the location could not have been better.I would recommend this hotel to family/friends and would denitely stay there again if we're fortunate enough to return to Paris in the future.

<Content>clean, comfortable and convenient I stayed here with my husband and (grown-up) daughter for the weekend at the beginning of November. I had seen the mixed reviews and was a little aprehensive, but have to say this inexpensive little hotel fitted the bill exactly.We were given a 4 bedded room, ok, not much room to move around, but large by Paris standards. The bathrom was small, but had both a bath tub and a shower over, and although the shower wasn't marvolous it was adequate. Fresh towels and amenities (shower gel, soap and shampoo) were provided daily.Admittedly there was no hanging space, but there was a wardrobe with shelves and an in-room safe which I think was 鈧?.5 per day.Breakfast was excellent, as well as juice, coffee, croissants etc. there were cereals, compots, yogurts, cheeses and hard-boiled eggs for those who wanted them. The staff at the hotel were professional and friendly, breakfast service was good as was the help from the front desk and the chambermaids. We did not use the bar, so cannot say.The location of the hotel is perfect, in a quiet no-through road with little local shops and stalls, convenient for the metro at the corner and within walking distance of many attractions.I can recommend l'opentour for an orientation of the city, Carte Blanche restaurant near the hotel and the fact that on the 1st Sunday of every month, entrance to most museums is free of charge.I hope this helps those that are debating whether this is the hotel for them or not. This is not a luxury hotel, but in my opinion it is extremely good value, clean, well run and in a safe area. I would be very happy to stay there again.

<Content>Opera Cadet just right! We stayed at the Opera Cadet for a week in early October. Staff friendly and helpful. Nice quiet and comfortable room for 2 at back of hotel but air conditioning did not work, however, did not need it due to moderate weather at time of year. Good but not exceptional breakfast.Metro is close by as are a number of restaurants (ask at reception for list)Hop on, hop off tour bus is good value for two days. Metro easy to navigate although you need a good size map - one we got at hotel was a little small.River trip is a must. We took the lunch trip (pick up at Eiffel Tower) - a little pricey but worth it.Be warned: Paris is expensive but worth every cent!

<Content>Loved it! A great Paris hotel, good value in a good location This is a great hotel. Great breakfast and clean rooms. The staff is helpful and the Cadet Metro stop is just across the street. I had a room that looked out into the garden area. It was small, but it served its purpose. Boutique style hotel, a pleasant stay. It has a nice small lounge and bar, great for a wine or cocktail after a long day walking the streets. To those who were turned away, you missed out. My suggestion next time, use a Travel Agent or book through a trusted source.

<Content>you'll risk be bounced out!!! We're bounced out even called the hotel twice to confirm the bookings the night earlier!! Following previous comment on Jul 10, 2006 it happens quite often.The only difference is the previous travellers got a little champagne as compensation and we just got a free taxi-ride to another hotel.Bear in mind you're obligated to pay one night if you didn't show up the day. That means you must show up at hotel to secure your $$ but it by no mean secures a room for you.I've told them I'll bad-mouth them for their awful services but they made it clear it does no harm.Are you going to prove that they're right?

<Content>Loved Opera Cadet Nice little hotel, rooms were small but adequate, we had booked a single large room for 4 (2 adults and 2 teenage children) on check in they said they couldn't accomodate it but gave us 2 rooms adjacent to eachother for no additional charge. Very nice breakfast with lots to eat and good variety. Excellent location close to subway system. Staff nice and polite. Overall excellent stay.

<Content>Great Little Hotel My wife and I stayed at the Opera Cadet for a week in early September. Our choice was based on the many favorable reviews on Trip Advisor. They were correct. This is a great little hotel. The location is fine. We walked to the Louvre-Tuilleries area, and to Montmartre-Sacre Coeur. We also used the hotel as a base for guided tours around Paris, to Versailles, Giverny, and Chartres. Everyone at the hotel was pleasant and helpful. The rooms are small by American standards, but are clean and comfortable - and air conditioned, which is unusual for Paris. The breakfast was fine. The bartender was great - an African emigre who came to Paris as a young man 20 years ago and has the wonderful ability to make you feel at home in his space.One minor problem was that the room safe for valuables that we rented did not work. After the second time that the front desk person had to open it for us, we asked for our money back. We got a refund promptly with no hassles. On our tours out of Paris, .we talked to other tourists who were not satisfied with their hotels and we were glad we chose the opera Cadet. We highly recommend it.

<Content>Hotel Opera Cadet is a hit ! ! ! ! We just returned from a trip to London and Paris. While in Paris we stayed at the Hotel Opera Cadet for four nights. We booked the trip through a travel agent and used American Airlines vacation services. The hotel was excellent and very clean. I agree with all of the positve things in the other posts and we did not have any negative experiences during our visit. The location was good, although not right in the middle of some of the popular Paris neighborhoods, the location was very convenient. It is right across the street from a Metro station which means you are only minutes from everything you want to do. However, we often just walked to the south to go through neigborhoods while on the way to the Louvre or other sites. The Metro is just like most in other cities, only less expensive. The hotel's staff (especially Chris at the front desk) was friendly, helpful and professional. We had two teenagers with us and because the quad we had booked was taken, they upgraded us to a nice suite. The breakfast was more than adequate, great pastries, fruit, ceral, yogurt, coffee, etc. The dining room staff was pleasant. The front desk staff was always extremely helpful. For instance when I asked for the location of a nearby post office, they simply provided the stamps etc. and mailed them for me. The neighborhood around the hotel was great, lots of little cafes. The street on which the hotel is located had a small store, bakery, and some small shops for quick sandwiches etc. If you are looking for something on a budget, we strongly recommend Hotel Opera Cadet. We would stay there again!!!!

<Content>Highly Recommend this Quiet 3 Star Hotel This will be a brief review.We most recently spent 4 nights at the Opera Cadet during World Cup playoffs in late June. We are a professional couple who has traveled extensively, however this was our first stay in Paris. In a word our stay was Wonderful. Arrived by cab at 10A as we had an overnight flight from the US. Too early to check in so the friendly front desk clerk advised us to store our luggage in their storage room until our room was available. We were told we could have continental breakfast in their courtyard and it was there we felt we'd arrived. Great coffee, juices, croissants and a large selection of baked goods and fruits, yougarts, eggs made us feel aliveOnto why people read these reviews...Pros: Location. On a street where there is only delivery and pedistrian traffic. Street houses several great pastry shops, cheese shop, wine shop, groceries and other little stores. Metro was two minute walk for easy transport. We discovered since cab drivers can't drive to the front door of the hotel, just to give the Metro Cadet as your destination. Spotless modern Room was on the 6th floor overlooking the quiet courtyard. Understand the hotel was renovated and soundproofed a few years earlier. The outstanding benefit of this was the addition of air conditioning. What a huge bonus. Room was on the smallish side, but so are nearly all the rooms we've stayed in while in Eupope. Space is at a premium and we knew we were not staying at the Ritz nor were we paying Ritz prices. Room also had the newer darkening curtains.We came back late our first night to find a bottle of wine and nice fruit basket. I'd mentioned we were celebrating a special occasion at check in. WOW, what a nice touch. Great Bath, not too small. Typical Euro size. Great water pressure and enjoyed the comp high end toiletries offered. Plenty of towels offered.Bed. Double sized and comfy. Not pillow top like most US places. Little harder which is fine by us. Nice bedding.Breakfast room and Courtyard. Beautiful. Very busy as the hotel was fully booked the entire stay. No wait for coffee and staff was quick to service tables and restock food items.Tons of touristy brochures were available in the lobby. Front desk had directions to just about all touisty spots.  Must mention Jack, the bartender. What a jewel. Great personality and told us we couldn't miss the Sacre Coeur in the Monmartre district. It wasn't even on our list and it ended up being a highlight. Had great dinner in that area.Cons: NoneCan't think of anything I'd change there.Overall impression of Paris was you had to look hard to find a bad meal, didn't need to dress like a model to fit in and believe it or not...the French people actually like Americans. Only met two people with an attitude the whole trip.We would stay at the Opera Cadet anytime and would highly recommend it.

<Content>Double Booked !!! We booked a three night stay for the first week of July way back in January 2006 - with Hotelopia. It was to be special - my birthday, and the location was important to our schedule.We arrived to check-in at 10.00am - and were bounced out. A pathetic common explanation was given such as 'computer error', yet they knew were were coming because arrangements were made for an alternative hotel some days before. No attempt was made to contact me and in compensation they gave us a SMALL bottle of champagne, for TWO!People at the alternative hotel claimed that this was not a rare occurence and that if Opera Cadet receive a later but higher price booking they will bounce you out!!

<Content>Opera Cadet during the World Cup We chose Opera Cadet based on reviews. It met all our expectations. Our party was 2 adults + a 15 year old. We stayed 7 nights in June 2006. Small-ish, clean room with excellent maid service. The very nice breakfast was included in the price and a lovely way to start the day, admiring the adjacent gardens. The staff were all professional, helpful and kind. Exiting onto a semi-pedestrian street instead of a busy boulevard was nice. We liked the surrounding community with its conveniences. McDonalds is around the corner - nice for teenagers. Even with metro a half-block away, this is still a fairly busy location, best for folks who can get around easily. Best features are the garden view breakfast areas, neighborhood shops, cleanliness. Good price. The only sight within easy walking distance is the Garnier Opera. You can walk to the Louvre, but it's not close. Because of the price, good breakfast, cute neighborhood, metro closeby, this is a great hotel especially if traveling with 1-2 teenagers. We felt very welcome at the Cafe Julianne down the street during the nightly World Cup matches when the cafe was packed with locals. Great trip.

<Content>Enjoyed staying at the Opera Cadet We have just returned from a long weekend break at the Opera Cadet. The welcome was extremely friendly and the staff were very helpful. The patio garden is a bonus and it's possible to eat breakfast out here. The breakfast buffet offered a good choice. We had no problem in getting a table but when a large number of guests arrived for breakfast at the same time, they had to wait a few minutes for a table. The rooms were extremely clean, albeit slightly small. The air conditioning was effective and easy to control. There is not a lot of storage for clothes but it was sufficient for a weekend. It was close to a metro station. We felt safe walking about at night. We would definitely go back.

<Content>Great location of this hotel My husband and myself spent 5 nights at this hotel. Our overall stay was very pleasant, although, like others have said rather small rooms and very little storage space for 2 people. Air conditioning was very effective (we would have been lost without it as temperatures were hitting 30!!) and breakfast was plentiful. Our only problem was with the in-room safe which would not work after having it attended to on several ocassions. A refund was offered so no problems there, but was a pain not being able to leave anything valuable in the room whilst we were out. Transport to the airport was arranged by the hotel for us, and although this was very useful I would advise anybody else to book it for at least 30 minutes earlier than your planned flight time as our taxi was running about 30 minutes late!!

<Content>Clean, pretty average We stayed for four nights after reading reviews, and seeing how expensive four star hotels in Paris cost..... We payed 160 euros per night, which i feel was a bit pricy for what we got. The room was clean, but particularly small, with very little storage space. The shower wasn't particularly powerful, but there was plenty of hot water. Friendly helpful staff. Good continental breakfast to set us up for the day. Great little bakery over the street in case anyone sleeps in.. Good location close to Opera, we walked around at night and felt safe.

<Content>Stingy, penny pinching hotel - little noisy, customer service is horrible! After reading all these fabulous reviews about Opera Cadet, we decided to book two rooms at this hotel for a 7 night stay in June. When I arrived from an early morning flight, none of the rooms were ready so I put my luggage in their closet for storage. The street that it is on has some wonderful bakeries and fruit stands. It's a 3 minute walk to the subway station, really good access. Upon checking in, I received a double room. The room was decent, I'd give it 2 stars of a standard American hotel. I used to be a platinum member of Marriot, so I know what to look for in hotels. The room was small, but ppl say spacious for Paris standards. There was no alarm clock in the room. If you wanted a iron, you had to go down to the front desk to get one. You'd have to return it back right away, so other ppl could use it. I'd understand if this was a cheap hotel, but it's rated 3 stars! The hair dryer looked like it came from the 70's. My room was facing the street, in the mornings you could hear the noisy traffic. After a few days, I got used to it and was able to sleep through it.So it comes how the hotel is stingy:They charge you $1.50 euro per day to use your in room safe. Give me a break, I've been to Mexico, Asia, and the Carribean all the time, and never once was a charged. My brother came to stay with me midway into the stay, and they wanted me to pay for his breakfast. 12 euro's for a crossant and juice. At first they wanted me to pay supplemental fee's. Talk about trying to get every euro from your customer. I had a double room for 2 ppl (my bro and I). The staff was kinda rude, one staff member said he didn't speak french when I tried talking to him. Excuse me?! I just saw you talking to someone else in French. I'm not fluent, but hey Im trying to speak your language. Oh and if you want to use the computer, it's 10 Euro's for 30 minutes!!! That's 13 dollars for only a half hour! Talk about milking your customers. Very stingy and cheap. Please use that money and buy some irons for every room!Overall the facility and room is decent and clean, but I wouldn't stay here again - based on Customer Service. There are plenty of hotels in Paris, and Im sure they'll appreciate your stay instead of treating you rude and milking you for every dollar.

<Content>Wonderful little jewel of a hotel My wife and I as well as our 2 adult daughters stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while in Paris. The staff was very friendly, the hotel was very clean and the location was great with a subway station 1/2 block away and a bus stop closer than that. The best feature of this hotel is the included continental breakfast. The food selection was great and plentiful. The patio garden was charming and just lovely. The hotel is situated on a semi-pedisteran only side street with a fresh fruit vendor/store across the street. Resturants, with sidewalk seating (which is just so Parisian) are within a block or less. We had dinner at one of these and the food was only ok as were the prices, the atmosphere however, was great. We will stay at this hotel on our next trip to Paris. I highly recommend it.

<Content>Wonderful hospitality! We stayed at the Hotel Opera Cadet for 3 nights in the summer of 2002. Not knowing what to expect on our first trip to Europe, we were very pleased with the great service, friendly, helpful and accommodating staff, good-sized rooms, and a great, safe location. This hotel was able to provide a room suitable for 4 people (my husband, myself, and two teenagers), and a nicely sized one too! With a metro just outside the door, abundance of shops and restaurants within 10 min walking distance, a cute fruit stand and bakery just below our 2nd floor windows, and Gallerie Lafayette blocks away - we were very happy indeed to have stayed there. In fact, we loved it so much that we are going back in late June and have already booked a room at the Hotel Opera Cadet... though rates are quite a bit more expensive this time!

<Content>Great Experience! We chose Opera Cadet because we were a family of 4 and it was the only hotel I could locate in all of Paris that would accommodate 4 in one room. We were totally delighted with the hotel. The room was simple and not large, but very typical of European hotels. The location was great, as you have read in other comments, right near a Metro stop and on an adorable quiet street with many interesting small shops and restaurants. We walked to many interesting spots including Sacre Coeur and the beautiful historic Paris shopping arcades. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Opera Cadet...Hooray! My mother, my friend and myself stayed at the Opera Cadet. The rooms were very comfortable and the staff was wonderful. My mother became sick halfway through and the staff was very helpful and considerate. The rooms were neat and very clean. My mother had a small single room on the street side which can get a bit noisy, but she managed to sleep. As with all European budget hotels your hair will probably dry faster by running around the room than using the hotel hair dryer. A disadvantage when you have long hair and it's the middle of winter. It was nice that smoking was not allowed in the breakfast room. There is a great little restaurant around the corner called Chez Salvatore. It's Italian food, but the owners were very friendly and even gave us free soup for my sick mom. All in all we found the people of Paris to be friendly, the metro awesome and the Opera Cadet a great place to stay.

<Content>A Great Little Hotel I was not expecting anything spectacular when I booked in, as I have previous underwhelming experience of Parisian hotels. However, everything about the Hotel Opera Cadet is geared towards making your visit to Paris memorable and comfortable. It is in a great location, a two-minute walk from the Opera and Galeries Lafayette, with a Metro right outside the door. The staff speak decent English and were very helpful. It's also lovely and quiet, not to mention spotlessly clean. The only minor quibble I would have is the variety of food available at breakfast, but in Paris,you should really get out and sample the produce in the cafes and patisseries anyway. I will definitely be booking this hotel again!!!!

<Content>Great hotel We booked this hotel after much research and the result was very good. Stayed 7 nights. Room on 5th. floor clean and comfortable. Staff all friendly and helpful. My wife and I ate in the room 3nights buying cheeese,pate, coldcuts,wine and fabulous pasteries right on Cadet from the local stores .We lived the life of Parisians. Absolutely not a tourist trap. Everything was nearby be it walking, metro or bus. Breakfast was great . We skipped lunch and would have an expresso around 4. and supper at 8.We suggest the purchase of a Carte Orange and museum pass.The brasseriere at the bottom of Cadet is reasonable and good for an inexpensive meal. It being on the same side of the street as the hotel. Paris was great and the hotel was a safe comfortable place to lay down your head after a busy day sightseeing. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel as a wonderful 3 star hotel.

<Content>Better than average Hotels in Paris I Stayed there 3 nights while on a business trip, but I could imagine coming again with my family on a holiday. Service was okay. Check in and out was quick with no problems. Staff was nice. Room was bigger size than average room in Paris. Only negative side was breakfast which was quite poor. But that's normal in this town. Which I do not understand, since French people are so proud of their food.Location is good. Metro is only a block away, but you can always take a walk. It's a beautiful city and there's only a short walk to major shopping area.All in all. Nice hotel. I would stay again.

<Content>A gem We chose Opera Cadet because the American Airlines vacation package staff loved it and we were delighted with the location and staff. Mme Rifflart, the Chef de Reception was especially gracious. Our stay was the week after Christmas last year (I'm a bit late with this review!) and most of the guests were European so it didn't feel American touristy. We had a triple so there wasn't much extra space, but the bath was just fine. How much time does one spend in the room anyway?The metro stop was quite convenient but don't go in the restaurants near it if you want good food/service. On the other hand, the shops on the Rue Cadet itself were fine. The bakery at the end of the street is better than the one just across from the hotel.My husband still longs for the hotel shampoo...and the breakfasts. He would go back any chance he could.

<Content>Great hotel in an area with character I review  rate hotels for a living  I can say that this hotel is really worth a visit. It's located kitty corner to the Cadet Metro station, on a really cute little street with pastry shops, fruit stands, and a few restaurants. There are twinkly lights strung up over the street which gives it a lot of character. It's a 10 min walk to the Galleries Lafayette and about 25 mins to the Louvre. There are a tonne of restaurants in the area as well as bars. The hotel is nice with modern rooms that include shower  tub. The only negative is that when getting ready to go out at night the water was never more than luke warm  the hairdryer wasn't very strong. The water was always fine in the morning.The rooms at the back of the hotel overlook an interior garden  the rooms at the front overlook the street with the Eiffel Tower in the far background.I originally wanted to stay closer to the Gardens Tuiliers, however after walking around in that area I didn't think it had as much character.If you don't feel like walking, the Cadet Metro station (pink line) will take you south to the Louvre area. You can also easily walk to the Notre-Dame de-Lorette Metro station (green line) which will take you North to Montmartre area.You can take the RER from the airport to Gare du Nord station  then hop on the Metro, but it is usually pretty busy so watch your bags.

<Content>Another wonderful stay We had another wonderful stay at the Opera Cadet. The location is terrific with the Metro station 50 yards away. Rue Cadet is a narrow market street with bakeries, restaurants, shops and lots of pedestrian activity. The hotel is modern with all the amenities. The breakfast room is on the main floor and overlooks the garden. The staff was delightful. We plan to return again.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! We found this hotel on the Trip Advisor web page and are so happy we did.The Hotel was perfect for our first visit to Paris.The hotel is located on a quiet side street which has a Bakery, fruit shop, cheese shop, deli you name it.It was fun shopping with the locals who tried to understand our basic french!The hotel staff were really helpful, especially when it came to answering our questions of how to get to all the famous places. The Hotel Opera Cadet is located within easy walking distance to the popular tourist sites.From Charles de Gaulle airport we caught the train to Gare de Nord station and walked to the hotel from there which took about 10 minutes.We can't wait to go back to Paris and stay there again.

<Content>Terrific place to stay. Now that we are back in Dublin (Ireland) and I have overcome the shock of turning 60 I feel I want to express our gratitude to all at Hotel Opera Cadet for having made our stay in their magnificent city such a pleasure. They even assisted in making growing older an exciting and pleasurable experience .... that takes some talent! From the moment we stepped into the reception area we felt at home and at ease. The staff were all so pleasant and seemed to spare no effort in explaining things and giving great advice. Special mention must be made of our Cameroonian friend behind the bar who actually walked us down to a suitable restaurant on our first night there! The cleanliness and comfort cannot go unmentioned either. We had been told by less fortunate friends that bedrooms in Paris hotels are notoriously small - not so ours.  My big wish is that I don't have to wait until I turn 70 before I get to visit Paris again - and needless to say Hotel Opera Cadet will be like home to us when that happy day arrives!

<Content>Had a great time! We just returned from a week at the Opera Cadet. The airlines mislaid our luggage for 4 days! The front desk staff was so helpful in trying to locate the luggage since we did not speak French. They recommended restaurants that were delightful. We felt the location was ideal,the metro is right there and took us all over the city! They gave us directions for every place we wanted to see. The breakfast was good:bread,cheese,hard boiled eggs,yogurt,fruit,cold cereal,juices,pastries...more than enough to start the day!! the wait staff was friendly and very efficient. And the rooms were very clean. We felt very safe and comfortable there and would love to return!

<Content>Great location, wonderful staff Our family of 5 stayed in 2 rooms for 2 nights at the Opera Cadet, in a double and a triple. Although the rooms (esp the triple) weren't exactly spacious, they were clean and the beds were fairly comfortable. The a/c (important in August) worked well, the showers were nice, and the rooms were quiet. Rue Cadet is in a great classic Parisian location, a few doors down from the Cadet metro stop, and a short walk to Galleries Lafayette, the Hard Rock cafe, and plenty of little streets full of character. Next time, we'll come back sometime other than August (lots of closed shops, incl the boulangerie across the street), but walking was still a lot of fun.The continental breakfast was delicious, the staff were very friendly and helpful, and almost everyone understood at least some English. And if you're like us and travel light, ask them to point you to the great little laundromat about 2 1/2 blocks away, so you don't have to hang underwear in the shower...

<Content>An Excellent Hotel Our family (two adults, a 16yo and an 11yo) booked this hotel based on other TripAdvisor reviews and we made the right decision. Finding a good hotel in Paris that can fit 4 people to a room is quite challenging.First, the location. The hotel is on a quiet side-street just off one of the busy avenues in the 9th arrondisement, near Gallerie Lafayette and the Opera. Our room faced the street and noise was not a big issue for us, seasoned city dwellers, although there was some construction being done a few doors up the street. Also, the hotel is steps from the Metro Cadet station which gives access to the wonderful Paris underground transportation. We walked from the hotel to see Paris Story on the day we arrived and it took about 10min.Second, the rooms. The room we were in was small but it fit the 4 beds, was very clean and everything worked. Air conditioning is a treat on hot days. The pillows are quite thin but you can ask for more of them. It was a luxury to have a bath/shower combination - especially for soaking tired feet after a full day walking on cobblestones.Third, the staff. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and very helpful. They gave good directions, provided maps and, in our case, gave excellent advice on how to find a medical clinic and what to expect. Finally, the other niceties. The staff provided extra shampoo/soap and towels. The internet worked well although it was pretty pricey (E20 for 3hr) - that's typical in Europe unless you go to an Internet Cafe. Breakfast was fresh, plentiful and (a complete shocker for the price) included hard-boiled eggs. We saw the staff carrying the baguettes from the bakery across the street so we know the source - and we bought one for ourselves just before we checked out.E179 per night for the 4 of us, including breakfast and all taxes.(Pictures from other reviews and websites are well-indicative of the hotel and location.)

<Content>Fantastic staff! My friend and I booked the Opera Cadet through American Airlines Vacation. The woman with AA had stayed there and recommended it. It is a small hotel that is walking distance to many places. It is located on a quaint, typical Parisian side street. We had fresh croissants every morning from the bakery across the street! The continental breakfast was wonderful!The Metro is at the end of the street. The rooms are what you'd expect in an European hotel. The staff is exceptional!! They were tremendously helpful and kind to us during our stay. They gave us wonderful directions to everything. They had suggestions that proved invaluable. Since I've returned home, I've written them and they have been more than generous in their responses. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Paris. J.D., Illinois

<Content>Great ambience, great staff, lovely street We just returned from Opera Cadet after a 5 night stay. Great location, on a lovely mostly pedestrian street (if you want to experience a slice of French life...with non touristy shops, this is the place to stay). The rooms are nice, clean, clean bathrooms, refrig. in room. The staff is very friendly, the person at the desk at night was one of the friendliest and service oriented hotel employees I have dealt with (and I have stayed at 5 star hotels also). The metro is walking distance....loved the neighborhood, and wish we could have spent more time in this neighborhood (but we had so many other sights to see). There are great cafes down the block, great boulangerie across and authentic shops around. The Opera Garnier is walking distance as well down the Rue Lafayette. Great metro access also. I would gladly return to this hotel any day.

<Content>loved it - great value Stayed here in april and I found the staff were always really helpful, friendly, chatty. Having to book a single room as I was travelling alone, I expected a tiny cramped room as this is what you normally get in European hotels and I was astounded when I realised I had been given a much larger room (it could sleep three), the bathroom, as per the previous reviews, was quite large and immaculately clean. All in all I was really surprised by the quality of this hotel, the bar was fine, there was a great selection of breakfasts even for people like me who are the last ones into the breakfast room every morning, the staff were so friendly, I normally stay in 4star hotels when I travel on my own, to ensure a safe, comfortable environment, however the Opera Cadet was a unique 3 star experience, if you intend travelling to Paris soon and want a clean hotel, with decent service and for a much lower price than 4stars, I would definitely recommend this hotel. In addition to this the restaraunts in the vicinity are really great value, allowing you to stay close enough to your hotel for your meal, always important after a hectic day's work or sightseeing !!!!

<Content>opera cadet hotel For the price, the Opera Cadet was a good choice. Good location, very close to Cadet Metro station, short walk to Galeries Lafayette department store. Rooms small but adequate. Great front desk staff. Breakfast OK but exclusively carbs. Hot water not reliable. Showers went from cold to warm to cold in moments. Hairdryers very slow...Had to leave windows open to cool off room (late Mar./early April). Beautiful garden but be warned...huge bird gathering every morning around 5:00 AM...unbelievable racket, particularly with open window. Nice small shops and cafes all around..easy to eat economically in this area. Loved small Italian restaurant name Salvatores. Also good small Greek sandwich shop on Rue Cadet, a few doors down from hotel with good prices. It is not a 4 or 5 star hotel but good value for the money. Be forewarned, if you are short in stature the tub/shower can be challenging. It sits VERY high off the floor and can be difficult to get into (and I am fairly tall for a woman). Seems to be the norm in Europe as had same experience in our London hotel.

<Content>Great stay! We (a group of friends from the Chicago area in the U.S.) recently stayed at the Opera Cadet, and we were very satisfied with the hotel and their employees. We especially were pleased with the help that Mike offered. In addition to tour advice, he was pleasant and cheerful whenever we saw him. We'll definitely stay at this hotel again--hope that will come soon and the stay will be longer.

<Content>Loved it Great 3 star hotel for Europe. Very intimate. Large bathrooms with shower. Elevator building. Very close to metro stop and easy access to anywhere in Paris. This hotel suited our needs since we only used it as a place to crash and change clothes before going back out. If you want a room that is inviting to hang out in, then this is not the place for you. Not much to offer for TV or sitting room other than the twin beds. Did have a nice bar and breakfast was a great way to start the day. Cold buffet. The lobby is welcoming. The staff very friendly and answered all of my questions. I would stay here again.

<Content>Opera Cadet a mixed bas I stayed at the Opera Cadet in March 2005 and have mixed reviews. The location is great, right by the Metro stop and in a pleasant neighborhood. The Hotel was booked through AA vacations and was fairly pricey for what we received. The staff is multilingual but not terribly friendly or helpful. After having my wallet stolen on the Metro, I got advice from the desk to call a 鈥渓ocal鈥?phone number to cancel my credit card. This worked well, however, when I checked out I found out that the number I was given was a 鈥渟pecial鈥?number and I was charged ~1 euro / minute for the call to cancel my credit card. This came to a total of 23 euros. I felt that I was ripped off twice, once by the thief and the second time by the Hotel.

<Content>Great location You couldn't find a better location for shopping, sightseeing, metro etc... My mother and I stayed at the Opera Cadet last weekend (10-13th March). The hotel was so well situated we walked from where our airbus dropped us off in the centre of Paris @ la fayette galleries. It took us approximately 10 mins. We were greeted by a smiling receptionist when we approached the desk. The room was not as small as we thought, it was clean, had all the ammenities including a mini-bar. It even had a cork screw which came in handy. The bathroom has a hair dryer but it's not very powerful. Soap, shower/bath gel and shampoo are all there. The shower is quite powerful, but the bath is small and quite high. It could be a problem for elderly guests or guests who suffer bad backs. There was room service everyday (even Sunday). We also found that it was quiet (or maybe that's because we were so exhausted after our day of shopping and sightseeing that once we hit the pillows we were out like a light). You can check the weather forecast chart in the lift as you go down for breakfast each morning. The breakfast is continental ie. croisants boiled eggs cereal youghurt juices. Waiting staff were helpful. After breakfast you can avail of the complimentary newspapers and sit out in the conservatory with an expresso or a cup of tea. I have no reservations in recommending this hotel. We had a lovely stay and intend to come back for a return visit very soon. PS. When leaving for the airport be sure to order a shuttle (鈧?5 per person)as we made the mistake in ordering a cab to our cost.

<Content>Nice family hotel I really liked this hotel. It was difficult finding a hotel a short notice that would accomdate a family of four for a reasonable rate. Breakfast was included but we didn't find this out until our second day. It was in a convient locationwe walked with our child and bags from the gare du nord to the hotel which took about 20mins. Rooms we nicely decorated and clean.We would stay there again. Good value for money in Paris

<Content>A Gem in Paris Thanks to all of you who take the time to write reviews, I recently spent a week at this lovely little hotel based on your recommendations. The location is superb- just across the street from the Metro, and on a short block chucked full of typical local shops including bakeries, cheese stores, wine shop, convenience store, etc. We were concerned about going from a 5 star hotel on our last trip to a 3 star hotel on this trip, but couldn't pass up the great deal. We were not disappointed. The front desk staff is amazing. They will help you with anything and do it in a friendly way-- more accommodating than the staff at the Grand Hotel on our last visit to Paris. The rooms are small, clean and adequate. We were in room 516 that had three twin beds, so the room was a bit larger and was nice for the two of us. It was kept tidy and we had clean linens and towels daily. We always bring our own soap and wash clothes when in Europe and recommend this at the Opera Cadet. The soap is the size of a quarter and there are no wash clothes. There is nice bath/shower gel and shampoo. There is one 110 shaver plug in the bathroom. If you use a hair dryer, you will want to bring your own with the appropriate adapter/plug. The hair dryer on the wall wouldn't dry a bald man's head! We were pleased to find a mini-bar and used it to keep our stash of soft drinks, water, pastries, etc. (small amounts!). The continental breakfast buffet is typical with juice, yogurt, breads, cereals, and hard boiled eggs. The wait staff who brings coffee and tea is friendly and warm. I will definitely stay here again when I am back in Paris.

<Content>Great location! Went to paris for a week with a girlfriend and did extensive study on where and what to do. I believe we did it all, even the underground tunnels in the city with the miles of buried bones. Stayed at Opera Cadet and it was just lovely. Right in the center of town with the wonderful shops and baking bread etc. The famous shops are within walking distance and right up from the subway. We felt safe at all times though did see one altercation from the subway but nothing like New York! The louve is wonderful but try to get your passes before you leave the states or from a front desk- the lines are awful. With a pass you stride right by. The rumor of rude French people was not confirmed by us at all- if you pull out a map people stop and tell you where to to. Fantastic pastries! Try them all! You can take a subway everywhere- we never got a cab and saw all the famous sites and had dinner on the riverfront by Notre Dame. Wonderful time!

<Content>Wonderful hotel ! This hotel is the most pleasing and welcoming 3 star that I have seen in Paris and I have travelled there forever. The staff is wonderful and caring as well as very helpful. The rooms are comfortable and very clean. What I enjoyed the most is the hotel's atmosphere with it's big veranda where you can relax and enjoy a drink and the beautiful garden with a fountain for sunny days. The hotel also has the advantage of being in the centre of Paris near the Opera, a lively yet secure quartier. I recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to spend a lovely time in Paris.

<Content>Skip the Opera I have been to Paris many times and speak the language as it happens to be my first language thus the problem I encounter were not cultural.The Opera Cadet is not well located, as stated on its website. Sure, there's a metro a few feet away but there are also food markets next door which is not ideal at all since it brings noise and smells.The staff was nice. However, the walls are sothin that I could actually hear the neighbor's electric shaver and could smell the cigarette smoke from next door. Forget the free breakfast, it's worthless. At least, the hotel does have an airport shuttle at reasonable price. The rooms were clean but not spotless. You will find only 3 english speaking TV channels. I'm 30 and trust me when I say that the Opera Cadet and its neighborhood is not where the action is.

<Content>Nice hotel, not very expensive Just returned 1/5/05 from a 5 nite stay @ this hotel. Front desk staff was very friendly  helpful, especially Chris; all spoke good English. Location very close to Metro, on a really cute street--lots of specialty shops. Altho had requested a non-smoking room, was told on arrival one was not available. Staff had heavily sprayed some kind of deodorizer heavily in room, so room was OK--I did not notice any lingering smoke smell  didn't notice the deodorizer smell after a few minutes. Room was very clean. Hair dryers in room were slow as reported in other posts on this site, but adequate (since we burned out our 110 model even tho we used our converter).

<Content>Pleasant hotel I am intrigued by the various opinions of this hotel. All the earlier posts had high praises for this hotel then slowly, the reviews became very mixed. I was initially worried as I had actually booked the hotel for the 12 to 22 of December before the bad reviews came out but I decided to stick to my decision and just try it out. I am very glad that I did. It is a very pleasant hotel. Low on in-house amenities (it is a small hotel) but high in almost everything else. Firstly, the service at the concierge/recepiton was nice enough and there was one guy who got really chummy with us since we stayed at the hotel for some time. It has a superb location near the Cadet metro station which would be the starting point for all your Paris explorations. There are quite a few bistros around with hearty food. My sis and I ate mostly at the Monte Carlo which was a few steps down from the hotel. The staff there were extremely entertaining. There is also a wonderful patisserie right in front of the hotel, La Maison Dupuy where I bought my daily eclairs. The hotel's breakfast is more than adequate with nice wait staff. The rooms are not huge, but they certainly were not tiny. My sis and I had ample space to move about and we didn't even have to squabble over luggage area. The bathrooms were good and yes, the water pressure is EXCELLENT! The maid certainly did clean up more than just the sheets and she was very friendly too. The only bad thing I have to say about this hotel is that the pillows are horrendously thin. All 4 of them won't make up for one of my own at home. Other than the pillows, if you are looking for a reasonable hotel (stop thinking Ritz or George V) to use as a base to explore Paris, you won't go too wrong in picking the Opera Cadet :)

<Content>Paris Perfect My husband and daughter and I just returned from a week at the Opera Cadet Hotel. The staff was wonderful, as was the service. This is a modest hotel, but prefect for our stay since we were in Paris to tour the city. We would stay here again on a return visit to Paris.

<Content>Quite disappointed My daughter  I stayed at the Opera Cadet 12/21-28 with a package through American Airlines. Yes, the location was great, the street itself very Parisian and the staff was nice and helpful. However, our room was just too small and claustrophobic to accomodate two people. We had less than two feet of walking space around the beds. The carpet was stained, the beds  pillows extremely uncomfortable and the maid chose to make the beds and change towels daily, but nothing else. I think the room would be okay if it were for a single traveler, but I would not stay at the Opera Cadet again. Other reviewers mentioned a fruit basket and wine; we did not receive a welcome gift. From the information on OC web page I thought there was a coin laundry but the only laundry available is through the hotel and was extremely expensive. This was my second trip to Paris and on the first trip I stayed at the Hotel California and was delighted with my experience there. This trip was part of my first daughter's senior year present and in four years when my second daughter's senior year rolls around, we definitely won't be staying at the Opera Cadet.

<Content>Great place to stay in Paris It's not a high class luxury hotel. But if you who are taking a trip to Paris to see the city and need a nice, comfortable, affordable place to sleep then the Opera Cadet is the place. My wife and I went for 3 nights in late November and enjoyed every minute of it. We owe a lot of credit to tripadvisor.com and the users because I read a lot of good reviews here before I booked our room. Just returning the favor now. Location is great for traveling on the metro. Station is right across the street and very convenient. Location is also great because there are a ton of little shops and restaurants that line streets around the hotel. Be careful about what restaurants you eat at though. There are some very good one's around there but also some very bad one's. Good rule of thumb....Don't go into a restaurant if a waiter comes out while you are reading the menu and tries to lure you in. It might seem like a bargain, but your stomach will pay for it. Definitely try to research restaurants on the internet before you go because it's hard to tell good from bad when you are there. The breakfast every morning is really nice! Nothing really heavy to fill you up, but all the crossiants, bagets, and other pastries you can eat. Also have yogurt, jam, cereal, coffee, juice, hot chocolate. Also have a half dozen different newspapers that you can help yourself to and take.The service there was very good. Front desk speaks English very well and waitresses during breakfast are friendly.The rooms are small like most Paris hotels, but we didn't have a problem with it because the only time we used our room was to sleep and shower. The bathroom in our room was normal size and had awesome water pressure. Good closet storage space for clothes and optional safe for a fee if you need it. I booked my trip, plane, transfer, and Opera Cadet stay at American Airlines website (--------). Getting a package deal like I did saved me a lot and even got a free bottle of wine and basket of fruit upon my arrival.Hope all of you find this as helpful.

<Content>Cozy, Confy  I stayed at this hotel for a week while my stay in Paris. I couldnt have asked for more, the hotel has an excellent location, about 10 steps away from the Opera Metro Station, and is right on a street market full of life in the morning with the locals, and very close to pubs and restaurants and money exchange places. The rooms are very modern, cozy and they actually gave us a bowl of fruit and a bottle of wine the first night!!!. the people were very helpful with directions and over all i had a great experience and will definitely book there again on my next trip.

<Content>Not as good as before Spent three nights at the Opera Cadet two weeks ago. I usually enjoy this small hotel but this time there seemed to be a change in attitude. Requested a no-smoking room and the first room they gave us made my eyes water - the smoke was still in the air. The front dest clerk was not happy he had to change our room. Also, I requested an extra pillow and was told they had no extra pillows. Breakfast was good. I hope this hotel reverts back to the way they used to be.

<Content>Good value in Paris We stayed at this hotel Nov. 25 - 28 through an American Airlines vacation. (A very generous package rate of less than $150 a night!)The hotel is on a little cozy street with open markets, about a 15-20 minute walk to the Louvre, Opera Garnier and Montemarte. Of course there's a Metro stop about half a block away, that lets you get anywhere in the city in minutes. Very convenient.The neighborhood is very clean and safe and has many cafes, restaurants, pharmacies and shops -- pretty much anything a traveler needs. We found the hotel very accomodating and helpful. The front-desk staff all spoke decent English and answered our few questions. A breakfast of croissants, hard-boiled eggs, baguettes and jam, cereal, coffee and juice is included in the rate and is served every morning from 7 - 10:30. We missed it one morning, and the manager on duty served us food at the bar. We were impressed! The room was clean and efficient, but nothing to write home about. However, I hear that's par for the course in Europe. There was very little decoration and just a small TV. The bedspread and carpeting looked quite outdated and a little dingy. The bathroom was equally small and included a cramped tub and shower. There was a very low-power hairdryer. If you're looking for an extra-comfortable or luxurious hotel room, this is not the place. The rest of the hotel was much nicer.All the same, it served our needs just fine. We rented the safe in our room for 1.50 euros a day + a $10 deposit.One quibble: The night manager scolded us one evening upon return for not turning in our room key before we left for the day. We didn't want to do this and we didn't. Nobody else at the hotel every mentioned this was the hotel's policy!

<Content>A good buy, clean, well located, nice friendly staff Reading some of the negative reviews made me wonder if the writers were very rich (and could afford to stay on the Champs Elysees in the past??) or had never been to Paris before. ALL Paris hotel rooms are tiny. Hotel Opera Cadet rooms were adequate, clean, quiet, comfortable. Bathroom was small (as all Paris hotel bathrooms are) so don't treat this as a negative. The bathroom was very clean. Location is excellent. Just steps from Metro and located on a pedestrian street. There are restaurants all around the area. It is within walking distance of many sites but you must learn to use the Metro to see Paris. Breakfast was very good. Staff very friendly, English speaking and always helpful. I recommend Opera Cadet. It is a good buy for the money.

<Content>Opera Cadet was okay but not outstanding. We stayed at the Opera Cadet for four nights from October 7-11, 2004. The hotel, itself, was okay. Not outstanding, but not awful either. Room size was not large, but adequate. Bathroom was small, and hair dryer was poor. Breakfast was great: croissants, yogurt, cereals, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, etc. What we didn't like was the location. Yes, it was close to the metro, but everywhere we went required a metro trip. It really wasn't close enough to walk to any of the main Paris attractions. We didn't find that there were a lot of restaurants around--really only found one brasserie, and that was just okay. The awning outside the restaurant said that it was a creperie, but they didn't have any crepes. My guess is that it used to be a creperie, and possibly it's changed hands, but new owners didn't change sign. It was okay, but if I went to Paris again, I'd probably stay closer to the main sights.

<Content>Great Value, Great Location My wife stayed here from 9/26-10/3. We were very happy with the place. It is incredibly convenient to the metro and many nice neighborhood restaurants. It is also well within walking distance to Monmarte and Sacre Couer church.Our room was very clean and had a double and two twin beds. It wasn't large, but very few rooms in Paris are large. (Although the last time I was in Paris on business I stayed in a suite at the George V that could seat 18 people without anyone sitting on the bed! Of course the room rate was a little higher than the Opera Cadet.) Our room overlooked the street which was a little noisy despite the double pane windows. There was absolutely no room to room noise and a room off the back would have solved the street noise problem.The breakfast facility was very nice and the breakfast was simple, but more than adequate. The courtyard in the back was quite tranquil and it we enjoyed drinking a glass of wine out there in late afternoon. The desk staff was also very helpful.I concur with the poster that the hair dryer was very slow. We walked in the neighborhood and bought our own for 18 euros. Overall, I think this was a very good value for the money and I highly recommend it despite some of the negative reviews.

<Content>So, so We have just returned from Paris where we stayed at this hotel for three nights. We chose it for the great reviews we read. The bad ones unfortunately only appeared after we booked.The good things first: Location is very good, the breakfast is ok, the rooms are clean.However, the rooms are really tiny and so are the beds and the bathroom. We were supplied with thin blankets (No duvets) and we were cold in the night. The rooms are supplied with safes, however they need to be rented separately. Ours did not work properly throughout the stay to which the porter (visibly annoyed) commented that I was not able to use it. When I told him I followed the instructions, he only said that I should ignore them and showed me his way. In any case, it made no difference.

<Content>Great hotel We just returned from three weeks in Europe that started with a four night stay at the Opera Cadet. We found it to be one of the best hotels of our European stay. Our room was quiet, clean and provided one of the best morning breakfasts. It was the only hotel that provided fresh fruit which we enjoyed. The hotel staff was very helpful. The metro was conveniently located across the street and we shopped for sandwich food right on the rue Cadet. The only disadvantage was that all the sights were a distance from the hotel. We had picked this hotel for the rave reviews and its walkable distance to Gare du l'est, the East train station. That was wonderfully convenient as we continued onto Switzerland.

<Content>so so... depends on your deal I stayed at the Opera Cadet last year with my mom on a weekend trip to Paris whilst I was still living in London. The location has easy access to a metro once you find it- it's a little difficult to locate at first. The non-smoking rooms were rank of very bad smelling (I honestly have a high tolerance for smells- this was bad) room spray and smoke. We had to ask them not to spray the rooms anymore during our stay. You might just be better off requesting a non-smoking room. The breakfast was decent- nothing super special for paris, but there were two patisseries right accross the street that definitely had them beat. If everything else was booked, this place is tolerable and not too bad. The staff was incredibly friendly compared to most. However, I would recommend looking elsewhere first if given the opportunity.

<Content>Clean room My family and I usually stay in a well known chain hotel in the States so I was a little skeptical as to the quality of this hotel despite all the good reviews I read online. The cleanliness of the room is of utmost importance to me so the bathroom was the first place I checked when we went into our room. I was pleasantly surprised, it was very clean, no mildew, stain, dirt, dust...... The rest of the room was also clean but very very small, the room was all beds, 4 twin beds for the 3 of us. For the lack of closet and shelf space, we used the 4th bed to lay out our clothes. Here are a few complaints and our tips, the odd looking old hair dryer which took forever to dry my hair, so bring your own hair dryer. The bottom of the shower curtain wouldn't stay put during the shower, it was flying all over the place! We tried anchoring it with wet towels and clips but to no avail. Finally the battle with the shower curtain ended when we stuffed the bottom into the handle that was on the side of the tub. The hotel is conveniently located, the metro is just a few minutes away and many restaurants are within walking distance. Front desk service was just ok. The room and bathroom are small but if you're just looking for a clean and a quiet room, a comfortable bed and close proximity to sights then this is the place to stay.

<Content>Very Bad Experience After a trip to the Loire Valley, we spent one night at this hotel before flying out of Paris. The room was tiny, dark and depressing. The carpet was filthy, paint was peeling off the bathroom door, the bedding was stained and the staff was rude. We requested a double bed and got two tiny twins pushed together. We requested a non-smoking room and got a smoking room. We were told that they have very few non-smoking rooms yet they adverstise their non-smoking rooms as a feature. Absolutely will never stay there again.

<Content>A wonderful experience My friend and I took our moms to Paris earlier this month. It was a first trip to the lovely city for all of us and we stayed at this hotel. Don't be thrown off by the boutique factor. This hotel has plenty of charm, the location was excellent (a block away from the metro) and the staff was wonderful and friendly. The neighborhood had everything you can imagine and you get the sense of a true Parisian experience.

<Content>Friendly Front Desk Staffers This was my sixth trip to Paris, and my first stay at the Opera. For the money, you can't find a better hotel based on cleanliness, helpfulness of front desk staff, breakfast selections, and convenience to many popular destinations. It was a 15 minute walk to the Galeria and Printemps, the Opera House, and very close to the bus and Metro. I plan to stay at the Opera again.

<Content>Opera Cadet..Great little hotel! I was at the Opera Cadet in 2000 with a group of 35 women. Despite the lack of speaking ability between our group and hotel staff, they had us settled in our rooms within a 1/2 hour.Clean, modern rooms with a great location....Metro, brassiere on corner, take away in the middle of the block, bakery, wine shop, chocolate shop, and greengrocer daily on this great block. Money exchange and supermarket were around the corner....and...the main stores are blocks away. And of course there's the old Opera.Michel was the concierge/bartender and daily we would exchange our adventures and he would give us advise on sightseeing or steer us towards the hottest clubs.All in all, a great trip made possible by an accomodating hotel.

<Content>Good experience My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in mid-July, 2004. This was my first time to Continental Europe and her 4th or 5th, so I was shocked that the room was small. However, as another reviewer noted, you quickly get used to small places when in Paris and after a few minutes, it seemed fine. The room was clean and efficient. The breakfasts were good (I too would have preferred some cold cuts - but alas, it was not to be - there's a McDonalds next to the Metro entrance if you really crave it - fyi - we did not go there!). The 'Metropolitain' (Metro / subway) was 1/4 block away and very convenient - you can go everywhere from here and we did! The hotel is on a nice quiet street (amazing given the hustle and bustle of Paris). Overall a good experience. I would recommend this place.

<Content>I love it! Well, I stayed there with my parents for 7 days and it was perfect! We liked that the room was exactly like the ones we saw on the internet, very clean and very warm. The people are very friendly and polite. The only thing with - was the breakfast(continental) because it's strange eating only croissants and eggs...It's a pleasant and sweet hotel.We'd stay there anytime!(My mom says it' s a jewel)Au revoir!

<Content>Great value for money Tripadvisor saved my day. I was about to be sent to another hotel (the Mondial) by a local agency and when I looked it up it turned out to be a dump. So I opted for Oper脿 Cadet - and I have no regrets.Although the room we were in (112) was rather small, we were still very favourably impressed by the cleanliness of the place as well as by the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. Air-conditioning and sound-proofing were excellent too, as was the pleasant garden-restaurant that our room overlooked.Breakfasts were ample (though some cold meat-cuts would have been appreciated).The hotel is located literally a stone's throw away from the Metr貌 as well as from a variety of good restaurants, serving a variety of dishes. Some quaint shops with reasonably priced foodstuffs are also close by.

<Content>Perfect hotel for 1st trip to Paris We just returned from a week's stay at the Opera Cadet. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Our room seemed small at first glance but we soon adjusted and thought it quite clean and comfortable as well as very quiet. Bathroom had tub and was quite adequate. The area is lovely and within walking distance to many resturants and speciality shops. Metro across street to get to other areas of Paris. The hotel arranged for a shuttle for us to get back to the airport which was great as it went directly to the airport without stopping at other hotels. The breakfast was great every morning. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and would stay here again on our next visit.

<Content>Super Hotel My family spent three nights at the Opera Cadet Hotel in June, 2004. The hotel is well situated, clean, comfortable, and reasonably priced. The hotel is located on a small side street with plenty of food shops and street side vendors. We felt completely safe at and nearby the hotel. A Metro station is within 200 yards of the lobby and a major train station is located about one-half mile away. The hotel was clean and accommodated four guests in our quad room鈥攊t was equipped with two double beds. The room rate included a well rounded continental breakfast. The staff was responsive to all requests for assistance. I strongly recommend this hotel.

It is located on a quiet street in a great neighborhood with a metro stop that is a stone's throw from the front door. Our room was comfortable and the breakfast each morning was excellent. This hotel made our stay a perfect experience because we love Paris.

<Content>Honeymoon in Paris We stayed at this hotel the first couple of nights on our honeymoon and were very satisfied. The front desk people were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was in a very convinient location with metro stops just about any direction from the hotel. It made getting around the city for sight seeing very easy. The rooms were nicely sized, and seemed very clean. All in all, I'd definitely go back!
