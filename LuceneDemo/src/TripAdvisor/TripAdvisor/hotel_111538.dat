<Content>A very nice surprise.. My stay at the Cooper Aerobics Center was organised for me by the Dallas based company I was visiting. They had heard I enjoyed running etc. Lovely spacious rooms, amazingly comfortable bed, very quiet (no door banging or noisy late night drinkers) and fabulous fitness facilities. The previous review was spot on - its like being on a very smart university campus. Lots of interesting history too.The staff were REALLY friendly and couldn't do enough. I will certainly return if I come back to Dallas

<Content>Good excercise facility, a little tired looking My stay at this hotel was off to a good start when I was upgraded to a very large suite named for a famous Texas figure. I had a hallway, bar, living room and bedroom. Extremely spacious! I thought while it was nice, it had some deferred maintenance, such as the rose colored carpet faded in spots and needed to be replaced. The bathroom, while large and nice, needed to be updated because it screamed 1980 to me.On the weekday, there was a free continetal breakfast, but the room was in horrible condition, not at all nice.I ate in the almost empty dining room which aslo needed to be updated, because it looked very 1975 to me. The food was just OK.The ground are lovely and a very large campus. The buildings looked like they needed to be repainted about 3 years ago. The excercise facility was nice, but also a little old looking. I belong to The Houstonian in Houston, ( the first Prez Bush is a member) and it is the workout facility at Cooper was not nearly as nice as The Houstonian.Tip: If you did not bring your laptop, they have a free computer with internet access for guests.

<Content>Wow, what a find! I attended a small meeting at this place, which I had only briefly heard of as more of a fitness center. The grounds made me feel if I had stepped back onto a small, private university. Very well kept grounds, friendly staff (love that Texas hospitality!), and a casual atmosphere. The campus itself is huge, but the staff is warm and welcoming. Free wireless internet, cable TV, huge rooms - bed was a bit too firm for me - and gorgeous bathrooms. For business travelers they have the free wireless, a business center, complimentary continental breakfast. Nice pool area for families and children. I was there during summer youth camp and was expected to find kids all over the place, but not true - they were all at the pool during the day but otherwise not seen. A great property for everyone, and nearby to other restaurants and stores.

<Content>Highly recommended My wife and I evacuated ourselves and my mother in anticipation of Hurricane Rita. This was the lastlodging in Dallas with 5 continuous days vacancy.I did not know if we were going to the No_Tel Motel.My wife called me upon arrival to say that it was themost luxurious fat farm she had ever seen. Beautiful rooms, free WiFi,HUGE olympic lap pool, gorgeous workout gym with individualLCD screens on each treadmill, and restaurants where you donot have to go through an elaborate cross-examination of thewaiter to keep the extra butter off the entre.Expect a well-manicured campus typical of a small SouthernBaptist college. There is a Whole Foods store down the street withmore young woman who have had cosmetic surgery than we have ever seen in Houston.

<Content>Awesome Escape What a wonderful surprise! This hotel was located on the most beautiful campus I have ever seen. It is like you are at a weekend retreat right in the heart of Dallas. I had no idea you could stay here until a friend of mine suggested it, and it couldn't have been better. The staff is so nice and courteous, and because of the small size, you get personal attention. It feels a little like camp for grownups becuase you have access to the awesome fitness center and the 2 heated pools. There is a track that weaves throughout the campus for walking or jogging, and the scenery is gorgeous. There are ponds, flowers, tress, and even ducks and squirrels. You can park right up next to the building, and parking is free. They have a wonderful spa that I took full advantage of, and also 2 restaurants. One is more formal dining, and the other is sort of like a deli with sandwiches and smoothies. The food there is so good, and most of it is good for you. I was so impressed with how clean my room was when I got back to it...you could literally eat off the floor! And, they have free turndown service at night...it really make you feel important. Everyone there was so nice and the place was so awesome that I will definately be staying there for all of my Dallas visits.
