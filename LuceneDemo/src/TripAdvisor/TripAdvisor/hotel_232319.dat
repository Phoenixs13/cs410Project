<Content>Outsourced Innkeeping? Who ever heard of a hotel where the front desk is actually at another hotel? Perhaps it's a clever way to save money, but it creates some very strange inconveniences. We arrived before dawn in a driving rainstorm, but found the Concert Inn easily. Once we pulled up with our luggage, we found a sign on the door explaining that reception was handled at the Ramada in two doors down. Dragging our wet luggage behind, we made arrangements to check in when the room was ready. At check-in, we were informed that there was only a single key for the double room, and if we wanted to split up, we could leave the key at reception -- but it's two doors down from where we were staying! This turned into a major hassle in a city that is known for its nightlife, given that we are two independent adults who don't always want to do everything together.There were a number of other little inconveniences. For instance, our room was on the fourth floor, but the elevator only went up to the third floor. There was no public telephone in the lobby; we had to walk out to a booth on the street to use the prepaid car sold at the front desk. The annoyances added up. It was youth hostel treatment at hotel prices.The room, though small, was cheerfully decorated, and the electric kettle made our stay in the gloomy weather much more cozy. However, housekeeping was very lax about replacing tea and coffee supplies, and linens were only changed once during an 8-night stay. Three separate requests were needed to get extra pillows. The location is quiet and residential, but very convenient to tram stops and the museum district. We were surprised, though, at how few restaurants and cafes there were in the area, given the surrounding museums and, of course, the concert hall.
