<Content>Bed, Breakfast, Free internet all under 9000 yen for a couple in tokyo We've found out about this hotel in the Kyoto branch. A great western style hotel for travelers on the budget. location in just about 3 minutes walk from the JR Kamata station, (which is about 6 stops from tokyo station), rooms all have internet access, breakfast is served for free including pastries, salad and drinks. all together, one of the best hotels when considering the cost.
