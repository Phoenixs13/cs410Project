<Content>Advise earplugs Enjoyed this hotel. Convenient location for La Rambla and Place Catalunya. Good breakfast and pleasant staff. However, I would recommend taking ear plugs. Had a room on the street-side and the street noise went on until well after 3am, and within the hotel there was noise from banging doors etc and, despite the high ceilings there seemed to be lots of noise from very heavy-footed people above. But I enjoyed my stay. It was a good sized room and the bed was really comfortable and good shower which was appreciated.

<Content>Just OK Just got back from spending 3 nights in Barcelona at this hotel. The good points are the price bearing in mind the excellent location at the top of La Rambles and a short walk to the underground station and the shops. However the hotel rooms are in need of a revamp and i found the breakfast very bland. The rooms were cleaned daily but were very small and lacked tea making facilities. The air conditioning is turned off during the day and the walls are extremely thin. A little tip for Barcelona, get the hotel to book your Restaurant. All the best Restaurants have long queues and thats not what you need after a long hard day sightseeing!!! Also purchase your underground tickets as a book of 10 trips its alot cheaper than buying singles. You will use all ten believe me...

<Content>Terrible Customer service Uk 23.08.08We just returned from spending 5 nights in Barcelona. Our Stay was at the Meson Castilla...we chose this hotel because they described themselves as a friendly,warm , family run hotel. The staff were neither friendly or warm...there was absolutely no customer service, at times they were rude and ignorant, we never had any conversation or questions relating to whether our stay was satisfactory. On arrival, the weather was extremely hot and humid, we were quite disappointed that the ac wasn't left on in the room, so we had to wait for the room to cool down before doing anything.Although there was a gentleman holding the doors open in reception...we didn't get help with our cases!We spent 5 nights here, the bed linen never got changed untill the 4th day when i queried this , they apparently told us it was changed daily....we knew it hadn't been changed for 4 days, quite appauling and un hygenic considering the weather was extremely hot.We were completely confined to sitting either in reception or our bedroom, although the hotel had other seating areas with tables etc the air conditioning was always switched off making it unbearable to sit anywhere else apart from reception which we didn't fancy because of the unfriendly staff.The advertised terrace is only accessible during breakfast time!Although rooms are air conditioned, the hotel switches the AC off from 9-1am during the morning which causes inconvenience if you happen to be in the hotel at those times.The Hotel is also situated down a back street leading to the Ramblas, during the daytime this street is busy but during the evening it is quiet and i would advise not to wander down this street alone.We woud have overlooked all of the above if we had customer service, but the staff were very unfriendly, very rarely greeted us, even on leaving they never said bye or i hope you enjoyed your stay...I would never reccomend this hotel, CUSTOMER SERVICE is important whether its a 2 star or 5 star hotel.The good point was that we quite often visited 'The Cellar Tapas bar' this was up the road close to our hotel ....they served great food, although it was small the staff were friendly, it was buzzing, and we went back a few times because they gave us great customer service.

<Content>Great Holiday Good position for Las Ramblas and Metro. Rooms adequate and maid service daily and staff on the whole friendly and helpful. However, stay just spoilt by theft of jewellry and cash from locked hotel room even though key handed into Reception, no sign of break in and 24 hour reception cover. Would advise to use safety deposit box (in reception) at all times no matter how short a time you are out of your room. Hotel staff only made cursory enquiries with maid and reported to manager. SO BE CAREFUL as this is something that happens

<Content>Location, Location, Location AND Cheap I stayed at Hotel Meson Castilla with my husband, 22 year old daughter and 16 year old son. The hotel staff were charming and we all loved it's old world style. We booked a family room for 4 but came in a day earlier than planned. We were given 2 separate rooms as the family room wasnt available offered at the 1 room price which we were all very happy with.It's been said by many other reviewers but we loved the location - it was perfect and offered something for all our differing tastes eg. a very cool vintage shop directly opposite for my daughter, skateboarding with the locals at MACBA for my son (just round the corner) and shopping, arts and food in Ravel and the Barri Gotic that we all enjoyed. It was also a close walk to the fabulous El Born area and we couldn't have asked for more. We also drove to Barcelona and found the carpark both cheap and very accessible under the hotel. In regards to other comments about the danger of the area - I would tell you it's just like any other major city. I dont drop my guard in my own home city and we treated Barcelona the same, didnt have any issues and felt very safe.

<Content>Ideal hotel and location for a short visit to Barcelona Just returned from a 4 day break to Barcelona. The hotel is ideally place 5 minutes from the Playa da Catalunya where you can catch buses to all locations, or walk to the many wonderful sights the city has to offer. The hotel is reached down narrow streets, but we felt quite safe to walk them at night. The area is renowned for its music shops, but is also undergoing some redevelopment.The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful throughout our stay. They also provided safe storage for our cases after checking out and before leaving for the airport. When we arrived we requested extra pillows and these were provided immediately. The rooms were comfortable and clean, with fresh towels every day. The only downside was that our room had a window on to an internal light well, so it was difficult to check the weather!Breakfast was buffet style with a good variety and more than you could eat.We would quitel happily recommend this hotel to friends or use it again.

<Content>Central, quiet, careful budget The previous reviews shows very different reactions to this hotel, which are useful in guaging what one's own reaction might be. My observation is that it very near the Placa de la Catalunya, at the top end of main section section of the Ramblas, so very central - a definite plus. It is an attractive building on a quieter side road, not an attractive one, but then again not on the Ramblas or a main thoroughfare - another definite plus. I asked for a quiet room at the back of the hotel, near the top, and had a reasonable view (no. 575) - yet another definite plus. The water pressure in the tap became a problem, although the shower kept going. The rooms are somewhat small, slightly dingy, and the furniture 'quaint'. The interior walls are thin, although we only shared one internal wall; all rooms lead off the central lift/stairwell. The breakfast was reasonably varied. The staff were fine, then again I tried to use my terrible Spanish as far as I could. Beforehand, they did not respond to emails, but I used my tour operator communicate my special requests. The Reding round the corner is more modern, with a restaurant, but might be noisier? There are also roadworks near both hotels.

<Content>Definately go back Stayed here for four nights (end Jan - beg Feb) with two teenagers. Had a little trouble finding it initially going up and down alleyways and wondering what we were letting ourselves in for. When we did find Hotel Meson Castilla we were very pleasantly surprised - the hotel has a lovely frontage and welcoming lobby, staff very pleasant and helpful. We had a triple room - small but adequate, very clean - the only downside we didn't have a balcony but not terrible as we only there in the evening after plenty of sightseeing! Breakfast room lovely and spacious - plenty to eat to set us up for the day, weather too cold to sit in lovely garden. Our flight was late in evening and no problem leaving luggage in hotel after we checked out. Very close to La Rambla and all main areas, we had no problems with any unsavoury characters. Will definately recommend to family and friends (have already done so) and will definately return to Meson Castilla.

<Content>Little Gem The location is excellent - just far enough away from La Rambla to escape the touristy madness there and yet perfect for lugging a suitcase from the metro station/airport bus on Placa Cataluyna. The area is a mix of old residential and student quarter so it is lively but the noise is just mopeds and chatter and rooms to the front have internal and external shutters so it's easy to block it out. Some guidebooks warn of a red light district and there is one small area about eight-ten minutes walk away that is certainly open for business at night but the atmosphere isn't threatening. The hotel itself is very good value for the price - they've made an effort with the furnishings which give a nice olde world character and while the rooms are small and not very sophisticated, everything's in working order, the beds are good and the cleaning very thorough. Staff were very pleasant and happy to hold on to bags until night time on the day of departure, and breakfast is brilliant for late starters - served from 7-11 and there's plenty of it. The lack of a bar shouldn't be a put-off - there are a good few late night corner shops around so buy a bottle of wine and curl up on one of the leather chairs or sofas in the lobby or first floor common area and read by the big standard lamps - the perfect way to end a day.

<Content>Be wary of the location! 27th January 2008I stayed in this hotel as part of a group earlier this month. Whilst I agree with other reviews that this hotel is very clean and the breakfast is adequate I would warn people of the location. It is worth noting that before we checked in we were handed a leaflet on personal safety and to be wary of handbag thieves. We had been warned and I have stayed in Barcelona previously . None the less, that evening my friend and I were mugged and my friend's bag was stolen. In the struggle I was knocked to the ground and sustained substantial injuries to my face. This all happend literally around the corner of the hotel. One of the problems with the hotel is that there is no bar or place to buy coffee. There is a coffee machine at reception but this is not ideal. I doubt if we would have gone out late in the evening had there been a bar in the hotel . I have noted that in some websites that is lists a bar at this hotel but we did not see one. Two other members of the group had a similar experience the next day at a cash machine on the Ramblas. I would advise anyone, if they must go to Barcelona to stay on a main street and avoid hotels in side streets. The police are less than helpful. It took three attempts to get them to take a report and on the last occasion, it was due to a nice young policeman that took pity on us. It's seem that you must talk to the police through an official interpreter if you don't speak the language, and waiting for one takes forever. It's pointless really as the police will do nothing about the crime anyway. If you need to,try to report to the tourist police. (I was informed of this later). The police would like to blame 'other' nationalites for the spate of handbag snatching but it both incidents they were young well dressed spanish/catalan youths. The authorities do not take this crime seriously. It's seems to be very much accepted. I know too many that suffered similar fates in Barcelona. There are other cities in Europe that are well worth seeing. My advice for what it is worth if you have not booked your flights, go elsewhere!One other thing, there are roadwork or construction near this hotel and the noise is deafening. That alone should drive you away!

<Content>Very nice The hotel is rated two stars, but it could well deserve more. Clean, spacious, furnished with a light, unkitschy touch of Spainity. Good complimentary breakfast, held in a real breakfast room. Rooms with a nice balcony, kept very clean (daily change of sheets and towels). Staff kind and discreete, speaking several languages. Very central position, in the free time you can walk along The Ramblas and enjoy the core of Barcelona life. Fare acceptable, taken into account also the central position. I recommend it.

<Content>staff ruined it The hotel itself is fine, no frills, simple, good location. I'm glad I am used to traveling in cities and that I speak spanish because the staff was really really unhelpful, they looked so miserable, barely acknowledged our existence. God forbid we needed their advice on where to eat or something. For the price (such a bare bones place) we could have gone to a million other places, so what's the big deal? We stayed in much better places for the price all over Spain during the rest of our trip.

<Content>Noise can be a problem The hotel is in a great location and we found the staff okay.The breakfasts were great however the walls were thin ! Dont know if it was just our room but the first night we were next to three backpackers who obvioulsy got a last minute room and wecould hear EVERYTHING from their room. We complained and the reception staff did contact them to little avail. The next night aquiteer family moved in but we could still hear a lot. Given thehotel is reasonably expensive this did affect our stay quite a bit.Otherwise no complaints..

<Content>pleasent stay we were a little disappointed at first because the room seemed quite small but soon got used to this. There is roadworks going on outside at the front and this created a lot of noise so it was not really possible to have the window open so needed aircon on all the time which was reasonably quiet. The bed was comfortable and bathroom clean. Very nice buffet breakfast either in breakfast room or outside on terrace. Staff were helpful. Great location, felt safe all around, walked pretty much everywhere. Great Tapas bars in roads adjacent to Placa de Catolonya and Gaudi architecture five mins walk away.

<Content>Staff was rude The hotel meson castilla in Barcelona was near Las Ramblas. This is where the postive attributes ended. I had booked two rooms for our trip in July 2007. A double with a cot and a triple with a cot. Upon our arrival we were informed that a cot really means a crib. The woman at the reception desk was quite agrumentative and kept insisting that a cot in any language meant crib. The reception staff was not very eager to assist us and told us that they didn't have any other rooms available.At our insistance she made a few phone calls to the other Husa International Hotels of which Hotel Meson is a part and found rooms for us. The photos online of Hotel Meson make it appear old world charm when in reality it's just old world. The rooms are quite small but clean . Breakfast was pretty good. All in all this hotel was not worth the price.Aggie WeilSyosset, NY

<Content>Noisy! I stayed at the Hotel Meson Castilla for a week this May. At first I stayed in a room at the front of the hotel with a friend. It was quite possibly the noisiest place I have ever stayed! Perhaps because the room was at the front of the building, but it was really really bad! Later I moved to a room further back, this was slightly better but very dark and quite dated. Overall the hotel has a certain faded charm and the breakfast area (roof terrace) is quite nice. Staff tended to be rather abrupt and even rude but were reasonably helpful when necessary. I booked my stay here having read many glowing reviews on Trip Advisor, and while the location is good, I would not recommend this hotel so highly.

<Content>Wonderful Stay! This hotel is a great deal. I stayed here on a college trip. The rooms were so cute! The bathrooms and bedrooms were very nice, clean and spacious. The hotel is in a perfect location just minutes from las Ramblas where you can walk to Picasso museum and the Port. Major shopping and the double decker tour bus origination is just 5-10 min walking distance away. Even the Olympic Port is only a $10 taxi ride away. There are several nice tapas bars around. Breakfast is served every morning which is nice. Daily housekeeping did a great job. The area around it looks a little shady at night but we felt perfectly safe. Our room overlooked the front street and we had an adorable mini window that opened onto the street.

<Content>Excellent location and great all rounder This hotel is in an excellent location for walking to Placa Catalunya, Las Ramblas, the metro, the tour bus stop, etc. There are some shops nearby and vending machines in the hotel.My main concern during our stay was the road from Las Ramblas is a pedestrianised one and felt like dodgy territory at night (we saw a woman have her handbag snatched or at least the chap tried, she was a burly lass!). Other than this (don't head out alone at night), it was difficult to find fault. The rooms had everything you needed except tea/coffe making facilities and the brekkie was great with something for everyone. Children are welcomed and there are settees on all landings (some right outside the rooms conveniently). There is a lift and a roomy reception area. We spent some time trying to find our way to the outside terrace (not the breakfast one) but one of our party had a terrace outside their room anyway. Would go there again :-)

<Content>hotel fantastico! Vive le Rock! Gorgeous decor and ambience. Brilliant breakfast: coffee, juice, cold meats, fresh bread rolls, cereals, tortilla, fresh fruit and scrummy pastries. Staff were extremely helpful and accomodating; especially when we attempted to speak our very limited Spanish, (which always brought a smile, if not fits of giggles). Rooms have air conditioning. Double beds are big enough for four! Bathrooms have sink, wc, bidet, bath and 'hand' shower. Everything was very clean and towels and sheets changed daily. Basic, but very comfortable and everything you need. Area is perfect if you like heavy metal, rock or gothic nightlife and shopping. Valhalla club de rock is about ten paces from the front door! Don't let the graffiti put you off...streets are hosed down during the night and bins emptied every hour or so. There is never any litter. Vast number of eateries on the doorstep, 2 mins walk to Las Ramblas ( but we kept off it as very dodgy ). Easy walk to Barri Gotic, which is full of quirky shops, bars and beautiful architecture. Barcoloneta and beach about 30 mins walk (cos there's so much to look at, it seems like half that).

<Content>Quite decent for the price Pros:+Central location - easy to walk to major sites and transport+Room and bathroom were very clean and bathroom/furnishings in good condition+Contrary to other reviews, though perhaps not overtly friendly, staff was actually quite polite+The breakfast included in the price was very satisfying, though it did not vary at all during the course of our stayCons:-The actual street where the hotel is located is not very picturesque (grafitti on the building opposite, etc)-The hotel has an outdated 1970s feel (lobby and rooms have bathroom tile-type floors) rather than trendy/funky feel as advertised/reviewed in many magazinesOverall, the Meson Castilla was a very good value, though not a particularly interesting place to stay. On my next trip to Barcelona, I will look for a hotel that has a little more character, but would not be displeased to stay at the Meson Castilla again.

<Author>The_Shaddow
<Content>Lovely Hotel, Very Central I loved the atmosphere of the hotel, it was very confortable and the decore appeared to be very Spannish. It seamed to cater to both spanish people and a wide range of other nations. My room was compact and basic but very comfortable with decent storage units (with a good supply of hangers) and a combination shower and bath. The bath was very small so I don't think most people could lie down fully streached in it. The breakfast was basic but it had a variety of cereals (including muesli and cornflakes), 2 different types of pastries (which changed each day) and 3 different types of bread and rolls (including bread you could use to make your own toast). They had both ordinary milk (hot and cold) and Soya milk. As previously mentioned they have a left luggage facility and safes available off the reception area. They ask for a 25 Euro deposit to use the safe but you get it back when you return the keyAll of the hotel staff were all very friendly and were able to offer good advice when asked.If you're traveling by foot from Placa Catalunya, one of the easiest ways to get to the the hotel is going down the Rambas and take the first street on the right after Pelai which is called Tallers. At the end of Tallers on tthe left you will come to Valldoncella (its can be called Valldonzella on street signs/ maps) and near the start of the street you will see the hotel (th street is before Placa Castella). Would definately stay at the hotel on my next visit to Barcelona!

<Content>Great Location A great hotel if your looking for basic accomodation that is very central. It's close to Las Ramblas and most touristic places are walkable. The room was ok. The breakfast was appalling. Very little choice but nice tortilla! They allow you to keep your bags in a storage room which was great, as we were there on a city break and did not have transfers. What was good, but also slightly offputting were the warning on arrival of all the street crime and muggings and charlatans out to rob you of your mobile, money and cameras. Certainly, spent the first few days being very wary but thankfully no problems!! Lots of people warned me about the crime rate in Barcelona before I left!Recommend taking the tourist bus which will enable you to see all of the major attractions with minimum wear and tear on your feet. The tourist bus literally drives from one attraction to another. Altogether there are three routes and it is suprising what you can accomplish in a day.Eateries tend to be better off Las Ramblas.The living statues are quite interesting especially Che Guevarra!!Santa Familia and Guadi's house, Parc Guell is also very nice.

<Content>The Spanish Experience Just returned back from the Lovely Meson Castilla.On arrival from our monarch flight, cases and all went to get a taxi..We arrived at the hotel in 20 mins, costing 29. euros which is quite pricey, although there is a shuttle bus you can get from outside the Corte de Ingles Dept Store that are frequent and cheap.We checked in straight away, we requested a terrace and we got room 243 which was tradional and quite, very spanish and IGNORE comments about staff they were very friendly and helpful.I have visited this hotel and barcelona before so I knew what the Immediate Vacinty and where to go.Do not go to any restaurants on the ramblas they are out to rip you off and when asked for tapas IE patatas bravas they were not, and they do not offer glasses of wine only by the bottle.Try off the ramblas and back streets.Wine very cheap and the supermarket called carrefour on the ramblas is fab.Hardrock cafe a must for people who only want chips burgers etc, however a good atmosphere.Macdoanlds and Kfc are better in spain than england, but I do prefer spanish food.All sites amazing and Sagra Famila is outstanding.We went on 09/12 and it is very christmasy shopping is brill.Will be going back someday as it is an amzing city. do recommend this hotel for anyone that wants comfort cheap and traditional.Enjoy

<Content>Nice building, central location This is part of the Husa hotels chain. Located on a side street close to Placa Catalunya and Placa Universitat, and a hundred yards from La Rambla, this hotel is ideally located for touring the old town. The building is very olde worlde, with a very nice first floor dining room and patio. Some rooms have small balconies overlooking the street or internal courtyards, and most bedrooms are en suite.We found the hotel and our room to be comfortable, and the reception staff to be reasonably helpful, though not especially friendly. Our room had a small TV, although apart from BBC World and Sky News, most channels were Spanish or Catalan.We had two fairly minor quibbles. First, the noise. Our room overlooked Carrer Valdonzella, and the noise was intrusive until the early hours of the morning. If this is of concern, it would be best to ask for an inward facing room. Second, whilst the breakfast was adequate, it was hardly inspiring, with a rather limited and unchanging choice.The immediate area (northern Raval) is rather run down, with graffiti all over the place. However this adds to the genuine character and charm of the area. There are several good value restaurants within easy walking distance, some offering excellent value set menus. We would recommend in particular the Biblioteca in Carrer Junta de Comerc.

<Content>Basic, clean, well located. I stayed in the Meson Castilla for 4 nights in early November 06. The hotel is only a few minutes walk to La Rambla so is very well located. I had asked for a triple room but got a twin room with an extra camp bed. The camp bed was actually comfortable but the room was a little cramped. The bathroom was a decent size. Overall the room was basic but clean. The hotel has six floors but the lift only goes to the 5th floor. Our room was on the 6th floor so we had to drag ourselves and our suitcases up two flights of stairs. Not a problem if you are fit and healthy but if you have any kind of back problem I鈥檇 get another room. Fortunately there are only 2 rooms on the 6th floor. The lift is small and can just about hold 3 people with their suitcases.The hotel offers breakfast until 11am which is great but often there wasn鈥檛 much food out on the buffet table after 10.00am. Staff will replenish if you ask them to do but you need to ask as they don鈥檛 seem to check food supplies themselves. Breakfast was just ok. It consisted of orange juice (straight from the largest catering can I have ever seen), toast, various breads, cereal, yoghurt and fruit. Also some strange looking cold (processed) meat which I avoided. The staff were very quiet in manner and there weren鈥檛 that many smiles on offer so I can see why other reviewers might have perceived them to be a little 鈥榤iserable鈥? That aside, I found them helpful when I needed assistance. The hotel has a 24 hour front-desk so arriving late at night is not a problem.Two restaurants I would recommend would be Attic (over the Nike shop) on La Rambla and Taxidermista on Placa Reial. The food in both restaurants was very good and reasonably priced. Service was also good. Menus available in English in both restaurants.

<Content>Good Value We stayed here for one night on a stopover. The hotel is in an ideal location as it is just off La Rambla so within walking distance of everything in central Barcelona. Having read the reviews on Tripadvisor, I made the booking directly with the hotel and asked for a room on an upper floor. We got a top floor room with a lovely little balcony. The room was not luxurious - a little shabby, but clean. There is one small lift which can be a pain during busy times. We made use of the garage for 24hrs at a reasonable rate. I can understand that the staff may have been viewed as unfriendly by other viewers - they were certainly bored and not particularly cheerful. I speak fluent Spanish so I have to say they were extremely helpul giving directions to the hotel when we got lost in the car and they were also happy to order us a cab to the restaurant that evening. The hotel was a bargain considering it's location and I would stay there again if travelling on a tight budget.

<Content>Great location, but shocking staff! I have just spent a weekend at the Mason Castilla in Barcelona. This hotel whilst good value for money, nice terrace for b/fast and has average rooms - has the most unfriendly and unhelpful front desk staff.It was impossible to get them to book a restaurant, and if you do not speak spanish, this is a difficult task! Also, we tried to find out what time the bus left to take us back to the airport but again, they would not call the bus company.Basically, the staff at the front desk do not understand or practice GOOD SERVICE or even basic service for that matter. Any reqeust, even checking in or retrieving a key was dealt with in an icy manner and I never once saw a smile !

<Content>Miserable staff, fantastic location My mum and I stayed in Hotel Meson Castilla for four nights in August. The rooms were clean and adequate. Very impressive maid service with sheets and towels changed daily. The location of the hotel is excellent as you can reach La Ramblas and Catalunia square by foot within minutes. The reception staff however were miserable and did not go out of their way to make you feel welcome. On our first evening the bathroom became flooded after heavy rain coming through the patio floor and when we asked for more towels to mop it up, they suddenly lost all ability to speak or understand English (amazingly the next night when we had no problem for them to deal with they understood everything we said perfectly!!!)We had no problems with noise at all as most of the nightclubs etc seemed to be on their Summer breaks. I would recommend the hotel for people visiting Barcelona who want a central, clean and small hotel.Please be careful with the street crime in Barcelona, we had our purse stolen on day two and when we went to report it at the police station there were lots of people there in the same situation.

<Content>Great location!!! The hotel is located in the best place as the highstreet shops and La Rambla are just around the corner.There are a lot of small side streets full of shops around the hotel. It does get quite noisy as it is in a busy, run down place and doesnt help with there being a night club just outside the hotel, but being on the 5th floor did help. The hotel is very clean however the pictures are slightly misleading. A couple of the staff were miserable and give you one word answers but the rest were fine. The safes are kept downsairs, a deposit of 25 euros has to be given upfront and it will be returned to you when you give back the key. Drinks from the mini bar cost 1.80 euros. Overall nice hotel based in the center but not for those who like a quiet atmosphere

<Content>Excellent find My friend and myself stayed here for 1 night on the 8th June and what a great find. Very good location with a very Spainish feel about it. The rooms had everything we wanted, Bed's very comfortable, Shower excellent and the air conditioning was perfect. Breakfast included in the price with a very good selection, you can sit inside or outside.They was very helpful, when we checked in they supplied maps, tours information and highlighted that you are in a city and you should be aware of your surroundings, with simple steps for safety. They directed us to some good places to eat.We was able to leave our luggage and keep our safe desposit box until the evening of the 9th, when we went back to collect our luggage they ordered us a taxi to go to the airport which was there in 5 mins.Excellent stay which made a one night stay seem like we had been pampered for a week.

<Content>Meson Castilla - a great find If you are looking for a value for money hotel (the room rate includes a very good buffet breakfast), that is close to the Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas, then I would recommend the Meson Castilla hotel that is located on Carrer de Valldoncella. The hotel opened in 1952 and has a very interesting interior and some really amazing furniture.My wife and I have just returned from a 4 night stay in the Meson Castilla and had a really great time. The bedroom was simply furnished but was very comfortable.The staff were helpful with any queries we had and checkout on 7 April was very quick.The area where the hotel is located is undergoing a major regeneration. Don't be put off by the narrow alleyways and general appearance of the area. The area has some great restaurants (we had fantastic tapas in a small deli and restaurant in Carrer dels Tallers) and for cakes and pastries you can't beat the bakeries in Barcelona.The hotel proved to be an ideal base for exploring the city by foot as many of the sights we wanted to visit such as Barri Gotic, the port, Casa Mila, Catedral de la Seu, and La Sagrada Famillia were within walking distance. For other sights that are further away such as Park Guell, Fundacio Joan Miro and Poble Espanyol we made use of the hop on, hop off Barcelona Bus Turistic - a 2 day pass costs 22 euros.We can't wait to return to Barcelona - there is so much to see and do.

<Content>Too noisy to sleep! Do not stay at this hotel if you want to sleep at all. We stayed three nights and were exhausted at the end of the stay. Not only did the street noise keep you awake but the walls are paper thin. The rooms are very small and definitely two star. The staff is not very helpful. The one great thing about the hotel was the location and the dining area and breakfast.

<Content>Good value and a very clean room My daughter and I stayed at Meson Castilla 2 nights pre-cruise and 1 night post-cruise in Nov. 2005The rooms were small but they were very clean!! Pre-cruise our rooms were on the front, the street noise keep us awake even with a sleeping pill.Post-cruise we had a room in the back which was much quieter. The breakfast buffet had a good selection to choice from. One of the ladies that worked in the breakfast room helped my daughter practice her spanish.The staff was friendly and helpful.I would stay here again!!

<Content>good deal, good location, noisy We reserved a quadruple for four adults and our one year old. We stayed right above the front door was noisy for the front room (it was a two room suite). It was ten times louder in our room than the lobby. The rooms were super clean!! The staff was not very nice. They did not seem to want o go out of their way. I even noticed them being rude to other patrons. The rate was great and included breakfast. the breakfast was awesome - not just coffee and bread. If you want a good deal with a good location it works.

<Content>charming yet small hotel this hotel overall is in a good location (5 minute walk to catalunya plaza) and is relatively inexpensive. however, our room was quite small (we expected that) and our private bathroom was not connected to our room (we had to walk through the hallway), which we were not expecting! the walls are thin as other reviewers had mentioned, but we did not experience any loud noises to complain of. our room also had a cute veranda that opened up to some plants in a mini-patio. the buffet breakfast was more than adequate and was quite good!! the staff at the front desk were not the most helpful people i have ever encountered in the hotel industry (as far as suggestions, etc) but were pleasant nonetheless.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Great Location! My family and I stayed at the Meson Castilla Hotel for four nights in August 05. I booked direct with the hotel and received a very good deal for a room for four (Family rooms are like gold dust in Barcelona). The location was excellent being only a short walk to the Ramblas and our favourite Hard Rock caf茅 (not very Spanish - but good value and good food). Many of the reviews have commented on the area being a little seedy but we had a three year old and a five year old and never felt threatened or uneasy. The university is very close by and the area was very studenty with lots of music shops and boutiques selling young fashion. The large amount of Graffiti has also been mentioned but we actually found it incredible and it has obviously been done by some very talented young artists. The room we stayed in was adequate, not as large as some family rooms we have stayed in but we spent very little time in there anyway. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the dining room and surrounding area was traditional Spanish which made a nice change from the sterile modern places we had stayed in previously. The breakfast was a typically continental affair consisting of cold meat, a variety of bread, yoghurt and fruit but it provided a good start for the day.I would definitely stay at the Meson Castilla again; Barcelona is a beautiful, fascinating city. If I had to give any negative comments it would be that the walls are very thin and everything can be heard in the next room - so take heed any honeymooners!!

<Content>Good value for money I stayed here with my friend for 3 nights. The location is excellent and very close to pretty much everything you want to see, including the bus services to the airport and around Barcelona. When I opened the room door, I thought they had given me the key to the cupboard by mistake! There was no real natural light as the window was too small. However, the room was spotless, the bed very comfortable, the bathroom small but very adequate for one and it had a great shower. The breakfast room was lovely and I thought the breakfast selection very good, as I have experienced some terrible breakfasts in Europe. The staff were stern but efficient and proved more than helpful when pushed to answer a tricky question. Good value for money and I would recommend it to friends who were on a budget.

<Content>Good, Affordable Accommodation We stayed at the Meson Castilla for three nights with 2 children, ages 6 and 8. We had a large family room; actually 2 interconnecting rooms, each with two single beds, a wardrobe, desk and TV. The layout was superb, affording the children plenty of space and giving us a bit of privacy. The room was spotlessly clean and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was fine, with plenty of hot water and water pressure. The furniture was old and somewhat tired ... this is not luxury accommodation. The rate was 鈧?65 per night.The buffet breakfast was OK but nothing out of the ordinary (it was included in the room price). Cereals, some breakfast meat, very ordinary cheese, yougurt, soggy croissants and otherwise good bread. The coffee was good.The only drawback (and this is tiny) to the hotel was the service ... while some of the staff were very friendly, the woman who both checked us in and out was very stern and extremly slow. It took nearly 20 minutes to check in (not acceptable late at night with children) and 25 minutes to check out - with never a hint of a smile.While many people have commented on the 'dodgy' neighbourhood, we felt perfectly safe during the 5-10 minute walk to the Ramblas. There were always plenty of people about, even at 1.30am, and some of the smaller shops has some unique items. The location of the hotel is very good for tourists.In summary, the Meson Castilla is a fine place to stay if you are looking for basic accommodation, and it was great in our case because we had plenty of space for two lively children. But if you are looking for something special, you could do far better.

<Content>OK. But do not stay on the 6th floor! In room 680 My best freind and I visited this hotel for 3 nights in June 2005To get to the room, we took the elevator to the 5th floor and then walked the extra flight up. Our room was one of two on the 6th floor. It was very small and not as plush as their brochure shows. A bit on the shabby side, although clean enough. It felt as though the room had been an after thought. To quote a line from Die Hard 2 the movie  Pack 'em, Rack 'em and Stack 'em.The breakfast room was fine, but one day they ran out of yoghurts which we felt was unacceptable.The reception staff were very helpful (apart from one young girl who could not speak English)6 out of 10ClaireOxfordshire

<Content>Great location and buffet breakfast I stayed at the Hotel Meson Castilla with my brother (25 y.o.) and my mother (~55 y.o.). It was in an upbeat, university neighborhood (perfect for my brother) and just a couple blocks off the Rambla and Placa Cataluyna (perfect for my mother). I loved the old Spanish style and decoration of the hotel. The first room we stayed in was on the top floor and had a wonderful terrace. Yes, it overlooked an ugly office building, but we were high enough to see the palace in the distance and feel a nice breeze. The second room we stayed in was larger, on the second floor, and was quite dark because there was only one small ground-level window. We found the entire hotel very clean, including the bathrooms. The breakfast was great (especially for my brother) and included a variety of breads and pastries, sliced meat, orange juice, cereals and milk, espresso/coffee/tea, yogurt, and tortilla (like a potato quiche). The breakfast--indeed the entire experience--was very Spanish and quite different than your typical, sterile, overly cheery chain hotel experience. We paid more than this site is listing however -- you may want to check with the hotel's web site to confirm:---------

<Content>Nice hotel, convenient location I have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona. The Meson Castilla was located about 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas. Really clean hotel, with nice staff and reasonable breakfast. The rooms were spacious enough and had a tv, mini bar and really good air conditioning system. Traditional Spanish hotel! Luggage room if you are leaving late and safety deposit boxes. On first impressions the location can seem a bit dodgy, but many Barcelona streets can give that impression because they are so narrow. Had no trouble at this hotel and I would definitley stay again due to the handy location.

<Content>Don't do it!!! Not sure where all the guide books get their information, but we (4 of us) found this hotel to be seriously lacking in charm. We did not get what we asked for and were dismissed with a shrug of the shoulders. We were recommended by a guide book to stay in street side rooms as they had more light and so after checking with the hotel, they confirmed 5th floor rooms. We not only did not get these rooms but found ourselves overlooking the backend of another building and a building site. I appreciate that they cannot command the development in their area, but it was the dismissive attitude and the state of the rooms that really got to me. Headboards and cupboards may have been painted with care, but certainly did not make up for the following: cheap decor, tiny musty bathrooms, paperthin walls. Charm long gone. Over rated and not so charming. We did far better just around the corner.

<Content>Good Deal We stayed at Hotel Meson Castilla for three nights and had a very good experience. The hotel is very well located for touring the city. The two largest metro stations are within a five-ten minute walk and the Gothic Quarter, Shopping District, and Les Rambles are also just as close. The hotel is clean, safe, and the staff is able (as with most Spainiards, don't expect a lot of smiles and gratuity). The price and location are the best aspects of this hotel; if you're looking for a place to leave your luggage all day while out playing and then get a good nights sleep, this is the spot for you. If you want the hotel experience of dining, room service (there isn't any), big bathrooms, and luxury, then this isn't your kind of joint. The hotel is very near the University and is situated in a youthful neighborhood; this means the area isn't much too look at (lots of graffitti, not very clean) and has lots of 20-30 year olds out and about at night, but it does feel safe, and offers a lot of great bar experiences, and lots of fantastic shopping and dining during the day (GO TO THE PASTRY SHOP DOWN THE ALLEY/STREET HEADED TOWARDS LES RAMBLES!). As with all cities on the planet: the unsafest street is the street you're on by yourself. I'll be staying at Meson Castilla next time I'm in Barcelona.

<Content>Good location, good value Just got back from 3 nights here and overall were very pleased with our choice (made after reading other reviews). Good location just 5 minutes walk from La Rambla and altho this can be via some narrow streets they are all well lit and we never felt at risk, even though everyone we spoke to and everything we read before going warned us about the notorious (and threatening) pick-pockets. We never saw anything of concern. Comfortable rooms (not large) and good bathrooms (again not large) and all spotlessly clean. All rooms are quite attractive and the communal areas too, particularly the breakfast room. Good breakfast choices, including very fresh croissants which is always a bonus. On the downside, the rooms can be a bit noisy both with sounds from inside the building and from outside. In particular, there is quite a lot of building going on very close to the hotel and while we were there the lorry was arriving to take the full skip away at 4am ready for the builders to kick off again at 7am ! (It may be that not all rooms are affected but certainly those at the front suffer). Other small moan - no tea/coffee making in room - have to rely on vending maching in foyer. Worth considering though.

<Content>Great bars, nice atmosphere We stayed here for three days in March and had a great time. The hotel is in a good location, very central but not too touristy. The back streets described by some people as dirty or seedy actually have the coolest bars in Barcelona - a very happening area if you look beyond the graffiti. Inside, the hotel has a lot of character, the breakfast room and terrace are beautiful, and there are antiques all over the place. I agree with those reviewers who mentioned the noise from other rooms, you might want to bring ear plugs. Our room was small but charming and had everything we needed. The breakfast was better than we expected, a mixture of sweet Spanish stuff and continental breakfast meats and cheeses. We had no problem communicating in English. Overall, value for money - we paid 95 Euros per night. Oh, and if you are a smoker, Barcelona is heaven. You can smoke everywhere, and even the non-smoking signs on metro platforms are generally ignored. The same goes for this hotel, there is no distinction between smoking and no-smoking rooms.

<Content>Value for money Stayed at this hotel in February 2005. Although it is just a two star hotel I think it would easily pass for a three star. Perhaps it may not quite make a 3-star rating because some rooms were very small and lighting not very good, but our room was clean and comfortable. The hotel rates were very reasonably and it is situated only 5 minutes from La Ramblas and perfect for sightseeing. It is in a very quiet location but we did find that noise from within the hotel from neighbouring rooms does carry 鈥?we had some rather noisy English women in the room next door late one night!. The bathroom again was small but adequate (and it did have a hairdryer). Breakfast were taken in a conservatory and were adequate but not very exciting. The staff were very friendly and helpful. As we did not have a car I cannot say anything about the parking arrangements but I do believe they have parking facilities. Althought the hotel seems to be in a bit of a seedy area we did not feel threatened walking around the area in the evenings. All in all, I felt this hotel was value for money and very well placed for seeing the city on foot.

<Content>good if you can get your room! I was looking for an affordable accommodation in this city for a non-carnival February weekend and it was very difficult. Thus, this hotel priced at around 鈧?10/night for a double with breakfast and taxes included seemed about right. The location is great for walking all around town, is very central and only a 5-10 minute walk from major sites (barrio gotico, mercat de la boqueria, las ramblas, passeig de gracia, contemporary art museums, etc), metro stops (plaza catalunya, universidad) and the airport bus.The room experience at the hotel was fine. My husband and I had a double bed in a room on the fifth floor with a lovely terrace overlooking the northern part of the city and Tibidao. The room was small but clean and simply decorated with painted furniture, a small TV with cable channels and a few small rugs. The bathroom was very small but had a hairdryer and basic amenities. However, I was less than pleased with the service. Although I had confirmed directly with our hotel (given booking via laterooms) our late arrival (midnight), when we arrived, our room was not available and no other rooms were available. The staff said there had been a health emergency with the previous guests and could not give us our room. Yet, they had not attempted to contact me (and they had my phone number) in the 24 hours since the 'emergency' had occurred to let us plan for another option. While I reocgnize that this was exceptional, they did nothing to make my stay better for the obvious inconvenience they caused me and myhusband in our three-night stay there (they did remove 20% of 2 nights, which seemed irrelevant given the moving around, losing sleep and tourism time, etc.)At about 12:30am, they sent us to one of their sister hotels for one night (a three-star) promising us our room the following morning (which did happen). The room that we received in the Husa Oriente was horrible 鈥?it felt like a hostel and was less than standard especially for a 3-star - there was no hot water (they accused me of lying when I mentioned this at the lobby), we had to argue to get the same rate and the included breakfast, there was only an electric heater (which was insufficient for the tiled room floor), the window was onto a shaft and the floor was very dirty. Moreover, the service there was ridiculously rude and self-important. They room we received was not part of the renovated rooms and we were told that we were lucky (at 1am) to have this room at a reduced rate! As such, we were not able to have dinner (food options are super limited post 1am, even though bars are plentiful) and the staff person shrugged and said we were out of luck basically.Was it not for this first-night experience, I would have recommended the Meson Castilla as an affordable option with a bed-and-breakfast style (that approaches 3 stars in Europe). Also, I think if I had not spoken Spanish fluently, I might have received even worse service in both hotels.

<Content>Charming atmosphere! Three of us shared a triple room in early January. Though the street the Meson Castilla is on is a little sketchy, it is very close to where the action is so I felt fine there during the daytime. The hotel itself is very charming - sort of felt like we'd stepped back in time. The staff was friendly and helpful but not overbearing, the rooms were spotless and the breakfast was very enjoyable. It's located just a minute from Las Ramblas which was very convenient. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will stay here again when I am in Barcelona.

<Content>Excellent Great location, lovely building and good value. It has great character and is such a wonderful spot. Excellent for all sightseeing or just wandering around. Wonderful breakfasts in a large airy room. We found a number of lovely places to eat and drink locally, all at bargain prices. As another visitor has said, it is in a cool area and we found the whole area very safe. Obviously as in any city you have to be careful of pickpockets but we had no problem at all, probably as a result of having lived in London for a number of years! Many of our friends have visited Barcelona and I cant think of anyone who has been robbed. Had a wonderful lunch in the sunshine down on the marina near the Hotel des Arts.

<Content>Perfect for a short break For the price, this hotel was perfect for a short break. Although the rooms were fairly basic, it was very clean and perfectly adequate. The breakfast (included in the price) was a little uninspiring, but plentiful and served in a lovely breakfast room.The best thing about it was its location. Very centrally situated, handy for las Ramblas and Place de Catalunya but not noisy. With the exception of one receptionist who was painfully slow, the staff were friendly and helpful.We would certainly recommend this hotel for a short break and would use it again when we revisit this wonderful city.

<Content>Great Value This is my 2nd stay at the Meson Castilla in the past 2 years. Once again I was pleased with the accomadations. The hotel staff was very pleasant and the location is right in the center of town and is a great value for its prime location. The room was very quiet as there are sound proof windows in the room we stayed in. Although the Meson Castilla is not a plush, new hotel, it is very comfortable and clean -- and typical of a European small hotel.

<Content>Great for families! The Meson Castilla was perfect for our family of 4. We had a huge room in the back which was very quiet. We never heard anything from the street or other guests. The room was spotless! The hotel provided an excellent breakfast in a lovely room.We arrived quite early in the day and they allowed us to check in without waiting which was a huge help. The rooms do not have safes but there is a very efficient system at the desk which met our needs. The location of the hotel is in a slightly seedy area, but having said that, we never had a problem. Even walking back after dark, we never felt threatened. This hotel is perfect for families. I did a lot of research and this was one of the few places which could accomdate our entire family in one room for a reasonable price.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Beware of pickpockets in Barcelona I need to begin by warning all travelers about the rampant pick-pocketing in any part of the city where there are tourists. Barcelona has attracted thousands of pennyless, lost, young Europeans (think Cancun spring break) who prey on unsuspecting tourists. Every day we met several people who'd been robbed, some more than once! I've traveled extensively and have never seen a city with a bigger problem of petty theft. The moment you arrive, lock your passport, air tix, credit cards, and wallet in the hotel safe. Carry only some cash you can afford to lose, and your ATM card in a zipped or shirt pocket. These thieves are ingenius and work in teams. Even when people felt their wallet being pulled, they could not determine who did it or the person vanished so quickly there is no chance of apprehension. When they see a taxi being loaded or unloaded they stand nearby and snatch a bag and run. The police know the have a big problem. You see police everywhere stopping shabby young men and having them empty their pockets on the street. The worst areas for thieves were the Ramblas and the Magic Fountain in the evening. Now, we were satisfied with Meson Castilla. The street one uses to access the Ramblas is sketchy, full of tatoo parlors and punk rock cd shops. But the hotel itself is clean and if you ask for an interior room very quiet. Just up the street is a wonderful little restaurant for Catalonian food, Calle Maria - ask the hotel desk for directions. We were not robbed, but will not return to Barcelona again.

<Content>OK but definitely overpriced On the plus side, the location was excellent (2 mins from Las Ramblas), the staff were friendly and the bathroom was very clean. However, I expected more for the amount that I paid since the room was tiny and dull, there was no safety deposit box, and the sheets were not changed during the four nights we stayed there. In the morning we were woken up by people walking upstairs! Generally the hotels in the centre are expensive during this period, and so next time I visit, I'm renting an apartment.

<Content>Wow! The most unique and delightful 2 star hotel I have ever stayed at. This older hotel, with its Catalan decor and furnishings, could be a tour group destination. Bring your camera!! Superb central location, friendly owner and staff. Very clean. The breakfast, which is included, has a wide variety of local and international favourites. We used the hotel twice for pre-cruise and post-cruise stopovers paying 131 Euros per night including all taxes. An overnight stay at this funky little hotel should be on your list of things to do before I die.

<Content>Good, but noisy Small clean hotel with wonderful breakfast room (breakfast average, but dining room lovely). We found our room very noisy, not only from being on the street side (request a room in the back side of the building), but because the walls/floors must be made of cardboard. You could hear the elevators, the guests in the room next door, etc. Also didn't like the fact that the reception desk pushed one of those tourist bus tours that was clearly the poor stepchild of the better-run Bus Tur?stica. We were always waiting for our bus while 3 Bus Tur?stica buses went by. Good location a couple blocks off La Rambla and very close to Place Catalunya.

<Content>We'll be back! This was our first trip to Catalonia, so maybe the Meson Castilla isn't unique. The furnishings and d脙漏cor are beautiful and interesting, and each room has its own handpainted furniture. Everything glistens from the marble floors to the brilliant white bathrooms.An excellent feature is the sitting rooms on each floor, so - if one of you is wide awake and the other asleep - the awake one can withdraw with a book.It's perfectly placed, and an easy walk from most of the main attractions.Because the hotel is family-run, everyone is involved in making sure you have what you need; and, when our ordered taxi didn't arrive because of a strike, the owner drove us to the airport himself. What more could one ask for?Next time, we'll book a room with a terrace.
