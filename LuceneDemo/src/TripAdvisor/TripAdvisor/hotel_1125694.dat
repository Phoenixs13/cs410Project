It麓s located in an emblematic area, in front of Port Vell and near the Borne Area, plenty of fashinable shops, violin makers, designers...a splendid atmosphere! The decoration is fascinating, very sunny and spacious (capacity for 4people). I really recommend this apartment for your stay in Barcelona. It麓s fantastic to enjoy of a comfortable holidays in the city!
