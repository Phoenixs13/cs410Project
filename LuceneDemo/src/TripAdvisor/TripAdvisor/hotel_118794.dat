<Content>Now I know what crystal meth smells like Quite possibly the worst motel I've ever seen. Cinder-block walls, no telephone, burned carpet, c. Not only is the place cash-only, you also have to sign a waiver promising that you will not take illegal drugs. We stayed only for the novelty of sleeping in a crack-motel (makes for great stories). Avoid this motel (unless you want to tell some crazy stories about late-night police raids. seriously.)
