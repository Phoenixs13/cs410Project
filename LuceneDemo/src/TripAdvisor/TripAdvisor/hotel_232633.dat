<Content>Pleasant Surprise I booked the hotel over hrs dot com and got a very good rate (58 Euro) compared to other hotel websites (65 Euro and up) I looked at.The hotel is close to the central train station, probably 5 minutes to walk. The room was clean, the bed was clean, the bathroom was clean, everything was in a good condition. 1 free bottle of water and a delicious breakfast buffet (included in the price) with organic yogurt, cheese and sandwich meat.The environment is okay, across the hotel is a police station. It wasn't very noisy, I haven't had any problems to sleep. To be on the save side, I recommend to get a room on one of the upper floors.My result: I liked the hotel and I would always stay there again.

<Content>A Nice Break, very clean! My daughter and I arrived at the Hauptbahnhof in Frankfurt and were checked into a creepy hostel. We checked right back out. We went back to the Hauptbahnhof and asked if there were any other more suitable accomodations nearby. We were directed a block of so away to the Hotel Cristall.It is a small hotel with a friendly staff. Our room was clean, and we were just far enough away from the Hauptbahnhof to not be disturbed by rail noise. They were redoing carpets and apologized.We were delighted by their breakfast set up. The tables all had linens, and there were many things to choose from.If you want a decent clean friendly place to stay right across from the Hauptbahnhof...on a budget..enjoy
