<Content>nice hotel I had a double room and it was great, it even had a fridge. I paid $65 per night and it included free parking and continental breakfast. Its located downtown and Mayaguez is a nice town. Oh and they recommended a nice seafood restaurant called Jarama Seafood and Steakhouse, it was great.

<Content>pleasant stay Hotel Colonial is located right off the main square in downtown Mayaguez. It's a traditional older hotel which has been somewhat modernized over the decades. Its location is excellent, with restaurants and shops all around, even a local club with salsa, bachata (weekends) on the square. The staff is very accommodating and pleasant. The room I had was really tiny with the sink in the main room but it was functional. There is free secured parking in the back of the hotel. You will be shocked awake by cars blasting reggaeton at all hours of the night as they pass by. It has a litlte continental breakfast in the room off the lobby, but there are other places to breakfast within 2 blocks. All in all, given the price, it was fine. You feel welcome there.
