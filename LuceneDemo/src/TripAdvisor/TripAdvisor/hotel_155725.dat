<Content>Worth The Money This hotel exceeded my expectations. After reading some of the negative reviews I was expecting the Bates Motel. The room was clean and comfortable and had amenities such as an in-room safe, iron, cable TV, and an air conditioner (a window unit that did a good job cooling the room). The staff was cordial and helpful. The location is perfect, with interesting and lively restaurants nearby. It's a good deal for what you pay. I do not understand the negative comments about the quality of this hotel. If you expect a five-star hotel, then by all means pay $300 a night and stay at the Nikko or the W.

<Content>If you can, shop around - otherwise not too bad Not too bad for a $60 last-minute booking -- the location is pretty good (on a street with various apparently good restaurants), and you can walk to the zocolo in 20-30 minutes (or take a cab). Nevertheless, I would advise you shop around -- I am sure you could get something better. Bathroom was pretty nice with lots of hot water, but the room overall was a bit shabby and breakfast very slow.

<Content>Bad Dirty Nasty Real bad hotel. Spend the extra 10$ for a good hotel. We checked out and checked into a random hotel nearby named maya land. For 46$ (after bargening) we got a clean hotel in a good location. The staff at the new hotel were very good.

<Content>A pillow that kills and a hotel that serves not its purpose Greetings, I have traveled to many destinations in Mexico and stayed in many bohemia settings, with very nice cherry wood lobbies and the scent of their reception that fills oneself with tranquility. However, having said that the moment we stepped out of the taxi and looked at the doors we knew right their and then that it did not reflect what we saw in the internet. The hotel represented pictures that are obsolete, they show the Statue of Mexico Independence 鈥渇rom a guest room balcony鈥?which is entirely false. Their in front of the hotel sits in its view a 40 story building! The beds sheets are so worn-down that they are almost transparent. The bed is as hard as the floor. When we got back home we went directly to the chiropractor for back adjustments. Their shower would overflow in matter of 5 minuets. When cleaning is concern, they do not respect the do not disturb sign and even if they do clean, they would not leave enough towels, bottle of water or glass to drink in. Every time we would call in for service (food, towels, etc..) a wait of 1 hour would pass and often I would need to head down to reception and asked them again to send me what I ordered. I must say the employees were nice, just a lack of training on service. Last but not least, the day we were checking out that reception informed us that they had two luxury floors with exquisite rooms, we went to see them and they match close to a tier 1 almost 2 star hotel. So their perspective is small as to the understanding of luxury. Never again will we stay their as we wanted to leave they informed us that they would not return our prepaid rooms. So, so much for a peaceful vacation鈥?/p>

<Content>very disappointed I usually stay at this hotel when I go to Mexico City. But. on this trip I found the hotel staff to be a little rude. The incidents were as follows. Friend called one evening and was told that I wasn't there when I was actually in the room waiting for his call. I don't know why she told him that the call was returned to her. Anyway, due to this error, I missed a very important breakfast the next morning. When I checked into the hotel, I asked for two keys to the room and explained to them and introduced them to the person who would be coming for me everyday and told them that the key was that he wouldn't have to wait and come up immediatly when he arrived. Needless to say, he was interrogated by the front desk staff and made to wait anyway. I was quite firm with them when I found out and from there on in, recieved very poor treatment from them. Upon leaving, due to my own error, I failed to check my bill carefully and realized they had charged me for 2 meals at the restaurant that I never ate. I never even visited the restaurant. So, make sure you check your bill carefully before you pay!. I plan to look for new accomodations for my next rip to Mexico City. I can no longer reccomend this hotel to you. The hotel staff ruined the whole stay for me.

<Content>Hotel del Angel DON'T EVEN This hotel, while located right near the famous Angel monument, is old, dilapidated and service is poor. First, I got this hotel in a package deal, the same package is found on Site 59, Travelocity and AOL Travel. The room I was given had a balcony to which the sliding glass door did not even lock, one could step right over from the next room's balcony and enter your room easily.Second, the staff is not honest about the un-sealed glass bottles of water that have red caps, that are provided by the hotel in the bathrooms. They claim they contain potable water and can be used for drinking, brushing teeth etc, no restrictions. I became ill twice from this water, discounting that it could be the source of my illness the first time because the front desk staff assured me it was safe. The second time, I became very ill and on top of it, was due to check out in the morning. There are no alarm clocks so I spoke face-to-face with the front desk help to get a wake up call at 6:45am in order to get to the airport for my return flight to the US. I watched the front desk man write 6:45am so I know it had been done. At almost 8am I was awakened by the sun entering my room and called the front desk about my wake up call. They had changed shifts and claimed to know nothing about it. Not only very sick with Montezuma's revenge and now worried about missing my flight, I was furious. This was the worst travelling experience of my entire life.

<Content>If you have nowhere else to go... The hotel shows three star rating in most pages that sell it and I wonder who and why they are getting this rating. The place is old, not very well kept and even if the housekeeping staff tries hard it doesn't matter because furniture and carpets are too stained to show any success in cleaning.Room Service is not that good, food is okay, but you have to have time to send food once or twice so they can get the correct order.The staff seems nice, but do nothing to rectify any problems brought to their attention. I know some people will think is a language barrier, however, please know I am Spanish so I am very fluent in the language.If you have no other choice I guess you have no other choice, but to me, this hotel is no star and prices way to high for what they have to offer. By the way, I will gladdly recomend the Gran Melia hotel, is a great value.

<Content>Reasonable The Del Angel is a perfectly acceptable high-rise just couple of blocks north of the Independence Monument (El Angel) on the Paseo de la Reforma. Rooms are not large, but clean and comfortable.

<Content>It was all good We visited Mexico City the first week of April and were so impressed with the location of this hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean and the staff was friendly. The restaurant staff were very nice but after a couple of breakfasts there we ventured out - there are so many wonderful places to eat in the area - right next door in the Hotel Suites Del Angel which has a sidewalk eating area that is so enjoyable. The streets are quaint and tree lined and make dining al fresco a delight. Also there is a Sanborns very closeby (they are on every corner). The Zona Rosa is so close and has many good restaurants. We used hotel taxis and also street taxis. Some of the hotel taxi drivers made us offers to take us to the pyramids and Basilica and we took them up on their offers and had very enjoyable day trips without hassle. The hotel is very close to so many museums that it is very easy to see the city. Strolling on the Paseo de la Reforma is a delight and while you can no longer see the Angel monument from the hotel it is just right there and worth crossing the street to visit and see the spectacular views. The hotel staff was very friendly, everyone from the doormen to the maids were gracious and hospitable. The only challange was the air conditioning - my husband had to call every morning to have it turned on, which they did gladly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as it is so reasonably priced, clean, and the location is superb.

<Content>Cheap Thrill, No frills Our trip to Mexico City and stay at Hotel del Angel took place Feb 23-28th. Our plan was to get a cheap hotel that was convenient to shops, restaurants and tourist sites. We weren't expecting any luxury as expected, but were impressed with the prompt cleaning service, maid service, basic ammenities, and very friendly staff. Just take heed of the hotel clerk; he wasn't much help advising us where to go, or how to get around, but don't worry, the staff/doormen take care of that. Make sure you use the red tour bus obtainable a block away that charges a one time fee, and it takes you to all the museums/city sites; you can hop off and get back on that same day as you wish. Next visit the Castle of Chapultepec--a MUST SEE. The anthropology museum was nice, the pyramids of the sun/moon very impressive, and the National folklore dancers are a must see at the Bellas artes theatre. Be wary of taxis. We used private ones the whole trip...pricey but safe. Taxi fare from airport to hotels should only be 15-$20, no more. Enjoy the stay, the food, the tourist venues and visit Taxco if possible for cheap silver jewelry. We will visit again soon...note to travelers...the much bragged about view of the hotel del angel is gone, they are building a huge beast hotel next door that SHADOWS the view!!!Ciao,Chicago travelers.

<Content>Not bad The hotel is in a good location, close to metro, the major park of the city, and Zona Rosa. The facility was good for the price and rooms were clean. We stayed in this hotel in early September, 2003.

<Content>It's a fine fall back if you're really stranded I've stayed here a few times. I feel safe in the rooms. The street is dark and a little sketchy after dark. The common areas are more than a little drab. The shower knob may occasionally fall off and hit you in the chest with a gushing spray of water and you might get stuck in the elevator between floors, and certainly don't expect the indifferent staff to care too much; in fact, consider it a miracle if you can get as much as a smile out of them when you come and go. Also, life is way too short to waste even one meal at the mediocre restaurant. Having said all that, if you need a room for $50, this place -- which somehow keeps functioning year after year after year - always seems to have rooms available, and it's in a good location.

<Content>What a great find!!! We stayed ther for two nights on Sept. 25  26. Great price, service, clean updated room w/ king bed, view of the Angel glorieta from our room, super close to the double decker tour bus stop, and a hop skip and a jump from the Zona Rosa. We will definitely be back again and again to this great hotel, in the middle of a metropolis called Mexico City.

<Content>Burning Hot Water I bought a Deluxe room for 3 nights, that is how they advertise and what I got was my feet burn from that water of they bathtub, I complain to that from desk and all they did was send me some cream for burning skin. Two days later I ask to speak to the Manager and he told me he had to check his insurance to se if he can compensate me. Before I check out that manager was no where to be found and finally he call and told is secretary to told me that I can send him my medical bills and he will take care of then. If you thinking of staying in Del angel Hotel I recommend you to try other Hotel and if you choose to stay there, be very careful with that bath water you may get burn. The manager keep saying that was that way that water was supposed to come out. I think he was trying to make me believe it was my fault I got my feet burn. Iam very disappointed with that management and with that Hotel Del Angel Deluxe.

<Content>Bad Well to start off with the service at the hotel was good, meaning the maids, bell boys and the food place where you eat. But the front desk was not so good. They charge me twice for my room which I had to take care of back in the states. There is nothing in the room but a bar. No wash clothes or anything like that. This was not a good time. I would not recommend anyone to go there at all

<Content>hated Starting out first. The bell boys where great and the food was good. But the rest of it was not so good. My wife and I stay for 5 days and we had to book tour through another hotel newby because they would not take credit cards. And then we ask for a taxi and how much it cost to go to a store they stated that it would cost 120 mexico money. At the end it cost about 100 more dollars. The room was not so good. No wash cloths, Hair Dryers, Irons and thing like that. One thing that they said that they had on the internet was pool and golf course. Yes about 20 miles way from the hotel. At check out they said that we have not paid for the room in which we had with a package deal. I then showed them the hotel the paper work and the voucher that was given by the travel agrent. Then hotel stated that they need money and not a travel vocher. I ask them to call they travel agrent that was in the city of mexico and they said they did not have to. Plus when this started they then called the police and had them standing by. I then descide to give them my credit card but they really did not want that. I then sign my name to the credit card and put on the bill that i disagree with this and they would not take it to. They more or less forced me to sign the credit and leave. That is way you pay with credit card so you can come back and have the company take it off of your bill

<Content>Great location and service Ideal location across the Reforma from the Zona Rosa. Hotel has a great view of the Angel Monument in rooms 5-12 on the upper floors. Rooms 1-4 on each floor face a sunless street. This can be rather cold in the winter months.Rates are very reasonable compared to the pricier and similar properties in the Zona Rosa. Sanborn department store has a 24-hour restaurant. The hotel has a very good little restaurant on the 11th floor. The breakfast buffets are very filling. There is a great view from the restaurant overlooking the Angel Monument. The American Embassy is just two blocks away.The hotel has a slow elevator. The rooms are quite large and well stocked with amenities. The refrigerator-bar in each room is expensive. One can easily find a small store for the basics within a block of the hotel.Staff is very friendly and helpful. I have stayed here many times over the past twenty years and have also brought several groups here.I rate this property excellent for the location, price and service. Dave Parent
