<Content>Couldn't ask for more We spent 3 nights here and were very pleased with everything.Front desk manager extremely helpful. Large room in main building as well as extremely large bathroom and everything cleaned every day. We had a rear room so no noise at all.Best part is it's location on U line 6 (easy in from Tegel airport with a short bus ride to the U-bahn 6 line at first) which crosses U-bahn 2 at the corner. Bus to Potsdamer Platz where one can change to bus to Hauptbahnhof passes the hotel. Easy access to Alexanderplatz by bus or U-bahn and a stone's throw to Check-point Charlie Museum. Oh yes, the breakfast was very good including sausages and eggs as well as cold items and fruit. The hotel is very plain but just perfect for sightseeing. The price of 99euros w/breakfast was really very reasonable.The 72 hour A/B zones travel card makes hopping on all means of transportaion within the city well worth it's purchase including getting in from the airport. Finding the office to buy the card at Tegel was the only challenge! There is so much to see in the new Berlin!

<Content>Excellent staff, great hotel We booked through the Hauptbahnhof infostore on arrival in Berlin and couldn't have been more pleased. The hotel is the former Bulgarian embassy guest quarters and still has wonderful elements of Soviet austerity in its design. We stayed in the suite block at the back of the hotel across a courtyard. The rooms were large, beds comfortable, bathroom spotless and the rate fantastic. You feel like you're staying in a real part of Berlin history. Breakfast was good. More importantly, you couldn't find more helpful staff than those at the Kubrat - incredibly attentive, courteous and thoughtful. The location is fantastic: two minutes walk from Checkpoint Charlie and the Gendarmenmarkt, 15 minutes to the Brandenburg Gate or the Museumsinsel. U-Bahn station Stadtmitte is 1 minute away and takes you to Prenzlauerberg in one direction and Sch枚neberg and Ku-Damm in the other. Bus M48 runs directly outside to Alexanderplatz. There are good upmarket restaurants in the Gendarmenmarkt and cheaper ones south of Checkpoint Charlie.

<Content>absolutey NOT up to 3-star admittedly, this hotel is well and centrally located, which, however, enables it to provide less due service. two examples, it claims that wlan connection is available in rooms, but i have changed 3 times (testing one after another) to find a room that was within signal coverage, but still very unstable connections. so if you plan to carry ur laptop here, please find another hotel or find a internet cafe nearby, second disappointment, this hotel shockingly doesnt offer laundry service. when i carried a bag of shirts down to the reception asking where should i leave them, the receptionist said, there is a laundry around the corner, please do it youeself and we dont have laundry. i couldnt believe it, 3 stars without laundry?!! breakfast is ok, dont expect too much though.generally good location, but if you dont really need that that central location, please find another hotel to spare the troubles.

<Content>Great location  My husband and I and our 25-year-old son have just returned from a two-week stay at Hotel Kubrat. We were favourably impressed, and at 135 Euros a night it was excellent value. We had a 2-bedroom apartment in a separate building behind the main building and through a parking lot. The building was older, but perfectly clean and well kept. The apartment had IKEA-type furnishings. There were 2 bathrooms, one with just a toilet and sink, the other with a toilet, sink and bathtub with a hand-held shower, which we found a bit awkward. There was a large living room and a balcony. There was also a mini-bar fridge stocked with beer, water, wine, etc. that were reasonably priced, and the fridge was also large enough to hold items we purchased elsewhere.The included breakfast buffet was very good. The restaurant staff were always pleasant and smiling, as were the front desk staff. We found their English to be somewhat limited, but adequate (this is Germany after all!). We also appreciated the free internet in the stairway off the main lobby, and the fact that we could buy transit passes at the front desk and just charge it to our bill.The location was excellent, just steps from the Stadtmitte U-bahn station and within close walking distance of lots of restaurants and shopping. It was also within reasonable walking distance of many sites, including Museuminsel and Potsdamer Platz.The only inconvenience with this hotel was the fact that they would only give us one key for the apartment, and with 3 adults, we were not always coming and going at the same time. However, this problem was manageable with some advance planning.

<Content>Great appartment - perfect location Our family of three adults stayed at Kubrat for two nights in august 07. We made our reservation through the tourist information office at the Brandenburg Gate.We got appartment no 6 in a building just through the backyard parking place (鈧?6/day). The appartment was huge - two big bedrooms, a large livingroom with a nice balcony, a bathroom with toilet, and another separate wc, and a kitchen with fridge and a sink. Though the appartment could need some new carpeting and some paintwork, it was perfect for our stay.The location is great. Approx. 50 m from Checkpoint Charlie, and with Potsdamer Platz, Unter den Linden, Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag within a distance of 800 m, the Kubrat Hotel is the perfect starting point for a Berlin experience.The staff was very nice and polite, and we got warm smiles from both the reception staff and the lovely breakfast-fraulein. Not all of them are very good in English, but with a little German and a little English, it's OK. Breakfast is also OK, but could be better. All in all, though, the Kubrat Hotel is great value.

<Content>Great Location I found this hotel through tripadvisor and was very pleased with my stay. Not enough can be said about the helpful staff at the front desk. At the end of my stay, they even called ahead to my next hotel to be sure that my reservation was confirmed.The location cannot be beat. You are within walking distance to all the sights and museums.The hotel does need to replace worn towels, sheets, bedspreads, and carpeting. It would make a difference in its appearance.While in Berlin I took 4 of the Original Insider Tours. They were superb and gave you great value for your dollar. You can find brochures for the tours in this hotel's lobby.

<Content>A pleasant stay at the Hotel Kubrat This hotel equipped with an elevator is located conveniently near the Potsdamer Platz train station. Though it is located along a busy street, our large, clean room in contrast was very quiet. English-speaking staff members were pleasant and helpful. The continental breakfast was great, and an adjacent Italian restaurant served good food. The hotel provided free use of the Internet on a computer outside the lobby. The Checkpoint Charlie Museum, Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag and Holocaust Memorial are within walking distance.

<Content>Good Value in the Heart of Berlin Hotel Kubrat Berlin Mitte was a pleasant surprise. The rooms are spacious, well kept, and comfortable. You are within walking distance of some nice restaurants and Check Point Charlie, plus the subway is just around the corner. The breakfast buffet was a delicious standard European fair within a nice atrium overlooking the street. The staff was courteous and helpful. Beds were a bit hard and the free internet a bit slow. But overall it is a good value in the heart of Berlin. I would stay there again.

<Content>Consider Hotel Kubrat My wife and I spent seven days at the Hotel Kubrat and were very satisfied. The room was large and comfortable. The shower was in one room, the toilet and sink in another. Both of these rooms were separated by a door from the rest of the room where the beds and a sitting area were located. Even though our room faced busy Leipziger Strasse, the street noise seldom bothered us. The included breakfast was varied, although it never changed from day to day. The reception desk was staffed 24 hours a day, and they were very courteous. Since their English was far better than my limited German, we never had problems communicating. In spite of the fact that the other hotel guests were German, we always felt like we fit in with the crowd. The location, near the Stadtmitte U-bahn, was very convenient and within walking distance of the Gendarmenmarkt area. The next cross street from the hotel is Friedrichstrasse whose shopping opportunities reminded us of Michigan Ave. in Chicago.

<Content>clean, big rooms I had been in this hotel for one night for business purpose. The receptionist was very polite and first paid for us the taxi driver fee, since we didn't have small money. The room was very big and so is the bathroom (its has only shower, and no bath tub). The room was very clean and quiet. Breakfast was fine, though the milk was a bit sour.The location is also very good and near a U train station.
