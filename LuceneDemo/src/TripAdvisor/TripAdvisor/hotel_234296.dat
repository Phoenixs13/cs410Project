<Content>A very good choice The best thing of this apart / hotel is its location. It is just off, Diego de Leon, one of the prime streets in Madrid. A very safe central location full of restaurants bars supermarkets and shops. It is also very close to a tube stop with access to lines 6 and 4.The appartments are well appointed. They are spacious and nicely furnished. I went for the smallest one and it had two large single beds, a desk, a small dining table wih two chairs and a sofa. The kitchen is well equiped but I've seen better. One of the main problems with the kitchen is that they don't provide washing up services, but they don't supply washing up liquid or a sponge to wash the dishes with or a space or cloth to dry them either so you have to either live with the dirty dishes or buy those items yourself, which is not always convenient.The bathroom suite are new and modern although my bed was a bit squeeky and the taps in the bathroom could do with a change.I've read previous comments about their reception staff. I found them to be fairly pleasant, nobody was rude to me, although I'm a local so maybe I'm a bit better at understanding the local culture. People in Madrid can be a bit arrogant some times, but it's not a particularity of QuoEraso's reception staff but rather a Madrid people's trait.The area is very quiet but the hotel isn't. There is this background music being placed in all corridors and you can hear it from the rooms. Very annoying. Another thing to take into consideration is that this type of place is often used by families with young babies because of the kitchen facilies, and children are loud, so be prepared to be woken up in the middle of the night by some screaming baby or to have the children in the room upstaris running up and down at 7 in the morning.The only thing that quite annoyed me about this place was the cost of making a phone call: 4.70 Euros for 3 minutes!!! use your mobile, even if you are on roaming, it's likely to be a lot cheaper.All in all, and considering that I paid 60 Euros per night for this place I think it was one of the best value places I've been at. Excellent location and good accomodation. Recommended but bring earplugs if you are light sleeper.

<Content>unfriendly reception my daughter and I stayed at this hotel for a few nights in April,we loved the hotel the room was spacious and clean and the location was great close to metro exit.Unfortunatly our stay was tainted by the sour faced and unfriendly receptionist ( female) altough we speak fluent Spanish she could not be bothered to look at us or greet us or even acknowledge our existence.What a shame this lovely hotel is being spoilt by this unpleasent welcome.Management please take note that unfortunatly the staff at this hotel will stop us staying here again or recommending it to friends.

<Content>Nice place but VERY rude staff Nice, clean rooms in fairly central part of Madrid. However, one of the female receptionists was incredibly rude, giving us filthy looks every time we came in and out of the hotel yet canoodling with a man in full view at other times.Nice place for a short break, just please sack this horrible woman!!!!!

<Content>Not bad at all My daughter and I stayed 3 days in Quo Eraso at the end of September and we experienced our stay as good value for money. O.k. the reception was small and only one person behind the desk. We arrived at 13:00 p.m. and as our room was not ready they asked us to come back in half an hour. We went for a cappuccino next door and when we returned our room was ready. The room was spacious and clean. No dirty carpets at all as the previous reviewer mentioned. Bathroom was o.k. as well. The only thing we did not like is that the Kitchen was locked. I had to go downstairs again where I was told that I had to pay Euro 20 deposit to use the kitchen utensils! Why did they not tell us when we checked in? And as they had my creditcard details, they were taking no risk of losing knives or forkes! Location was perfect. Less than a few hundred meters from the Underground. We (two women) did not feel uncomfortable at night at all and walking at midnight from the underground to our hotel was no problem and felt safe.There are some supermarkets a few minutes from the hotel and where you can buy very cheaply all you can think off. We did not use their breakfast service but had breakfast once in our appartment and twice next door.

<Content>Spacious, quiet, clean We booked this hotel because it was near the folks we were visiting. It is located a few metro stops away from the main tourist action, but we found the neighborhood to be safe, quiet at night, and entertaining during the day. Our room was a triple, with a fold out couch that could sleep two children. It was very large, especially as European rooms go, with a luxurious bath area. The kitchen supplies were barely adequate, but we only wanted to prepare snacks anyway. Everything was spotless and new. The desk staff was not overly friendly, but they spoke some English and were helpful when needed.On the negative side, it is true that the hall lights are out unless turned on by you when you pass through, and they do play awful music in the halls.

<Content>Rudest staff ever! Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for one night when we realised we had underbooked in our initial hostel. They were lovely on the phone, but when we got there they were beyond rude and uninterested. The room was good, well-equipped and clean, and its just beside the metro, but the staff and constant piped music in the corridors and lifts mean that we won麓t be staying there again!

<Content>Lovely stay in Madrid Having read some reviews, we were increasingly apprehensive leading up to our stay at the hotel, but were delighted upon arrival to find that our room was clean and quite luxurious.The staff were really friendly and helpful. We stayed over a week and wanted to get the most out of it so we really appreciated the steer in the right direction and their advice.Though we didn't cook a huge amount (mainly because dining in Madrid is comparatively cheap), there were a couple of nearby supermarkets and we must admit a couple of trips to local fast food joints.The staff left us alone when we put up the Do not Disturb sign but remembered to give us new towels later in the day which was kind of them. The staff stored our luggage on our last day which was helpful as our flight wasn't until the evening.The area was fine - there was the occasional traffic noise but overall was quite quiet.I would definitely recommend the hotel if you are looking for somewhere close to the metro station, are looking for a more cost effective solution, but would like to have some comfort on your travels.

<Content>Hated the Eraso Hotel Staying at the Quo Eraso hotel is one of the worst experiences I have ever experienced in my entire life. Not only the staff was most unhelpful but also the facilities were horrendous.I stayed there for two weeks in order to visit the capital and truly speaking I just really wanted to get out of that pigsty.The hotel itself is very old and extremely bleak. The corridors were also not only extremely dark but also so narrow that it was impossible for two people to walk along the corridor one next to the other. The room was rather thin, specially its bathroom with hardly any space to place the shaving razor and my deodorant. The kitchen facilities were also dirty and old, so truly speaking I had not the guts to prepare myself a meal there and it had an awful smell of cooking oil that was all over the place.The room had stains all over the floor and the walls, and it was so dirty that I had to raise a formal complain to the hotel, what lead to nothing, as they did not offered me to change my room鈥︹€︹€?br/>I can鈥檛 understand why the charge so much for each room since as I see it this is an utter rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!Next time I will visit Madrid, I will look for a newer hotel with much more facilities, such a good room service, bigger rooms and spotlessly clean hotel with maybe a swimming pool and a gym. I know that this is not something essential but in my humble opinion, as I keen traveler that I consider myself, I am sure that much more maybe offered considering the prices that they charge.Appart from that, the hotel is not in a good and safe area鈥︹€ got stolen once during a stroll along the area鈥︹€︹€nd I realized, the area around the hotel is full of houses crammed with Latinos which are not only quite noisy (organizing parties with music at 02:00 a.m.) but also a violent and uproarious bunch of people.All in all, Madrid is a big and marvelous city with a lot of things to see and do, so I would deeply recommend you to look for another hotel, as there must be a newer, more equipped, with better facilities and services in a safer place of the city, with more services, e.g. restaurants, museums, bars, shops,鈥︹€︹€round it.

<Content>Don't stay here! There was a problem with another hotel so they booked us here. it was horrible. the lobby was dark and there is only one man behind the counter. when he took us up to see our rooms he had to lock up the whole reception desk. scary!the rooms were bleak and really quite old. the section of the area eraso is near the bullfights and is quite dodgy. it did not look safe enough to go outside. the corridors were dark and had auto shut-off lights. plus noisy neighbors were in the two floors that my family occupied! scary!do not stay here! it is nothing like the quo puerta del sol which is a much newer, much more modern hotel.

<Content>Great base for discovering madrid Stayed in the Eraso a number of times visiting Madrid. Great facilities, spotlessly clean, quiet, with plenty of eateries nearby. Good links to public transport or just a 20 minute walk into central madrid through the interesting Salamanca district.
