<Content>Knock first The hotel used to be top class, but is a bit worn with age. Music is nice. Food is good. Location: convenient to south perimeter, metro, and a small shopping area with grocery and restaurant. They have plenty of hot water for showers, and various services and amenities you would expect from a 4 star hotel.Biggest problem, I checked at 11 pm with a colleague. We were assigned two rooms and found they were both already occupied. We went back to the desk and got two more keys. One of the rooms was vacant, the other was occupied. So, I was upgraded to a nice room with jacuzzi, which I traded with my colleague because his room was dark, dingy and uninviting.Second night a bellman knocked at 10 pm. I answered. He said he was just checking to see if the room was occupied. At 11 pm a couple who had been assigned to my room were trying to enter with their key. The WiFi worked best in or near the back of the lobby, and then not all the time. There was a business center. I was able to connect my laptop by cable there.It was December and the lobby was rather cool. There are no thermostats in the room. You need a bellman to adjust the temperature.There are not many decent hotels on the south side, so this is actually one of the better ones in the area. If you are going to stay there, bring a sweater, bring a cable for you laptop, use the safe, lock your door at night, and knock before entering your room.

<Content>Average Average hotel far south of the city. Mainly business. On a main road, near to the trolley bus and there is a supermarket and restaurant across the way, but crossing the road is very very dangerous, be careful. Staff are okay, but absolutely no English. f you need to travel from the hotel take a taxi outside from one of the doorman,arrange a price first. Don't take the green/white taxis, too risky.
