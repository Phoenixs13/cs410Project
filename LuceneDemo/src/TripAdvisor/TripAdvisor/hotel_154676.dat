<Content>Good rates but issues We were looking for cheap hotels and got a recommendation from a friend to stay here because it's relatively centrally located in Mexico City for first time visitors wanting to check out historic sites and hip neighborhoods.Rooms are pretty modest but we weren't planning on watching TV all day so that wasn't an issue. $50 for a bed, shower and TV isn't bad. They have lockboxes at lobby desk for passports, etc. There was some construction going on in neighborhood and street nearby was pretty noisy at night- loud enough that I was happy I brought along earplugs. If you're a light sleeper looking for pampering/luxury- this isn't the place for you. I live in NYC so wasn't freaked out by neighborhood, but one of those transitional areas where at night felt a bit desolate at times walking around. You're a 10 minute cab ride from all this historic stuff downtown and cool neighborhoods like Condessa and Roma.There are alot bigger chain hotels with subpar restaurants in area, but if you walk around neighborhood there are quite a few good hole in the wall mom and pop places to eat breakfast/lunch for $5/person- some good homecookin'. Ideal hotel if you don't mind noise, aren't freaked out by dark/transitional neighborhoods at night, and looking for a reasonable place to stay that's 10 min cab ride to touristy spots.

<Content>Prim is perfect for the price Three of us stayed overnight at the Prim Hotel prior to our flight home to Toronto. We reserved online and were welcomed cordially on arrival and shown to a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms! which was very convenient. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful when we needed help. The area was middle-class residential and we were able to walk to the Zocalo and back. To be picky - the TV was scratchy, the view from the windows was other windows across the roof, and we were disappointed at the instant coffee for breakfast.But for the price, it was entirely satisfactory. Recommended for budget-minded people more interested in sightseeing than luxury accommodations.Signed: Sandra, Chris and Nola in Toronto, Canada

<Content>It was good - We would stay again to save $$$ We stayed here for about 3-4 nights in March 06. We paid VERY little for this hotel which was good. LOCATION: The hotel is in a decent location. It鈥檚 about a 5 minute walk to the main street (zona de something). We were also a 5 minute walk from the hop on hop off bus for Mexico City. It鈥檚 very close to a number of corner stores and little restaurants which was good. Major tour companies do pick up at this hotel.ROOMS: Think of a college dorm room. It was very small with an old bed, a TV which does not need a remote since all you have to do is reach over to change the channels (the room was that small), a built in desk, closet, and a fairly spacious bathroom with nice old tile work.The room had no A.C. Thank God it was nice and cool when we were there. Our window was facing the inside of the courtyard so we got a little breeze. Doors are thin and only have one lock which may not be secure for some. We just put the chair in front of it at night. Maid service was good as we tipped daily. The room was clean but the bed spread looked a little worn with two small measly pillows. The shower pressure and temperature was great!This hotel services many people - from large sports team, nightly visitors, partiers, tourists, and everything in between. SERVICE: The font desk was nice. I did run into problems at the restaurant for breakfast. I think they were trying to cheat me on paying more. I found someone at the front desk who helped resolved the situation graciously. The front desk called taxis for us when needed and was very helpful. I did not quite expect that level of service for this type of hotelOVERALL: If you鈥檙e going to be out and about ALL day long, I see NOTHING wrong with this hotel. I don't think I would be able to bear it in the middle of summer though with no A.C. This hotel is great for people who don鈥檛 want to spend much on accommodations in Mexico City. We chose this hotel because we wanted to save money for another high end hotel in another city in Mexico. I think it was worth it. I would stay here again with no doubts.

<Content>Not a hotel I would recommend Earlier I had posted on the forum if anyone recommended a hotel with a/c. Believe me you NEED it during this month. I gave into the comments that it gets chilly at night, so I thought I wouldn't need a/c during my stay. Well this is true if you stay in a room that gets a breeze through the window. Otherwise, you will be miserable with no cool air flowing. The hotel did not offer any fans either. I asked repeatedly. I didn't like the way the hotel was laid out. Think of a square. The rooms are lined along in a square shape and hollow in the middle, with the window facing the hollow area. Yes, there is only one window in the room and one in the restroom. Guests from across my hotel room and the floor rooms above could see through my window, which was also directly in front of my bed, so I had to keep my curtain closed. This didn't help with the whole cooling situation. My first impression of the room was...oh no.Many of the guest were young rude kids that stayed up every and all night yelling from outside their windows to other guests at either the same floor level or lower level rooms. During my first night, a Chinese foreigner was up yelling at them for about 30 minutes. I finally was fed up and called the front desk to ask them to stop shouting. They continued on for about another hour whistling, and making vulgar noises.My family came into town to spend some time with me, but I didn't want my them to stay at this hotel and experience what I had on the first night. I put them up at a different hotel that cost $35/night. I was paying $45/night. The second night, everything happened just as the first. I got up around 1a.m. and walked to my parent's hotel to get some sleep. The third and final night I was there, the some of the male guests kept eyeing and following me around. They made me feel unsafe. I waited four hours, before I went into my room because I didn't want them to see what room I was staying in. I couldn't sleep, worring if they had figured out what room I was in. They did knock on my door a few times and called my phone, but I didn't answer either.The hotel offers internet service, but it cost $10 to use. I recommend you take an iron for your clothes, alarm clock, plug adapter for your appliances, and extra toiletries, and fan. These aren't offered by the hotel. The front lobby of the hotel is misleading to what the actual rooms look like. It would have been nice to have marble floors. If you do choose to stay here, the cab ride is only $4.00 from the airport. The taxis at the airport will try to get $40 out of you if you don't purchase a ticket at the booth. The hotel itself offers this service, but it costs $14 each way. It is more economical to take the red and white taxis. That is what I rode in for all my rounds. To the Zona Rosa, I walked. It would have cost less than $1.50 in a taxi.For eating out on Saturdays and Sunday nights, I recommend Wings. They have half price menus after 8:00 p.m. The arrachera steak is excellent and costs $6.98 dollars for a 10oz. I don't know why anyone would pay more than $10 per person to eat in Mexico City, even if it is a buffet. More than that you are getting ripped off.This was the only restaurant I ate at. The other times I ate from stands along the street. Birria (goat meat) stands at La Basilica are excellent and so are the Gorditas. I bought the meat by the kilo to make my own tacos with flour tortillas that are sold at a store down the block. This tortilla store also makes these great jalepeno tortillas and also ones made out of wheat. At La Basilica, I was able to see the Virgen Mary of Guadalupe, but I went at a bad time. I went during the pilgrimage of the entire state of Querretaro. There were thousands and thousands of people there. I went on a Sunday because I read online that the Basilica is closed on Mondays. This is not true. I also went to the Teotihuacan pyramids. There is a museum that closes at 5:30pm on Sundays. Take sunblock, shades, and a hat. You will need them.Xochimilco was awesome. Take a picnic basket and ice chest on the boat and have a party.Be careful of some of the shopping districts in Mexico City; they are not all safe.

<Content>Getting your money's worth For $40 a night in Mexico City, you can go from truly horrific, to actually rather decent. The Prim is not fancy, and rest assured that if it isn't attached to the room, you aren't getting it, but it's adequate. The staff is friendly, the location, in a middle class neighborhood, is relatively safe. The rooms are clean and I found the bed comfortable. Really, if you are looking for a decent place to leave your stuff (as always, leave valuables in the safe deposit box at the desk), rest your head, and wash your body, this hotel is perfectly up to snuff. Spend your money on sight seeing, food, and souvenirs.
