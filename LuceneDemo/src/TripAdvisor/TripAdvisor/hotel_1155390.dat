<Content>OK We stayed at a 2 bedroom villa at Ahimsa estate. My experience was average primarily because:a) The rooms  bathrooms were smelly: I think the drain in both the bathroom wasn't functioning which resulted in a smelly bathroom with smelly rooms.b) Air Conditioning was below average: The split units failed to cool the rooms.On the positive side:a) Interiors: The rooms were well decorated with modern architecture. The bathrooms were nice with large mirrors.b) Staff: The staff was polite and helpful.c) Location: Very well located right next to the famous lounge bar called Ku De Ta.
