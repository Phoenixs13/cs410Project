<Content>Pension 45 - A Grim Hovel If you want a night's sleep in this hotel, make sure to get blind drunk. Otherwise, either the noise in the street will keep you awake, or the owner's dog, barking all night in reception, will do the trick.Don't complain to the proprietor about his dog though, unless you can converse in fluent Spanish. He won't speak a word of English to you, and even the normal courtesies are not high on his agenda. He demanded a euro from me for calling a taxi, which I know is not a lot, but indicates the contempt this establishment has for its customers.If you want a shower, buy your own towel. The handkerchief-sized specimens supplied wouldn't dry a small mouse. Oh, and watch out for the shower head. It's inclined to fall off the wall without warning. Never was the expression dirt cheap more appropriate.Can I think of any positive points?Yes. You can always check out of this hotel and go somewhere decent.

<Content>La cucaracha, la cucaracha... ya no puede caminar! Excellent location! BUT... my nephew stayed in a room infested with cockroaches. They were everywhere... on the floor, on the walls, and even in the closet. The room I stayed in was very very noisy. The balcony doors did not close all the way so you could hear the crowded street right below. The walls were so thin that we could here everything from the reception area to the people in the rooms nearby. The third room we reserved was the best room because it was on the other side of the building and not that many people were in the rooms on that side. This also happened to be the room without the bathroom. Without a doubt, the only reason that people stay at this hostel is because of it's location.

<Content>Not so bad We stayed here for 3 nights,besides the bad reviews we read about this hostel, there was nowhere else to book so cheaper, near the city center and with a private bathroom.Positive aspects: great location(2 minutes from Plaza de Catalunia), price, very quiet (the street is traffic free), the room was clean and the towels changed every day.Negative aspects: the staff is not very friendly and the rooms are only to sleep, there's no tv ou telephone. So, if you want to enjoy the hotel you should probably find somewhere else, but if you only want a nice bed to sleep, in the city center and noise free, this is a good option.

<Content>don't believe the hype! Yes, Pension 45 is cheap, but you get what you pay for!The rooms are tiny, with poor lighting/ furnishing and the odd cockroach! The noise levels are dreadful...building site at the back and noisy revellers at the front! I can't think of a single redeeming feature. I stayed there based on recommendation...a big mistake!

<Content>Not so great I stayed at this hotel due to the positive reviews on this site, however, I was not impressed by this place.The room was really stuffy and at night it was hard to sleep. I don't think there was any A/C available.We were woken up in the middle of the night by the receptionist, who did not speak English and we had no idea what he wanted... or why he woke us up at 5AM !@#@!#Location wise this place is good, close to the Ramblas and placa da Catalunya. However, I'd stay somewhere else the next time I go to Barcelona.

<Content>Horrible!! Avoid At All Cost... This hotel is really bad, not only it's really dirty, the people there are not nice at all...and they try to take advantage of me seeing that I am a women and didn't speak that great spanish...I called them and needing a room for one person, they said they only had vailable a double room which was souble the price...when I got there and was waiting to check in, there was somebody else asking for a single room for a night and they had it...so I try to tell him how come he told me on the phone that there were only double rooms and now, there was a guy just getting there now and the room was available...and he tryed to give me a lame excuse...well...to complete the experience, when I went to pay, he charged more then the price he told me over the phone...I felt horrible I was traveling alone, and from reading some of the reviews here I thought it would be a good, cheap and good location place to stay. I wasn't expecting a nice hotel for the price, but at least that the people there would be honest...Trust me, don't stay on that dumpster...

<Content>the best accomodation in Barcellona? I got it: pension 45 and its staff! I'm an italian girl and I was in Barcellona this summer for the first time with a friend of mine.I arrived in Barcellona just with my baggage and without reservation. I looked for a room and I was in a lot of hostels but finally I chosed one: Pension 45, the best I found in Barcellona!It is located in a strategical place: you can reach rambla in just 2 minutes by walking and plaza catalunya in maybe 3 minutes.The hostel is very clean and at the price of 25euro for person in a double you have included breakfast too (Abdel prepare a wonderful napoletan coff猫!) until 12 in the morning. The most important aspect as regard as the hostel is its staff: the receptionist man is the best of all the world: friendly, fanny, and very serious!I will never forget barcelona, pension 45 and the staff of the pension of course.Thank you A. E.!

<Content>Great Experience! I have nothing but great things to say about Pension 45. The location is great! It is right close to the action on Las Ramblas, but is located on a fairly quiet street. Our room was very clean, and so were the shared bathrooms.The staff was also very friendly.If you want value for your money, this is the place to stay.

<Content>Great location at a good price Pension 45 is located on C. Tallers, 45 in the El Raval section of Barcelona, a longish block away from La Rambla (next to Hosteria Grau). They have 24-hr reception and a mix of small, private double/twin rooms, some with bath and others with a sink. The location is terrific, off the Ramblas so you don't have all the street noise (Tallers is a pedestrian lane), but close enough so you can get to the action in a 5-minute walk. The price is right too: we paid 45 euro for a double with bath, and 27 euro for a single-occupancy twin (they didn't have triples for us). The staff was really nice to us--we arrived too early for our rooms after taking an overnight bus from Bilbao, but they let us take showers in the shared bathrooms. They make you prepay for the night, and speak mostly Spanish (but are really friendly even if you don't). There is free coffee/tea in the TV lounge. The building is kind of old, but with the price as low as it is, not too shabby!
