<Content>Clean and Affordable place Its was great experiance during the chrismas season. The lady and the guy who is in the reception counter is very friendly. And the room we stayed (two of us) cost about Sing $ 70 which is affordable for a budget person who is travelling.The room was clean and had a attached bathroom, wardrobe, dressing table etc etc with aircon room and TV. The place is just few min walking distance to MRT station. Overall this hotel is really a best place to stay over if your looking for a budgeted place.
