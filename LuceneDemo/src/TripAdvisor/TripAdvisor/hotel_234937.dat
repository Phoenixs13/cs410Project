<Content>Good hotel but only for non-summer travel since thers is no AC! Just came back from Berlin this week. This hotel, shockingly, despite calling itself a four-star hotel, did not have air-conditioning!!! I, therefore, would personally not stay in this hotel during the summer when it is warm and humid; however, they do have heaters, so a stay during cold months, like ours, is just fine as far as this issue is concerned. Another MAJOR complaint I would have is the shower doors being only half the length of the bath tub and resulting in a messy wet bathroom floor after every shower. It amazes me to see these kinds of shower doors commonly in Europe,and I just don't know what they are thinking when they build them this way and the reasoning behind it. The third negative is the lack of free-internet access, and not even having a business center, again despite calling themselves 4****. You can borrow a laptop from them and get internet for a considerable fee.To the positives: The best feature of this hotel was its location. Besides being in the middle of Ku'dam, its accessibility from the airport was unbelievable. You can get to the Hotel from TX airport with just one bus (#109) which drops you off right in front of the Hotel and can go back the same way, and it will only cost you 2.1 Euros and take you about 20 minutes!! And the closest metro station is about 3 blocks (salvingiplatz), ie 5 minute walk and you can even walk to the Zoo train station within 15 minutes by foot. And the area is very safe and nice and you walk through shopping areas so the walk goes by quickly. The Room was very clean, but the first time I entered, the hotel did smell somewhat musty (mild) and humid and old. The second time, I could not smell much maybe because my nose had become saturated, but, anyway, it was not bothering us anymore. The furniture is a little old and feels somewhat 70's and 80's, but surprisingly in pretty good shape . They don't have king beds, they put two twin beds next to each other and call it a  standard double!! We stayed at three german hotels during our trip, and they were all this way. The breafast was very good and we pigged out on it every morning so much that we could not eat lunch and it was more like a brunch for us.Overall, by US standards, this is a 3-star hotel and not a four-star one. In the US, we probably would have paid around 150-200 dollars for this kind of accommadations in any US major city in non-peak times in mid-april, but we paid a 150 Euros per night, which given the exchange rate, came to around 250 dollars, so perhaps a little expensive for a 3*** hotel.Overall, however, we had a good stay and I would highly recommend this hotel for a non-summer stay, given the excellent location, the breakfast, and the nice staff, but definitely not when it is warm since there is no AC unless you can sleep in a hot and humid room or are ok with opening windows and don't mind the noise.

<Content>Good Hotel I booked the mondial because of its location, the reviews on this website and the fact that it had a pool. Well, the pool is pretty small, so good for a wake-up splash in the mornings, really. The location is very good, being just by a tube stop on the Ku'Damm and within easy walking distance of good shopping and restaurants in Charlottenburg. The room was enormous, as was the bathroom, and looked out over the Ku'Damm. It was certainly better than average as far as size and comfort were concerned. One major disadvantage for any business traveller is that there is NO WLAN access in the rooms. This is only available in the lobby, so once the receptionist had entered the mac-address of my laptop on their network I was able to access the internet from the lobby. There were no tea  coffee making facilities in the room, so for a late-night coffee, it was necessary to ask for room service. A few times it seemed to me as though some of the staff were not naturally helpful as you might expect them to be in a hotel. That, as well as the non-internet access, was the negative of our stay. I would recommend this hotel, but probably not to business travellers.

<Content>Hotel Mondial superb value! Returned from Hotel Mondial  having read all the reviews of this hotel, will state that is superb.Rooms are a more than generous size , spotlessly clean  in our case overlooking the Kurfurstendamm, where the christmas lights twinkled.The hotel is close to s-bahn station  bus stops for tours.breakfasts (included in the price) are staggering..ample portions to help your self  top quality fruits , cereals , cooked dishes etc.On one occasion the hotel was booked for dinner for a group booking so we went just around the corner where there are IIndian, Spanish  French restaurants.Quite close is the zoo-ological gardens where the christmas markets are (one of I think about 8 altogether)  it is enchanting.To get the best of Berlin, take a bus tour to hop on  off..so much tto see.One trip you can do on your own is the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, just outside the city...harrowing but interesting.Berlin is trying to come to terms with the horror of the nazis  seems to be forever apologising showing so many aspects of the war all over town.One tip, if you stay here get off the s-bahn at Savigny platz on s9 it is quite close.This train runs from the airport which is about 20 miles away  costs just over $2.We paid around 拢75 a night for this hotel,  considered it excellent value for money. Staff Friendly  helpful. The desk clerk even wished us a safe journey home. Highly recommended.

<Content>Just Perfect...... Been to Berlin 4 times and the hotels just seem to get better  better. Great location, right on Ku Dam. The all english speaking staff could not have been more helpful. A super hot buffet to start your day . Great sized bedroom complimented by high standards that you only expect from German hotels. Try Joes resturant for excellent food and great prices. Recommend the grilled Zander (fish) Planning to go back for the Xmas markets. Will stay at the same Hotel ... WILLIAM  PAULINE MCcULLOUGH BELFAST  N. IRELAND

<Content>very clean and friendly hotel I booked this hotel through an internet site for German hotels and wasn't dissappointed.The cost of the hotel was the same as others in the area but this one included breakfast. It was situated right in the middle of all the exclusive and designer shops on the Kurfurstendamm which is THE place to shop till you drop!Only a 2 minute walk to the S-Bahn and the U-bahn.Breakfast was plentiful and very good with choice of hot and cold buffet. Bar area was open until 2 am with an excepionally long happy hour!Reception staff couldn't have been more helpful, informing us of places to see and how to negotiate the underground system.Rooms were very clean and spacious as one would expect from German standards.

<Content>nice stay, reminds me of nice us hotel This is one of many hotels on Ku'Damm, my boyfriend and I thought it was very nice. Not too far down on Ku'Damm, so you can walk from the Zoologischer Garten S-Bahn. I guess pricier than others, but the room was really nice, good breakfast, really no complaints...
