<Content>Spotless and comfortable but not quite the Russian experience it's billed as This hotel is great if you don't need the amenities of a big hotel but want somewhere with a large and spotless room and bathroom, in a characterful property, in a good location.There is no internet computer in the lobby and no sports facilities (though a small gym seems to be under construction). They don't offer dinner though the breakfast is a good spread of continental hot and cold dishes including some quite exotic things like blinis, smoked salmon and delicious cakes. Locally there are lots of restaurants for dinner - and indeed breakfast if you forego the hotel's 11 euro offer.The location is good, very close to Eberswalderstr. on the U2 line which takes you through the eastern and (eventually!) the western centres directly. It is also on the tram. 5 mins' taxi from Alexanderplatz. The apartments occupy the rear courtyard of a massive twin-courtyard complex from the late 19th century so don't have road noise. The small lobby is on the street so is easy to find. Staff were very helpful in the instance when my door electronic card stopped working (twice...).It is very new and the standard and cleanliness of decor is extremely high. We had a large twin / triple (the sofa doubles as a bed and is not badly sized) which was about 300 sq ft in total. The beds are comfortable but in twin configuration are very narrow - definitely under 3 feet wide. A shame since the room is definitely big enough to take a larger pair of beds. A small and functional kitchenette (2 hobs, sink, fridge, crockery, cutlery) is provided but we didn't use it. Also a 26 approx. LCD TV with about 40 channels.Definitely recommended.
