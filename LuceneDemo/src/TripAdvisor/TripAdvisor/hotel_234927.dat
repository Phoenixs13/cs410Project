<Content>A comfortable family owned samll hotel My German sister in law booked this small, inexpensive hotel and I highly reccomend it for those on a budget. It was spotlessly clean and comfortable and about 60 euros a night for one. The breakfast had everything you could want . It was around the corner from the subway. It is a bit of a ride to downtown Berlin, but the town itself has much to reccomend it--not the least a small restaurant Behind the more famous Kolk ( about a half block, white with brown timber on the outside) that served the best duck I ever remember eating , for about 15 euros .
