<Content>Loved the Tegel Airport Ibis We stayed one night in May and one night in July 2008 at the start and end of our German holiday. We were very happy with the hotel each time and would certainly stay there again. From Tegel airport we took the #128 bus to Residenzstrasse and walked about 8 minutes to the hotel. (2.10 euros per person, pay the driver, he can give change). Going back to the airport for an early flight we took a taxi (18 euros inc tip). We found the front desk friendly and helpful and the rooms were basic but very clean, quiet and comfortable which was all we needed. I booked the room on the Ibis website and got a very good internet rate. The excellent buffet breakfast is extra. The free internet in the lobby is a nice bonus. There are a couple of bistro/restaurants nearby for suppers.

<Content>Value fallback solution Berlin normally offers plenty of accomodation at reasonable rates. But sometimes the German capital can be very busy, like during the G8 summit meeting.Then I like to return to one of the first ibis locations, which I know for more than 20 years. The location is between TXL and the new Central Railway station (taxi 10 鈧?from TXL). I know about their good service, I get an attractive rate, I am checked in 15 min after leaving Tegel airport. Location, price and service that's what counts for me.You'll find the usual ibis furniture, rather small rooms, but a good buffert breakfast. And a few restaurants around for dinner or just a beer or Berliner Wei脽e.In the off season I choose more attractive offers of the big chains (e.g. the new Novotel Tiergarten), but (secret !) I always get a room in Reinickendorf, even at convention times.
