<Content>The good and the bad The Good; clean rooms, nice bed, modern rooms.The Bad; elevator did not work, press 3 go to 4th floor. Internet problems, no ice machine, analog cable on digital tv (whats the point), no breakfast, no microwave, no ref, coffee maker per cup pot, stairs go to the outside on first floor not the lobby, rated a 3 star I would give it 2.

<Content>Not all that for the price No meal is included in the price. There was no fridge or microwave in the room.There was no ice machine or vending machines on any floors.I had to pay $3 for a small bottle of water which is ridiculous.Their shuttle does not go to the airport.The room door lock was broken and I reported it the same day when I checked in but no one came to look at it. I reported it again two days later to the night manager and he immediately exchanged my room. I was impressed with that but why did it took so long before anything was done. I guess guests safety are not a big concern.Their drivers are very friendly and helpful.There were birds outside my room window that kept me up most of the night.What spoiled my trip was next day after checking in I developed these hives-like rashes and bumps all over my body including my face, neck, etc., which probably resulted from the chemicals used in the shower water.

<Content>Ugh! Gross place, don't ever stay here It's close to Dadeland Mall, yes, but the place is a mess. I don't understand how after such a big renovation into this newer brand, it still has moldy smelly rooms and stains everywhere. The staff was outright rude and gave me attitude at every turn. The walls are paper-thin and the noise from Kendall Drive outside is too much to handle. Don't ever stay here if you want a decent visit. Not a chance i'll ever return again.

<Content>Nothing special On this visit we chose the Indigo beacuse of price. The hotel is very clean as it is new, but noisy as it is on the main road.Staff not very helpful.Good location for the mall with complimentary shuttle service to the mall only and not the airport as there was when we stayed in the Hampton Inn. No complimentary breakfast but Strbucks across the road as their food was not cheap.Rooms very new, noisy air condtioning.Although cheaper prefered the Hampton Inn

<Content>Ridiculous The rooms are nice but the customer service is subpar. I called the guest services desk requesting a a safety pin..the front desk worker stated that she would call back and never did. On another day and time I called inquiring about whether or not they have TNT and again another worker stated that she would call me back. After 30 mins I decided to call again since she never did. Unfortunately for me they didnt have TNT. This hotel while is not one where you would want to stay if customer service is high on your priority list. Unfortunately for me, I didnt find out until it was too late.

<Content>Great renovation  I recently stayed at the Indigo. They just finished a huge renovation and the hotel looks great. Very modern in feeling---very nice showers in the bathrooms instead of the traditional bathtubs. They have a small, but nice restaurant/bar area with some good food options. I was in South Miami for business  also did some shopping at the Dadeland Mall---the hotel was conveniently located for both.
