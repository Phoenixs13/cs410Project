<Content>Missed the chance to try it! We saw the Trip Advisor page on Robert Ramon but saw it had no reviews. It looked nice and the price was right so I booked this hotel via our travel agent who took our credit card to hold the room and provided us with a confirmation number and paperwork showing we had a triple room booked for 2 nights. We assumed we were good to go. (YES, I should have booked it with Trip Advisor!)Upon arrival at Robert Ramon (after a 45 minute subway ride in Brussels and a 2 hour train ride to Amsterdam followed by navigating Amsterdam with a 10 year old and three suitcases), we were to say the least, tired and stressed but ready to check in. Alas, the Robert Ramon claimed they didn't have our reservation and no rooms available for two nights. After a futile attempt by our travel agent to correct the situation, they only offered us the ability to find another hotel in Amsterdam. From what we could observe with the staff, they were new, timid and lacked confidence (and apparently the ability to help us), so they asked the manager to come up from the basement. The manager was abrupt but polite and told us there was nothing she could do and mocked our travel agent for making this error - not taking any responsibility what-so-ever. I immediately called our agent on my cell phone and she agreed to talk to them, but still wouldn't budge. She called one hotel, booked it and gave us directions how to get there, so for that we can thank her. Little did we know it was on the edge of the Red Light District - however it was much less expensive than Robert Ramon, the staff there was VERY helpful and the rooms were clean. The hotel was similar to what we saw here on Trip Advisor. I was surprised at the sparce, TINY lobby. We had to be buzzed into the lobby by the front desk staff so I'm assuming they've either had issues with transients or they prefer the security. Neutral mono-chromatic decor, looked very modern. The hotel appeared to still be doing some renovations as well. Save your money if you want to avoid snooty staff and mixups - The Terminus Hotel on Beursstraat was a MUCH better choice!
