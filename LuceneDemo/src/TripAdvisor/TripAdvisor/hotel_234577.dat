<Content>Not too bad I've actually stayed in this hotel for more than 2 months if you count everything over the last 8 years. Generally this hotel is pretty decent, but only on a relative scale. I stayed here for work and the room prices were always negociated, often significantly.The rooms are clean. The showers work acceptably, but they don't have an actual door, they just have a divider which leads to water on the floor. It's manageable. The drains are slow in every room I've stayed in (6 different ones or so). Again, it's manageable.The best thing about this hotel is that there is a train stop within a 3 minute walk. Take this to go downtown. It's smooth and easy.I recommend a short drive to the nearby mall if you want somewhere quick to eat. (Eroski is the name of the mall) There are some good options there. Service in the hotel restaurant is horrible and everything is very expensive. If you are going to eat, eat at the bar. It's faster and the food is fine. The only downside is that you won't be able to eat at an actual table. Be warned, the drinks cost a fortune.  The high speed internet is hit or miss. Depending on your room location it can work well or not at all. The internet is via 1 hour or 24 hour access cards. The one hour is 7.5 Euro? 24 hour= 12 Euro? (very close to that range anyway)

<Content>Truly uninspiring hotel and location Novotel has a monopoly in its out-of-the way industrial park, which is clear in both prices and what you get.In spite of being new-ish the hotel feels faded. The rooms are ok sized, but nothing special and the stench of cigarettes can be overpowering even for people who smoke themselves. The service all depends on who you talk to and their mode. The service has been both exceptional and otherwise. The food should simply be avoided.Two issues:Location-wise, note that it is often difficult to get a cab in evening, so you might have to wait for an hour or more. The wifi is unreliable, and if you get a connection depends on where yr room is located.I've stayed here a number of times with work, but not since I found San Cugat Hotel and Restaurant in nearby San Cougat proper.

<Content>Bad Service/Bad Food I stayed in this hotel 8 nights (I wish I could move to another hotel but it had been already paid by my company). Everyday I was negotiating with the lady answering the phone from the room sevice, to bring me a coffee in my room. One time she told me that i should come downstairs to pick it up instead of calling the room sevice as the hotel was very busy...It is the first time in my life that I stay in a NOVOTEL and I face such problems..and the problem was repeated every day.... The food was unacceptable, and generally i think that the NOVOTEL standards are not followed in this hotel.

<Content>Basic, and stranded without a car I stayed at the novotel for 4 nights, and it was basically what I expected, maybe a little worse. The good parts:Room was fairly large, clean (but could use updates), and the staff were friendly / competent. It was quiet.The bad parts: being in an industrial park near the highway, I did not feel like I could walk anywhere so I was forced 2 nights for their room service, which literally had TWO choices. Choice one (ham) and choice two (spanish omelet). I also did not like the room set up in that I ran my toe into the sofa sleeper next to the bed (which I never used) until I got smart and wrapped a towel around the metal leg (which the maid removed every day so I had to start over.) They did offer high speed internet, but at 9Euro an hour I decided to do dial up. The shower sprayer never stayed in position so I had to shower with my body almost glued to the shower wall. Ugh. I would stay at the Sant Cugat H  R next time, but it was full.
