<Content>Looks can be deceiving We checked in our room about 10:00 pm on a Saturday night and were ready to go to bed. WELL my husband pulled back the covers and lo and behold there is hair in the bed and not just one, the sheets had OBVIOUSLY not been changed and so we checked the other bed (room w/two queens) and it to had NOT been changed. We called the front desk and they sent someone to our room to see. They did give us another room but no other compensation. But was told by the guy who took us to the other room I did pull back the covers and there was only an eye lash and kind of chuckled. My view is They should not have to check the bedding it should automatically be changed no matter what!

<Content>Good Value for Your Money Microtel Plano is a clean, comfortable, basic hotel. It has a Preston Road address but is set back from Preston Road and a little hard to find. Going south on Preston Road, just past the exits from George Bush Turnpike, turn right at Silver Star Motorcars. Follow the road which has a wall on the right.The bed was comfortable and the in-wall air conditioner and heating unit worked well. In-wall units tend to be noisy, in my opinion, and I would judge the noise about average for this type of unit. The continental breakfast offered coffee, juice, cereal and bagels, but no donuts or pastries. The phone service included free local and long distance calls with excellent voice quality. The free high speed wireless internet access worked well from my laptop computer. The TV system offered a good selection of local and cable channels but not a full lineup of extended basic cable channels.I would recommend Microtel Plano to guests looking for a good basic budget hotel.
