<Content>hotel with a bit of a difference Great location- very central, yet off the main street. Also close to good restaurants and clubs.This is not your standard holiday inn/carpet everywhere type hotel- every room is different and the building is what they call an altbau in Germany (not purpose built, but used to be flats) so it has lovely spacious rooms with high ceilings. Nice to have something other than landscapes on the walls, too (mostly artworks of males) Only downside is that it can be a bit noisy at timesI really enjoyed the breakfast, too.

<Content>Rude owners, noisy This was my worse experience in a gay owned BB. Avoid.The description in TimeOut guide to Berlin (page 209, 2004 edition) says 'comfortable rooms' and 'sumptuous breakfast'. Neither is the case.1) Breakfast is OK, but far from sumptuous, with bread rolls whose crust is hard as rock - 100 miles removed from traditional, nice German bread2) The main problem however is not breakfast, but the rooms. They are spacious, but incredibly noisy. There is an incredible amount of noise coming from both inside and outside the hotel.Inside the hotel, the corridor floors are creaky and the doors badly insulated for corridor noise, which means that from about 7 am one can hear people milling around outside the room on their way to breakfast.Much worse, street noise is strong, but also there is a night club on the ground floor, whose thumping music resonates in the rooms. We had to sleep with earplugs. Hardly what you would call 'comfortable'3) To compound it all, apart from one member of staff, service is at best uninterested, at worse rude. After the first night I complained about the noise and said I wanted to move out. Because I had paid for 3 nights on arrival, I wanted a refund of the unused two nights. The owner suddenly became very angry, made comments on the verge of racism (which country do you come from?) and called me stupid for wanting a refund. It was their terms and conditions, and if I didn't like it, tough, but I would have to forfeit two nights' payment

<Content>ArtHotel is unqiue and wild, but not the best nights sleep I've stayed at the ArtHotel a number of times. I must say, in many senses it is a wonderful and unique place that caters to gay men who aren't afraid to have fun. In another sense, the place is a bit crude. The rooms are colorful but the floors are often cracked and clean but poorly kept. There tend to be reasonable sized cracks in the bedroom door leaving you to hear footstep taken down the hall. This is praticularly bad because many of the guests at ArtHotel tend to be larger men wearing leather boots comming back from a good night out. Suffice to say, they have HEAVY steps.The younger guy that works there tends to be very nice and as helpful as he can be. The proprieter who is always dressed in leather can be rude, disrespectful and egotsitc at times. I've never had serious confrontations, but I've been made to feel like I was a loathly pion in his great empire on a number of occassions. The ArtHotel has an apartment room that isn't bad because it has a seperate entrance and you don't have to deal with foot traffic. I'd stay here again if I wanted a hot room to have kinky sex in. I'd not stay here to get good sleep and enjoy something that's actually nice.

<Content>Colorful gay hotel This place is a trip in itself! First, you need to forget all notions of a hotel as a separate, purpose built structure. This hotel is converted from what must have been an enormous apartment on the third floor of a pre-war luxury apartment building. So the entire hotel is on one level, with the very high ceilings typical of similar buildings of that era. The art in the hotel name refers to the paintings -- consisting mostly of, uh, male figurative art -- that cover the walls. No two rooms are the same. Some of the original rooms have been subdivided and most have had bathrooms (necessarily small) added. Each room has TV with local channels plus CNN and BBC, a telephone, and a mini bar with a few items. Each room is a different color, and we are not talking beige and cream here, but rather scarlet, cobalt, daffodil, etc. The furniture is likewise electic; a lot of it appears to be older pieces repainted in black or lavender to smarten things up. The hotel website includes pictures of each room so you can see what you are getting. A wireless connection is available in the rooms if you want to use your own laptop; if not, there is also a computer for guest use. The front office is attended rather sporadically but you get three keys for the duration of your stay: one of the building entrance, one for the hotel entrance, and one for your room. There is an ample German-continental breakfast included in the price of the room. Staff members I encountered included a striking gentleman in full leather outfit, and a gracious youth in more conventional attire. And yes, the floors creak and the public lighting is dim. The hotel is very well located for Berlin's gay Sch枚neberg district, and there is even a gay bar/club/cafe complex on the first floor of the building. Literature on gay Berlin with maps, etc, is in the rooms too. If you must have the predictability of Holiday Inns and Hilton Hotels, or if you are a complainer or whiner, this place is not for you. Its too eccentric. If you can take an amiable and oddball experience like this in your stride, go there -- its a blast!

<Content>Great Gay Hotel My friend and I stayed here and were impressed by the central location to the gay scene in Berlin. Rooms are clean and well equipped. Bathrooms are small but not a negative. The staff was helpful and courteous. Breakfast buffet was great. An all around positive experience.

<Content>Central Location -- Very Clean I have to say I am really glad I stayed here. It is a very central location to the gay area and the U train. It is also walking distance to the huge amazing department store. Having the club downstairs was fun -- easy access to boys. There is also a great bar next door with lots of cute/30 something guys. The boys in the bar under the hotel were a bit twinky. Easy access to 'fun' -- it was never more than a few mins away. Sauna/video places. Bars. You name it. Upon check in I was given a mag with a list of everything happening in the city. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen but I was only in there to shower. The shower had great pressure. The bed was more comfortable than it looked. It was sort of hospital bed-ish but when you are exhausted...it doesnt matter. The hotel was ALWAYS clean and breakfast was always served on time. I have to say staying here really made it easy to get my bearings.Also found a great tour guide. 7 hour tour for 70 dollars. Look him up at hotmal -- sfwanderer (Tom) made berlin come alive for me.

<Content>Great all round hotel It was everything we expected. All great rooms. Nice touches - good size (some bathrooms on the small side). Very quiet. Nighclub on ground floor must close all doors and windows after 10 PM - no sounds can be heard. Excellent breakfast - good variety. Staff very friendly and helpfull. Perfect English spoken. Excellent location - 5 minutes from the heart of (West) Berlin and all the shops and restaurants. Immediate area is one of the gay areas.

<Content>don't ever stay here Travelled here during May 2006 and spent 5 nights in the Art Hotel Connections, Fruggerstasse 33, Berlin, located just above the connections gay disco and garage fetish shop.I could sum up this experience in two simple words: NEVER AGAINHowever, for the benefit of the reading public, gay travellers, respectable people and in particular gay respectable professional well travelled couples, then i'll say a bit more.The decor is poor...an kind of dingy dark salmonly colour adorns the walls. the carpets are tacked down for some reason running up the centre of the hallway floors. The room was small with a modest wardrope that had a very awkward stiff door. The bedroom door was also very awkward to open and we skint our knuckles opening it from the outside most days. There were no drawers or other places of storage for your clothes/belongings.On arrival, Leonardo the owner, meets you in all his leathers (which is fine) but for some reason seems to insist on feeling you up.....!!Breakfast was laughable. Sure there's some cereal, very watery orange juice, some cold meats and luke warm potatoes...........however try and get a boiled egg and you'd have to queue at the breakfast room from about 4am.......as, for some reason, they only seem to make 3 or 4 boiled eggs.......for about 15 guests!! Ask for another one to be made so that you can actually have one...and you get a -25C frosty reception, a huff, sigh, bit of sulking and stomping.......then you might get one...boiled for all of 30 seconds and unedible.Every floor board in the entire hotel seems to creek at about 60 decibells.......so with all the coming and going day and night..then it's kinda hard to get a decent sleep / rest....i'm actually home now for a rest !Ask if they can book you the private transfer to the airport (chauffeur service - which is good actually), then you get the same huffing, sighing and stomping response as mentioned above.Often when we go on trips, we come back and recommend hotels, places or countries to our friends, families, colleagues etc.....however this hotel will certainly not be mentioned to anyone in this regard.....quite the opposite infact.I believe in supporting gay owned businesses or ventures.........just the same as i believe in supporting gay friendly businesses......however i also believe in high quality standards when paying good money for services and accommodation......i never mind paying for quality. Here at Art Hotel Connections you are most definetly ripped off for your pink pound and i will in future spend my money in a large multi national hotel chain.......who will undoubtedbly have higher room and general hotel standards.....and probably much better breakfasts (which wouldn't be difficult).And when one mentions these above complaints to Leonardo, the leather clad owner, you are met with a shrug and a pigeon english reply basically making out that he doesn't really understand or cant be bothered! Do yourself a favour and stay in a more mainstream hotel....all of which by the way are very gay friendly and have far far higher standards in all respects. My overall rating = 1/10....( and the 1point is only cos it gave us somewhere to leave our stuff and sleep). Very disappointed at the gay community ripping off the gay clients!

<Content>Awfull This was a very last minute booking as the homesstay we had intended to use had double booked.We were charged EUR120 per night for the smallest room I have ever seen. This was complete with 3/4 dble bed and a stud wall toilet with no ensuite facility.The room was situated in from of the hotel directly above the connection night club. As a result the music could be heard in the room and everything vibrated with the bass.The cleanliness was somewhat questionable and the room felt seedy. It is a shame that specialist gay hotels seem to have the impression that everyone just wants a room for sexual purposes.

<Content>Disappointed Having visited the Art Hotel Connection in 2002, I was looking forward to going there again on a recent trip with a friend who had never been to Berlin. I knew it was in a great location, near several gay clubs, as well as a short walk away from the massive KaDeWa department store. I was disappointed, and a bit embarrassed, to find that it was not as pleasant as I had remembered. Although the room was relatively clean, it was in need of a good dusting. The switch on the lamp next to my bed was broken, so I had to take it apart to turn the lamp on and off. The bathroom was tiny, even as compared to small bathrooms in other European hotels, so small that I had to leave the bathroom door ajar when I brushed my teeth. To cap it off, one evening as we were heading out to the clubs, the doorknob fell off in my hand! If I ever have the opportunity to visit Berlin again, I am sorry to say I won't likely be staying here.

<Content>Good hotel in great location We stayed here in early September 2004 for five nights. In general it was a very good experience. The room was quite large especially for Europe standards and for a reasonable price (90 Euros/night for reserving early). The bathroom was tiny, tiny, tiny but workable. The included buffet breakfast was quite generous with bread, cheese, cold cuts. The location for us was outstanding as it's right in the center of one of Berlin's gay villages. We even had a balcony onto the street. Staff was always helpful. We were a tad disappointed with the internet access which wasn't always available and had an annoying keyboard. Would we stay there again though? Quite likely.
