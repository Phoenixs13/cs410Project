<Content>Rudeness in Berlin Was ok if you want to book a double room, get there to find a twin with no apology, and rudeness from receptionists. Did they put ir right? no. It was clean, though.

<Content>Yep decent budget hotel If you are looking for a mid to low range hotel in the heart of Berlin, then this is the one for you. Although it doesn't look much from the outside or reception area, the rooms are really clean and modern. The staff are quite friendly, although they don't all speak fantastic English, they will understand you. The rooms all have ensuite bathrooms, with shower, bath and toilet, which are cleaned everyday. There is satellite tv, which is good as German tv is crap, but no cofee/tea making facilities or hairdryer in our room. It's just a nice basic hotel, the only drawback was the breakfast buffet in the morning which although decent (cheese, meats, breads, fruit, cereals, yoghurt, juice and eggs) was very repetative, and not great for vegetarians.To get to this hotel you can get bus 129 from Zoo, it is about 4 stops, and the bus stop is almost directly infront. Or you can take the U-bahn to Audernerplatz, and the hotel is a short walk past the bank, dunkin donuts, and right next to subway sandwiches. The hotel has its name in big writing on the front, you can't miss it.The only down side is because it is on the main strech, and that our room was front facing on the first floor, it was not as quiet as we like even with double glazing.Enjoy!
