<Content>Excellent Hotel, Superb Location Our Au Pair (who is from Berlin) gave us, as a Xmas present, two nights in this hotel, and we were over joyed with it.The location is outside of the centre in the south east of the city, however the S-Bahn is a 5 min walk from the hotel and provides a fast and easy route into the centre.The hotel was clean, and friendly though on the downside the bar wasn't open during the day.We would recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to visit this wonderful city who do not want to stay in the centre. Koepenick itself is a great little district with several excellent restuarants and bars.
