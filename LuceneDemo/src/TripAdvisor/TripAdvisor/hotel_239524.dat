<Content>Excellent Value Hotel This was an excellent hotel. Very well located - just 2 or 3 stops on the Metro from Placa De Catalunya. Nearest Metro station was Muntaner and was a few steps from the hotel. The Reception staff were really friendly and helpful. The room was clean and spacious and had it's own small kitchen area, lounge and a table to either eat or work at. Excellent value for money and as we stayed at the weekend it was really quiet at night so you had a good nights sleep. Not much to do in the immediate area but as it was so near to the metro this didn't cause any problems.

<Content>not for me... I麓ve stayed for two nights, in single room, in this hotel.脥 must confesse that it was very dissapointing.This is a small aparthotel, well located, in Via Augusta,in a very quiet residential neighbourhood.it was a perfect location for me, but that麓s not the only thing we looked in a hotel.I麓ve check- up late in the night, and at the recepcion I asked for the wake up allarm in the next morning....They forgottened!!!the room was very old, and not very clean. the bed had too much hair...but not mine!The floor was dirty, and I made a test, by putting a small paper (the size of a 2 euros麓s coin) in the bathroom floore in the first night, and i麓t stayed there until I checked out.I knew also every time the metro was passing under the hotel...the breakfast was simple, but ok, and the staff was kindly but not very efficiente.probably I will not repeat this stay.

<Content>Loved the Senator We have arrived home from Spain this week after a great four nights with friends, in the City Senator Hotel, Barcelona. Rooms were basic, clean and comfortable but could have done with a few reproduction paintings or photos, especially about Gaudi, on the walls. The breakfast room was on the small side and if the hotel was full there tended to be a bit of a queue although there was no reason why you could not take your breakfast to your own room. We booked the rooms through Easyjet and paid only 拢203 (299 Euros) for 4 nights bed and breakfast. When you pay a visit to Barcelona you do not spend much time in a hotel room - you spend it in the restaurants and bars and sightseeing, not necessarily in that order!!!

<Content>Hated the Aparthotel Very disappointed in this hotel. Room decor was very drab and claustrophobic. The bed was very squeeky and we could hear the people above moving around as the hotel had wooden floors. Hotel staff were very pleasant though, could't swing a cat in the reception nor the lift. Would not stay there again.
