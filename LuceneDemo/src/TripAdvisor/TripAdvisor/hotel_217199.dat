<Content>Strange smell It is a budget hotel and it definitely feels like one. It is a hotel with outdoor corridor with people just hang out by their doors. The room seems dated but reasonably clean. There is a very strong, bothersome ammonia smell, however. I cannot put my finger on what might be wrong with the hotel but I would say it is at best an ok stay.

<Content>Terri It was very awful! Not clean. The sheets were dirty, pillow smells, and restroom very dirty. Didn't stay more than an hour. I lost my money and checked in at sheraton four star by metro mall, for the same price.

<Content>Marginal in Phoenix Stayed just one night, arrived late into Phoenix, left at 8am the next morning. We wanted to be in north Phoenix, as we were heading to the Grand Canyon the next morning, and did not want to get stuck in bad central Phoenix traffic. It was a good 25% cheaper than anything else I could find nearby. The neighborhood was quiet, we felt safe. The room was very small. Can鈥檛 use a more flattering word than adequate. Bed was comfortable, climate control worked fine, got some decent shut eye. Room d茅cor was passable. Chair in room was clean, but stained and a bit beat up. Sink in bathroom drained very slowly, as if it was 75% clogged, and sink area was a bit beat up. Television was small. Towels were rough on the skin. For this short stay, the hotel worked, but just barely. I could see it not working for the more fussy in the world. The room definitely looked worse in the light of day, versus the night before when I was dead tired. My overall rating: 5.5 out of 10.

<Content>Eww...Gag me!! This place was awful...dirty, people here did not care. I got unexpectedly ill due to a food allergy, and these people could have cared less. Clean??? Hell NO!! They never came and cleaned the room. They did not even throughly clean my room when I became ill. They said that I had to leave in order for my room to be cleaned...this I did, although I wanted to stay because I was not feeling very well!! Charged my credit card way before I left, claiming that my account was overdrawn...what is this a bank?? I think not!! Dissapointed with the service here...if I were you...I would not stay here at all!!

<Content>Stay away from this property This hotel is filthy. When I checked in there was a woman dressed in a tube top and short, shorts. She was paying for another night in cash (all 20's), I think she was a local street entrpreneur because they told her she would need to check out the next day unless she can pay again by 11am. She said she would get more cash tonight so it wouldn't be a problem. This should have been a sign. The room was very dirty at first inspection. Upon closer inspection I found cockroaches and signs of rodents. It looks fine enough from the outside and seems to be in an ok area, the rooms have a kitchen but overall the room is very small - they are microtel of suites. This property is very dirty, don't stay here.

<Content>Bummed at Homestead The hotel was first of all very very dirty, it has great ammenities such as a kitchen with microwave and stovetop and large frige, but the cabinets were coated with grease that got on my clothes when I leaned on them and someone had not cleaned around the toilet or tub in the bathroom for many weeks, it appeared. As I got there on a weekend, there was no one to come and clean it up and the manager said I could change rooms, but they were all in the same state of uncleaniness. Sufice it to say that there were very numerous pubic hairs and instances of wiped nasal discharges on the walls, tubs, counters, etc.This could be a very nice place to stay for a while if anyone ever cleaned it. I had to get clean sheets as they had not been changed either. The people working there were very nice and helpful, but no help should have been needed. There was also mold all over the bathroom in abundance. I had to go out and buy clorox clean-up to kill it. It was also advertised on-line to have a 27 TV and it only had a 19 TV, and of course nothing could be done about that. I stayed there 2 weeks because my company put me there and I spent two days cleaning the place up. The housekeeping person came and scraped some of the grease off the counter with a credit card as he had no chisel. I had to do the rest as I gathered housekeeping had no clue about how to clean. There is just no excuse for a place being that ill taken care of.
