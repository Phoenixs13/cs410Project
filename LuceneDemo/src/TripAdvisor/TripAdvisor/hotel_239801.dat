<Content>Eh .... I have no problem w/ homosexuals but this place was San Francisco!!! The night girl and I had a laugh about it, she was very helpful, well spoken, professional and the only one we felt comfortable talking to.We stayed for 7 days and its alright _ the kitchen was nice, the sheets and towels are ok and the t.v. was a decent size so it's more then I'd expect when a number is in the title of the place. (Bring your own shampoo! But there is a gas station within walking distance :)

<Content>Not very good value for your $$$ We stayed there one night, hence we did not need to use the kitchen. The sleeping area had looked new or renovated; the two queen beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was a different game, because apart of the refrigerator and microwave, that looked new, the rest of the furniture looked cheap and aged, as well as the bathroom, that shown its age. The tap of the tub was broken 鈥?we could not cut the water; we called the front desk and the tap was immediately repaired. Other problem with the TV set; the volume could not go down to a night level, so at an hour we shut it down not to annoy the neighbour rooms. The wi-fi was available only at a fee (5$) when the motel near offered it for free, as many other around. Considering that we paid 71$ plus taxes, we believe it is overpriced for what it offers.

<Content>Low expectations not even met! I wasn't expecting much and was still disappointed. If you don't need a kitchen, don't bother. The outside looks nice, but the inside is old and has horrible mattresses!!! There was no bedding for the pull out bed. Not just in the room, in the whole hotel. It's supposed to come equiped. Well, we had four of us. It was supposed to have a setting for three. Missing silverware. It had some dishes, but plan to bring your own soap to wash the dishes. The plug in the hotel broke my daughters waterpik for her teeth. The toaster would burn one side of the toast and not even cook the other side. I had to pay a larger rate ($75.00/night) because of Spring Break. It wasn't worth it. I am pretty liberal with hotels, especially when I KNOW it's not the nicest. But really, I wouldn't stay here unless you reaaaallllly have to.

<Content>Find another place to stay. This motel says it caters to exended stays... but the minute we walked in we disliked it. I had expected 'basic accomadations', but this was just unpleasant and uncomfortable.  The room was run down and threadbare, with rips in the sofa, and marks on the walls and cabinets. It was not clean -- sticky surfaces on the counter tops. The coffeemaker was dirty and stained. We had reserved a 2 bed room, which they did not have. Gave us one bed and a single pull out bed, both of which were lumpy (so were the pillows). There was no bedding for the pullout, so we had to go to the office to get it. Only one person was working on the property, so he did not come to the room with the bedding. The pullout was right next to the air conditioner/heater which blew air all night. The windows were cracked above the locks, fortunately ours was a 2nd floor end unit so the window was not reachable from the outside, as most are. The towels were stiff and thin. There was no shampoo. This is the only motel I have ever stayed in where they expect you to empty your own trash. The price, though lower than many in town at the time, was still significantly overpriced considering the poor condition of the room and beds.

<Content>Very Helpful Staff We returned home three days ago from a week-long stay at Studio 6, Deer Valley in Phoenix. It's a great value and nicer than we expected! Bed was better than adequate. They said even the bedspread is washed after each guest leaves. Everything was clean and like new, except some problems with the refrigerator. It stayed cold OK, but leaked once a day and they couldn't seem to fix it permanently. Don't stay in Room 226 unless it is fixed.We like our privacy, so we thought it was a plus to not have daily maid service. As many towels as you want are available at the front desk. A movie theatre is less than a mile away, and several chain grocery stores are close. Freeway 17 is 1/2 block away.The nicest thing about staying there was the friendly helpful staff. They were all nice. For an inexpensive place, we'd give it a 90.

<Content>Good Value for the Money We stayed at this facility 9 nights during the Barrett-Jackson car auction. It is located appx 17 miles north of there. The room was a King with a couch and all the other ammentites as listed. My only issues was the carpet needed to be shampooed and the corners near the couch and around the bed were not vacumed sufficiently. Also I had to wait appx 4 hours on day #2 for clean linen as I noticed stains on the thermal blanket so I stripped the ENTIRE bed! However, I was given new mattress pads and a thermal blanket which was a good as I would want it! The pots were cheap and bendable but pratical. We paid $38 night for 2 adults so it was worth the money, most other people paid over $200 night to attend the auction. I would certainly stay again, the visit was average,not bad,not excellent, just average. One front desk staff attendent did tell me how tired she was which I thought was very unprofessional. As a bonus fresh Otis Spunkmeyer cookies are baked each night for guest:)

<Content>Busy area The staff there was not extremely helpful and often seemed like you were a bother when you asked them for something. The cleaning staff always seemed to be cleaning but the room we stayed in for a week never got any attention. My husband had stayed there previously and had the same experience with the cleaning and he had been there over 2 weeks. At least they do give you clean towels - but you have to go to the office for them.
