<Content>Great hotel Just got back from a trip from Spain. Booked this hotel mainly for the location as it was right along Las Ramblas and very close to the Airport Bus Stop. Location was fantastic as it is on the side street and while it was close to everything, it was still very quiet at night. There was a little noise every night when the garbage trucks came by but this wasn't that big of a deal.Rooms were very modern looking (maybe just renovated?) and the staff was very friendly and helpful. You need a cable to connect to the internet in your room, which the hotel staff graciously lent me. This is a great hotel for someone who wants a nice, clean, moderate price hotel along Las Ramblas but exactly right on it.

<Content>Great Hotel Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel over a weekend in april for his birthday.Although a tad pricey for a 3*, it was definitely worth it!The hotel is really nice and clean and very spacious!We stayed in a double room which had a huge bed and a big widescreen T.V. The bathroom was also very nice, clean and spacious.The location is perfect. Just off las ramblas, yet quiet enough for a good nights slepp. In walking distance of everywhere. The tube is just up the road.I would definitely reccommend this to everyone visiting Barcelona!

<Content>Modern, Clean and Convenient Hotel Turin Hotel is a little place tucked in quiet Pintor Fortuny just off Las Ramblas. The rooms themselves are large by European standards and spotlessly clean and modern. We booked a triple room and were given a nice, quiet one with two single beds and one double. The entrace to the room is the washroom itself (strange, I understand); but there's really nothing wrong with that. We liked how the sink was separated from the toilet and shower by a sliding glass door. The overall spaciousness of the room was a luxury we enjoyed, as wellTurin Hotel is situated in a quiet area that is less than 3 minutes away from the action of Las Ramblas. Across the street, there is a place for tapas; there are also a few restaurants within 2 minutes walking distance too. (However, we recommend Ciutat Comtal for tapas in Barcelona; see my review for it!) There was a breakfast for a fee of around 鈧?0, but we didn't pay for that, seeing that there was McDonald's and various other restaurants in the vicinity of Placa Catalunya (which is only around 5 minutes away by foot). The staff were helpful and somewhat friendly. Overall, staying at Turin Hotel was delightful. I only have praise for it!

<Content>Excellent choice for a 4-5 day stay Located at 3 minutes walk from the noisy La Rambla the hotel is quiet and clean, the staff were particularly helpful in giving any kind of information including bus routes, the best beaches, calling taxis. The large room had a balcony on a small square with a couple of bars but there was no disturbing noise from outside when the window (with double glazing) was closed, despite 15,000 Harley Davidsons assaulting Barcelona during our stay!The only niggle I can make is the lack of a fridge in the room, it would have been very useful with the hot temperature we found!Absolutely recommended, I'll surely go back to this hotel the next time I'll be in Barcelona (and considering how beautiful this city is, it won't take long).

<Content>Convenient and clean Very conveniently situated just off the Ramblas and walking distance from Catalunya Plaza and the aerobus stop. Spotlessly clean but somewhat impersonal rooms, but who cares if it is comfortable Whogoes to Barcelona to sit in a hotel room? Staff not outstandingly friendly apart from the girls but they were helpful via email before arrival. Breakfast is a bit expensive, we didn't try it. Better to have a lie-in and turn right out of hotel and first right for a famous cafe (on the left) and chocolat spot, the name of which eludes me. Opposite there is also a good traditional Spanish restaurant with a good atmosphere  friendly staff. Recommend hotel for value and position especially for first visit. This was my 5th visit to Barcelona and still discovering loads of new things. Some reviews said it was noisy but as usual main noise was from other guests slammings doors in the early hours. I recommend wax ear plugs, also there was a lot of light at night through the glass sliding door to bathroom, so hang something dark over the bathroom window to cut down light levels if you like dark at night.

<Content>Loved the location We have just returned yesterday from a vacation in Barcelona and Costa Brava. I have booked on hotel website our 3 nights stay in Barcelona after reading favourable comments on TripAdvisor. The Location of this hotel is excellent on a nice side street of Ramblas called Pintor Fortuny full of four star hotels ,away from the noise of Ramblas but very close to all the action. When I booked on line I have requested a quiet room which we did get it when we checked in.We arrived early around 11:30 a.m and we get the room right away. The room was modern and recently renovated , clean ,facing the back of the building and therefore very quiet . The room was not too large but just right for the time we have spent in the hotel. The bathroom was very nice ,very clean and the shower pressure was excellent. The only small issue was that hotel provided a very good quality soap but very small. We did ask reception for additional soap and we did get it right away. The room has a safe which was not easy to handle and almost every time I had to call reception to unlock it. We did always get good response from reception and all our requests were fulfilled. I do have to say that reception staff did smile inspite of the only complain about this hotel I read from other travellers. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel which was an additional 11 euro/person. There is a large supermarket just around the corner on Ramblas about 2-3 minutes walk which opens at 9:30 or 10:00 a.m and close at around 9:00 p.m. where we bought water and breakfast or we get our light breakfast at Starbuck which is on Ramblas around the corner 2-3 minutes from the hotel which opens early. There is a restaurant just across the hotel serving breakfast,lunch,dinner and several tapas in a placa a few steps from the hotel which we did not use.In summary the Hotel Location is excellent and is a nice,clean, modern 3 star hotel ,on a very nice street.

<Content>Great hotel, great location The hotel was easy to find, just off Las Ramblas. It is within minutes of the Catalunya metro station. There is a supermarket just round the corner, which is very convenient as I did not try the hotel breakfast.Some staff were nicer than the others. I stayed in a triple bedded room and it was not as small as I imagined. The bathroom was nice and clean, with a brilliant shower. The safe was easy to operate too.My room faced the front of the hotel and it can be very noisy at night, which my friends complained heavily about. Maybe I was too tired so I slept fine. It helps a great deal if you shut the balcony door.The hotel also has a left luggage room, with individual lockers. I find this to be a great feature as some hotels I stayed just have a room where anyone can wander in.I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Good hotel I stayed at the Turin Hotel one night when the other hotel I was at was totally booked. The room was small but clean and comfortable and newly renovated. Excellent location just off Las Ramblas. The rooms are all non smoking. Two English channels on the tv - CNN and EuroSports. The staff was efficient and pleasant. I would definitely stay there again and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone going to Barcelona.

<Content>Unfriendly place We stayed at the Hotel Turin for one night but would not go there again. It is very convenient to the Ramblas which suited us but in other respects the hotel was not for us. The staff NEVER smiled (I have found that at other Barca hotels - perhaps it's us!).We had an early flight on our departure morning and turned up in the breakfast room to be told that coffee (which was all we had time for) was not available unless we paid for the full breakfast. A hotel that does not serve coffee - unbelievable. The room was OK but nothing spectacular for the money. Perhaps if we had agreed to stay longer the overall impression might have been better - though I doubt it.

<Content>Best Kept Secret Right off the Ramblas, this hotel is right next door to a small plaza with 3 restaurants. The location is perfect and quiet considering you are only steps from the madnass of LAS RAMBLAS. Steps from Plaza Catalunya. The rooms are very modern and clean. The design of the room is very functional and SUPER clean. If you are looking for a hotel where the staff is constantly greeting you and brown nosing this hotel is not for you.The staff acts more like security, after 12 they lock the doors and only let guests in which makes you feel safe.The staff was friendly provided irons, directions, recommendations to nearby places and arranged cabs.Overall If you are spending too much time in the hotel you are really not seeing Barcelona. This is a great place to drop your bags and go enjoy the city- only to come home to a clean well lit modern room.

<Content>Hotel Turin a gem with a perfect location This hotel was a half-block off the center of Las Ramblas, right near the Bougeria. I didn't see it in any of my books.I had tried to book a room in Barcelona for a Friday night only on line with no success; walked up to Hotel Turin and got one at a reasonable price on the spot. Many places won't let you book for a single night. Room was small, but quiet, clean, nice bathroom, flat-screen LCD TV, etc. A bonus-it was located right near the Metro stations and right by an understreet parking lot too...location and price combo couldn't be better...give it a try with confidence.

<Content>not great! We found ourselves without a room for one night during our stay in Barcelona  approached the Tourist Office for help. They booked us into the Turin Hotel which claimed to be 3-star - - By whose standards I'd like to know! The staff behaved like they were desperate to be somewhere else. We were squeezed into an awkward room on the 7th floor with a shabby interior and a new plastic 3-starred shower curtain hiding an ancient tub. It was musty smelling and the air conditioning unit was primative. The location was good, just of Las Ramblas but I wouldn't stay there again unless it was another tight pinch! Be warned.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed here in August 2006, our family of 2 adults and 2 kids in one room, and grandma in another room. The hotel is in an excellent location, near the Ramblas but far enough away from the noise. The rooms were very clean and plenty big enough for us. The air conditioning was really appreciated in the heat of August! The single room was quite noisy at night maybe from a nearby boiler. The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly. We would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Good location I found the Hotel Turin easily after gettig off the bus from the airport. The location is excellent, just off Las Ramblas, close to Placa Catalunya. Our room had a lovely big balcony, it was quiet, no groups of sceaming schoolkids, and it was clean and tidy. The staff were a mixed bunch. Some were friendly, others not so. I guess it is like that in most places with numerous staff. Most staff spoke some English. I speak Spanish, but my friend does not. Breakfast is served, but we didn't have breakfast so I cannot comment. My only grumble was that when I booked online, I specified a twin room. I did get that, but the two single beds were actually together. I was travelling with a friend, not a partner, and I prefer some distance between the beds. However, I would very happily stay at the Hotel Turin again.

<Content>Smoking Rooms Only at Turin Stayed at the Hotel Turin for 2 nights. It has an excellent locationif you are there for sight-seeing and shopping. This 3 star hotelwould have been perfect for me (reasonably priced and cleanbathroom), if not for the fact that they have zero non-smoking rooms.  My first night I couldn't stand the smell of the aircon (smelled like stale cigarettes). So I had to sleep with the windows open. However, when the window in my room was opened, I could smellthe exhaust blowing from the restaurant and the noise of the next door bar(until past 1 AM) kept me up most of the night.

<Content>Showers outside , but not inside.... We've just had 3 nights at the Turin,a second stay.Simple, no frills hotel, but with problem of no hot water for 24 hours, affecting the whole hotel. Did not get impression that this was being treated as huge priority, but this may be laid back approach- water always coming in '... 1 or 2 hours'.Were offered paltry 20e discount for one night, which was ,I thought gruffly, increased to 50e for inconvenience of no shower on day of arrival , nor following morning (none in fact until approx 5pm).Perhaps one bar of regulation minute hotel soap , and 2 hotel sachets of shower gel for 2 people per day indicative of how often they think one should shower, but for us it's twice a day, hence 4 showers missed.Otherwise hotel OK, in V good location , and would go there again.We recommend Elizabeths(Carrer D'Elisabets) for 'local'lunch, and Crema Caramella (nr Placa Real- must book))for dinner. V different , but both excellent in their own way.

<Content>Great Value The Hotel Turin was exactly what my husband and I were looking for. The price was right and the location was better. Right off of La Ramblas (main tourist street) was very convienent for stopping back at the hotel to change and drop things off. Rooms were a nice size and the bathroom was larger than I have seen in Europe. The noise was bearable but I am from NYC so noise does not bother me. Recommend a stay here.

<Content>Most comfortable sheets in the world The Turin is notable for having extremely soft and comfortable sheets. We have never seen better linens in any hotel. Otherwise, the furnishings in our triple room were basic, but very clean.As other reviewers mention, the Turin's location is extremely convenient for tourists, near the Plaza Catalunya (subway and train lines) and the Gothic quarter. In June 2005 there was construction on the street with very loud jackhammers beginning at 8 in the morning. We were already up for the day, but anyone who wanted to sleep later would have been out of luck.

<Content>A bit noisy... Great location !!!, next to La Rambla in a quite road, but we were dissapointed with the hygiene of the toilet and the air contitioning (must be on every time we were in the room due to our room seemmed to be on the kitchen and with our window next to the back side of the hotel ) a bit noisy as well as the hairdryer, general speaking, average hotel in a perfect location !!!

<Content>Hotel Turin saves the night Just got back from, Spain on 8/9/2004, took Eurorail over from Seville, to Barcelona, it was a very long trip had no idea where we would stay once we reached Barcelona, but after we got out train staion and to metro to the Las Ramlas area, we stopped in a couple of hotel but did not like the way they look, the we turned a corner and saw Hotel Turin it looked pleaseant went inside spoke tothe desk receptionist got a room just like that for very affordable price (Aug, 4, 2004) went to room 503, it was big enought for 2 people clean nice bathroom, and talk about location location, this is the spot, I would come back again and stay longer.Staff is very helpful and friendly speak clear english, has lots of information on things to do. The best part is after you check out by noon, and say you have some lasts mintues things to do or shop they have lockers in the back of the hotel area so you don't have to worry or carry your luggage around until you're really ready to do, to your next stop on the Eurorail like us, Oh PS our room had a lovely balcony view. See you again soon Hotel Turin and will recommed to co-workers.

<Content>It was ok... Just back from a two night stay in Barcelona. The Hotel Turin is located just off the La Rambla and the street itself is really very quiet despite it's proximity to the bustle of the main road. From the airport just take the bus to the Placa de Catalunya and it's about a 5 minute walk from there. We weren't very keen on the La Rambla itself and would have preferred to have stayed in the Eixample area just north of the Placa de Catalunya which is little more upmarket (i hope that doesn't sound v snobbish). Anyway - the rooms are done out in early 80s decor but there is plenty of room space and large wardrobes with hangers. The bathroom we had was ok - a small window and a slightly smelly shower curtain but plenty of hot water. The hairdyer is however, rather underpowered so if you have long hair, I would advise taking your own with you. The staff are very friendly and helpful - especially the night staff. They always remembered our room number. So all in all, I would say that the hotel was ok. Central location and friendly but don't expect luxury. Oh and there's a restaurant two doors away from the hotel on the corner called 'Caravalla' or something similar which was excellent - service, atmosphere, price and food. I'd really recommend it.

<Content>Great hotel for medium price I have just come back from Barcelona. Staying in Turin Hotel made this trip even more pleasant! My husband and I received in hotel great recommendations for restaurants. Hotel lobby staff was friendly, rooms VERY clean, air conditioning working just perfect not to mention great localization in the heart of Barcelona Old Town just several steps from La Rambla. Highly recommended!!!! On the other hand - go to the restaurant CASA NOSTRA (recommended by Turin Hotel)! It is a pure pleasure. Let the owner Mr. Porfirio and his wife Mrs. Pilar to take care of you. You will remember this dinner for ever!

<Content>Conveniently Located While visiting Barcelona, we chose to stay at Hotel Turin because of its locale. It's centrally located near La Rambla. The hotel had a nice size bathroom, but nothing impressive about the room. There is breakfast onsite which was convenient but the location of the hotel gave access to many restaurants nearby. Barcelona is a great city to visit with lots to see and do, as I like to try different hotels I will probably opt to stay elsewhere on our next trip.

<Content>Great Location and A Reasonable Price When in Barcelona, I usually stay at the Hotel Continental Ramblas, but due to last-minute booking I was unable to get reservations at Continental. I chose the Hotel Turin, if only because it's about the same price as the Continental and as centrally located off La Rambla.The Hotel is on a street called Pintor Fortuny, about 2 blocks from Placa Catalunya. After turning right on Fortuny, the hotel is a block away on the left side. The hotel is a 7-story structure and I was given a room on the 4th floor. It had no view since it was facing the window of another room. The room was a single and it had a single bed and a bathroom that even had a bathtub. The bathtub, however, was not long enough, and so you had to bend your legs while sitting in it. The room accomodations were somewhat spartan though clean. There was a small night table, a small desk built in to the wall and a chair. It had a closet with lots of space for clothes and what not. I was charged 62 Euros for a single. The best thing about this hotel is its location, only a block away from La Rambla, and about 2 blocks from the Boqueria Market. The hotel was surprisingly quiet even though it is close to all the hubbub of La Rambla. I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again, but given a choice, I would still prefer Hotel Continental a few blocks away simply because their room furnishings have a bit more class and breakfast is included with the price. In short, the Turin is a good hotel with a reasonable price and a GREAT location. The room was a bit spartan and a bit small since it was a single but it did have a TV with cable and since I did not spend a lot of time in the room, it was OK.
