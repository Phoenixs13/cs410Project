<Content>The City of New York should protest the use of its name We have lived in central Mexico for 18 years and go to Mexico City often. 6 of us tried the Hotel New York and were disappointed.The interior rooms are dark and dreary. Furniture is old and could be described as Salvation Army style. The bathrooms are small, and all of the water pipes are exposed. They don't give face towels, wash cloths, bathroom mat, tissues, bottled water or hairdryers.We have found better deals for a similar price. The carpet design was horrendous, and clashed with the bedspreads and draperies.The mattress was ok, but they don't have queen or king size beds. The choice is twin or double. The pillows were old and felt like cooked oatmeal.

<Content>Single Female Traveler Thumbs Up I traveled to Mexico City in April for four days as a single 25 year old female without a lick of Spanish. I felt very comfortable in this area of town on my own and was able to walk back and forth to the subway and resturants, etc. I found the staff helpful, and again, I speak no spanish. Not much in the way of ambiance but very clean. I even ate in the resturant once and while I wouldn't recommend it exactly, it was fine. My one complaint is that the hotel was a bit noisy at night. Thin walls and a room adjacent to an airshaft didn't help. But all in all, a good budget option.

<Content>Good place, some drawbacks. After reading some reviews we decided that this place had easy access to the metro, which is does and that it is in a quiet street right off of one of the main streets, which it is. However, we felt that the short walk from the main street to the hotel was all too lonely at night and this made it difficult to move around at night after 9 pm if not with taxis who will overcharge you ridiculous amounts (what was a 2 dollar taxi ride going to a theater became a 12 dollar ride coming back because it was a 'night fee' they were charging). I recommend other hotels like Casa de la Condesa Reforma (in this same 'colonia') which is safer to be out and about at night.The New York, however, does have very clean installations which I am always picky about but our bed was really hard. The room is small but sufficient. We had our breakfast included but we realized afetr paying a lot for our first breakfact that you have to ask for your breakfast stub from the reception.

<Content>Great value hotel in Mexico City I moved from an $80 US per night hotel, which was so noisy I couldn't sleep, to the New York Hotel, which was only $32 per night. Well, it was a great move, because the New York Hotel was just as nice, but extremely quiet, and had friendlier service, and was so much cheaper.  It is only about 200 metres from the Paseo de la Reforma, and about a 4 minute walk from the nearest subway (metro) station (Hidalgo). The price also includes a breakfast of eggs, toast and bacon/ham/sausage.  I found the area to be safe at night. I will definitely stay at the New York Hotel next time I go to Mexico City.

<Content>Great deal I don't remember how we found this place, probably one of the other budget hotels in this area that we go to was full. Clean,friendly and reasonably priced. Great resturant up the street on the corner. Very quiet and safe neighborhood. Close to the metro, and lots of small local bars ane restaurants. Not overrun with tourists, mostly famillies and business people.I hope it dosen't get too popular because we always count on it for a good place to stay for a few days.

<Content>Incredible value in a great neighborhood I'v stayed on and off in this neighborhood for more than 20 years. The Oxford Where I always stayed and loved was looking a little shabby(but probably still a good low budget choice for 12 bucks)so I chose the New York just around the corner -What a treat! My 300 peso single was nicer than any hundred dollar room any where - Great helpful staff (it helps to know a little spanish) and the 7 or 8 block area surrounding the hotel is one of the most charming (albeit a bit down at the heel) safe and comfortable parts of this chaotic city midway between the zocalo and the zona rosa just a few minutes walk to the alameda and the great little restaurant Cafe Trevi -As far as I'm concerned - One of the best hotel deals ever

<Content>Best Small Hotel in Mexico's Largest City Among Mexico City's tall downtown buildings, sits one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. Only 45 rooms, but situated on an extremely quiet street, this hotel has wonderfully colorful room decor, comfortable accomodations, private baths and is convenient to tourists and businessmen alike. Close to Alameda Park, the Zocalo and other attractions and nightlife- the Hotel New York is situated in an extremely ideal location. A small but cozy restaurant is often quite busy and each room has a 27 inch color television. I highly recommend this hotel while visiting Mexico City.

<Content>Great place to stay on a budget The NY Hotel is a great hotel in an excellent location - less than 10 mins from the city center and very close to all subways and buses. The room was small but clean and the service was very good. The price is excellent!!! It is a little old fashioned but very nice and also very safe. The restaurant was the weak spot though, I would not recommend it!!
