<Content>Pick Carefully in Polanco The Hotel Residencia was not bad, but not really a 'boutique' hotel as their Web site stated. The room decor was fine, however sparse, and was suprisingly the size of a suite. Details were amiss however - no hangars in the closet, furniture was slightly mis-arranged, hall lights were burned out and I could not find a thermostat. There were also few electrical outlets. On a positive note the staff was very freindly and helpful, and all but one desk attendant also spoke English. The bed was very nice, with extra long and soft pillows, and the free satellite TV channel options were good. The shower included a full size tub and plently of hot water and water pressure. There was also a kitchenette, but if you are spending this much on a hotel, why not eat out? The fridge was also too tiny for wine or champagne, and was on the floor requiring one to crouch down to use it.Having no business center or computer to use for Internet access was a major fault, and in this price range, I wish I had spent +$50/night for the Nikko, a fantastic hotel. Don't let location be a draw here as it was for me - this was on the very edge of the Polanco district and walking a few blocks was required to get into a decent restaurant and shopping area. Making things worse, its street block was very dark at night. Newton Street is one way in most sections which wreaked havoc with my taxi dropoffs. Hotel Polanco, at the same price point, is a better value if one is in town for leisure and to enjoy this neighborhood conveniently and comfortably. And if you can spend more on the W, Intercontinental, Nikko or La Habita, its definitely worth it.

<Content>Quaint little Hotel If you are tired of the typical Chain Hotel, this is a nice change. The building is older, but the decor and staff are very nice. All rooms are large suites and the resturaunt is a good value. It located in a safe clean zone of Polanco. Convenient to the great eateries Polanco is known for...also has easy access to Chapultepec Park and museums. Metro is a block away.
