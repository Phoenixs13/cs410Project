<Content>excellent hotel for family I stayed at this hotel with my children (ages 10 and 12) and we all loved it. It was clean, quiet, super location. We stayed in a room with 3 small single beds, bathroom attached, on the top floor. We had a view of the back trees and could hear the ringing of the bells in Daam square. There is a grocery store just down the street. The room was very sparse but comfortable. With 3 weeks of traveling in Europe as a mom with 2 kids, this was my children's favourite room.

<Content>Great stay in Amsterdam Good rooms in a central spot. Its rooms are nice and clean. I was in a studio without toilet as well as a full bedded room with toilet and both were great. The small single room is a real good value for a single traveller. The stairs are steep but well worth it.

<Content>Don"t let the stairs fool you I would recommend this hotel to any frugal traveler. Better, quieter and cleaner than any hostel. And after a long summer day of touring the city and its many attractions I was happy to crash into my very pleasant bed. I stayed in the quad room with three friends, both the room and bathroom were of decent size. We had a huge window overlooking a back garden and had plenty of light and fresh air. I stayed in hostels and hotels around Europe and this was one of the best considering the price and excellent location. You really can't ask for a better location.The manager was very sincere and kind. When pressed for money he tried very much to help our tight situation. Eventually he was able to exchange some forgotten US dollars to euros.I would stay here again in a heartbeat. That is if I could scrap up enough money to return,,, p.s. Sara's pancake house, a few doors down makes a great breakfast/brunch stop.

<Content>Best Hotel Manager Ever Upon arriving in Amsterdam, we were very disoriented. We gladly came to find that the hotel that we had booked was not that far away from centraal station and that it was on a very beautiful and popular road in the city. The hotel itself is situated in a beautiful 150 year old building and our room had a great view of Amsterdam out the window. Rudy is the name of the owner/ manager and he is very very friendly. Just a note, the hotel does not have an elevator and the stairs to navigate the place are pretty intense. Once you get past that, the the view, location and price make up for the lack of room amenities and the climb. There is no T.V. or radio, but like I said, the location is worth it along with the fact that Rudy didn't mind us smoking in the room. I recommend staying in room 7 which is a double room and has a shower and a window that is great for people watching and smoking out of. Let me say again that Rudy the owner is awesome. He discounted our room when we decided to stay there for a second go around, and he gave us our favorite room again. All in all this was a great place for a budget travelor to stay and perfect for two young travelers making there way through the bike madness of Amsterdam.

<Content>decent stay for the price Plenty of stairs to climb but I guess that this is the norm for Amsterdam. The hotel manager is helpful and friendly. The bathroom is a little smelly but clean. The shower room is extremely tight. Our room was also quite cozy. The location is excellent, a quick bike ride away to the Anne Frank House or Dam.

<Content>A nice weekend I chose this hotel because it was one of the less expensive I found in Amsterdam. I was a little bit worried before going, but the hotel was okay. It was really clean. The size of the room was normal. We had the key of the hotel main door, so we could get in at any hour. So no problem of finding the door closed. The only bad thing was the tram on the street just under our window... I could'nt sleep well from 6 am, but my boyfriend did'nt hear them... So dependant if you're used to noise during your sleeThe last thing but not least : the location is great. It is just 5 minutes walk from the Dam place.You're not far from the red light district (just after the Dam place) but the hotel location is safe and there are no people shouting! I would recommend it if you are searching an hotel not too expensive but clean and well located.

<Content>Clean budget hotel; bring a light suitcase! Hotel Aspen is a clean, basic, budget hotel. No frills whatsoever. No TV, no radio. (Phone, yes.) The towels were tiny and scratchy, and the shower basically worked. But overall, the hotel and the room were clean and tidy, and fairly quiet (especially if you use earplugs to block some of the street noise, if your room is in the front of the building facing the street). Rooms at the back of the building seemed much quieter.But beware: the stairs are challenging, so if you stay here, I hope you have a small, light suitcase! One person in our party notoriously overpacks, which she did again this time. Getting her bag up the staircase was difficult, to say the least.The location is pretty convenient. Avoid the pancake house a couple of doors down: terrible food, outrageous prices. For a great meal, go to the absolutely gorgeous public library (across a small bridge from Centraal Station)--which also boasts more than 100 free Internet terminals. The restaurant is on the top floor of the library, and it's AMAZING. Seriously, it's not to be missed.We also liked Bagels and Beans up the street (opens at 9 am) and the little restaurant a couple of doors up on the corner (can't recall the name).By the way, it's easiest to get around town on foot, since most of the attractions are close enough to walk to without difficulty. The tram is OK, but it can be a bit confusing if you are accustomed to a subway-type system.

<Content>The value for money choice in Amsterdam At 鈧?0 per night this place cannot be faulted for single room accomodation - single bed,sink, clean towels and wardrobe. No TV or coffee making facilities provided. Do not let the shared toilet/shower facilities for single rooms put you off as this place is clean, centrally located and offers real value for money for the budget conscious traveller. Situated just 5 mins walk from Dam square and 12/15 mins walk (walking is no problem with a light holdall to avoid the 鈧?5 cab fare) from Amsterdam Central station. Cash on arrrival is required for payment and you need to vacate the room by 10am on day of departure. In summary, for a weekend away with your mates this hotel is ideal and offers reak value for money for a city where hotels can be pricey.

<Content>Amsterdams little jewel A friend and I stayed at Hotel Aspen from 8/8 dep 11/8 in a twin sized room. The room was very large and the bathroom just as large (be careful about the step leading to the bathroom in Rm.2 as I tripped into the bathroom several times..haha). I loved our large bay window with window seat. It was a nice place to sit and relax after a long day. The owner was very friendly and always available to answer any questions. He was there to greet us every night as we climbed our way up the steep stairs. We read about the hotel on several websites and were well prepared for the steep staircase, which was a bit daunting at first. I will admit I was slightly nervous about how we were going to get our luggage back down the stairs upon departure, but we managed!!The location of the hotel was great, close proximity to the Anne Frank House, Dam Square and all the other sites of interest in Amsterdam. Plus, it is close to Central Station!! The downside to the hotel might have to be the small single beds. Mine was slightly lopsided and I felt like I would fall off of it on a few occasions. One recommendation might be to provide plastic cups that are wrapped in plastic instead of unwrapped plastic cups being left in the bathroom. With that said I would still happily stay at Hotel Aspen again and will recommend it to others (who are fit and healthy to cope with the stairs) as the price and location outweighed anything that might have been negative. There is a fairly large grocery store on the corner near the hotel so a great place to stock up on water and snacks, which will help to save money. However the cafe's are all really nice with reasonable prices. My new favorite store has also got to be Hema! Loved it!!!

<Content>very close to everything, good room and showers! We stayed in Amsterdam for 1 day in the begging of June of this year: my mother over 50 years old (very physically active), my 20 year old sis and myself. I must stay it鈥檚 about 10-15 min walk from Central station so there is no need to take a cab (just a waste of money). Print off the area map from Google and there you go. As other people said the stairs are very steep! Just be careful!Room was ok. We got the quadruple room as the hotel doesn鈥檛 have triple rooms, I think, not sure. We had private shower. Water pressure was good; shower was sparkling clean as well as the room. We got the room on the third floor with windows facing the back of the house in the quite neighborhood. The mattress was very comfortable especially after a lot of walking. I would stay in this hotel again if we get a chance to go see Amsterdam.Btw, take a canal bus tour. It鈥檚 around 18 euros but it鈥檚 much worth it cause you can hop on and off as you want.

<Content>Cheap, good location - functional Hotels in Amsterdam are expensive - you have got to deal with it, with that in mind this place is very, very good value. We paid 80 Euros for a 4 bed en-suite. We were over for a sports tournament, and weren't going to be hanging around too much so it suited our needs well.I didn't find our room particularly cramped, though it isn't big, and the beds are fairly narrow (I fell out of it one night! But it isn't too high off the floor so it didn't matter!) and the room and en-suite shower/toilet are clean. The location is very central for everything with a tram stop very close that goes up to Central Station, Spui, Leidseplein (all within walkin distance anyway) and the Museumplein, and only a couple of minutes walk from Dam Square. It is also, though on a fairly busy road, very close to one of the prettier canal areas in Amsterdam - just walk up or down Prinsengracht, Keizergracht or Herengracht and the street between them and you'll find traditional homes, boutique shops, canal-side cafes and little bars and restaurants - you are also very close to the atmospheric local Jordaan area.That said, it isn't luxury, there is no breakfast, the stairs are very steep by international standards and there is no other way up (but by no means very steep by Amsterdam standards), there isn't anything in the way of facilities but none of this botheres me.The dude behind the desk was a little odd (he'd gone rifling though my bag because my phone was ringing whilst I was out - which I wasn't too keen on).Seemed quite an international bunch staying there - only 4 or 5 rooms I think.

<Content>Very good for the price / Excellent proprietors I stayed at the Hotel Aspen in November of 2006 in order to attend a music function in Amsterdam that lasted through a weekend. I knew I wouldn't be spending too much time at my hotel room, so I wanted something utilitarian (but clean), close to the city center and, yes, not too expensive.The Hotel Aspen fit the bill perfectly and provided a bit more. It's within walking distance (approx. 1 mile) of the Central Rail Station and close to everything in the City Center. The proprietor (unfortunately I didn't write down his name) couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. When I checked in, he immediately provided me with a great walking map of Amsterdam and spent quite a while talking with me about what I wanted to do and the best ways to do it. Both he and his wife treated me extremely well and made me feel right at home.Everything was squeaky clean, including the shared bathroom. I am used to traveling in Europe, so I know that for the price range we are talking about here, you're going to get a tiny room, shared bath, etc. If you want an American-style hotel room, it's going to cost a LOT more than the Aspen, so don't expect luxury. For the single traveller, such as me, who needs a home base from which to enjoy the city, it's perfect.You will probably read a lot about the steep stairs here. It's true, the stairs are well, awesomely steep. However, that's they way it is in almost every building I saw in Amsterdam, and I learned to negotiate them after a short time. I was also travelling quite light - if you have a problem getting around, or are carrying lots of baggage, the stairs might very well be a problem.For the price (Amsterdam is an enormously expensive city, hotel-wise), I can't imagine getting a better deal than the Aspen provided - highly recommended for the practical traveller!

<Content>Cheap and cheery! If you're looking for a clean, safe, conveniently located, friendly, budget-minded hotel, and you'll be staying in Amsterdam ;-) , this hotel should be in your consideration set. After all, you probably won't be staying in the room all that long anyway. Like many city hotels, the stairs are steep and there isn't a lift but if you're nice the owner/operator will probably offer to help you with your bags. Don't expect the Ritz, but I suppose you already know that.

<Content>Good budget option in Amsterdam This is a superbly located small backpacker type hotel just a couple of minutes walk from Dam square. It was very basic (with the double bed being closer to 3 quarter size and the room being smaller than anything else we stayed in in Europe) but clean and tidy, which was exactly what we wanted after getting of the plane after a 12 hour flight. The steep stairs were not a problem for us but I can see how they could be for someone older or with heavy suitcases (we had packs). The shared shower was clean and always free when we wanted it but was literally located in a cupboard in the hallway. The price seemed a little steep for such basic accommodation at 60 euros per night (plus 5% tax - a hidden cost), especially compared with lovely renovated hotels we stayed at in places like Paris and Bordeaux however I agree that it is excellent for Amsterdam - most places are in need of renovation and bedrooms are uniformly tiny. The owner was very helpful and gave good advice and service.Whilst something bigger, newer and cheaper would have been great, I would still stay here again as I know that Amsterdam is small, old and expensive, and the excellent location makes this hotel stand out amongst a mediocre bunch.

<Content>great small hotel we stayed at the Aspen after I read the reviews on trip advisor,it lived up to all the praise. In a fantastic location for the wjole of Amsterdam the hotel was clean and the manager very friendly. I would say the only real downside was the stairs which were amazingly steep but at least we've now got healthy leg muscles!overall a lovely little hotel, we would definitley stay again.

<Content>Hotel Aspen overall is nice. Hotel Aspen is in a great location. The gentleman whom let us in to the hotel was informative and helpful he gave us great ideas of what to do while in Amsterdam. The hotel was clean but there was no air conditioning. Also the stairs in this hotel were Very steep. Be careful!

<Content>Good Value for Money There were 4 of us staying in the Quad Room (Room 2) and the beds were very comfortable and very clean. They are quite narrow beds so if you're a large size you may struggle. The shower was hot although not a lot of pressure but it got you clean - what more could you want! Got quite chilly in the room in the afternoon as there was no heating switched on but we didnt spend alot of time in there anyway. Great location quite close to everything although when we arrived we took a taxi from the station as it was raining and it only cost 9 euros for 4 of us. The owner was a lovely friendly and helpful man, always smiling. On the downside, it would have been nice if there had been coffee or tea making facilities especially if like me all you want in a morning is a cuppa, plenty of sockets though so take a kettle with you. And the stairs are killers!!! Thank goodness our room was on the second floor I dont think I could have made it any further - but its Amsterdam so what more can you expect. If you're on a budget I would definitely recommend Hotel Aspen.

<Content>twin room Clean, yes, but the twin beds were too small. Aprox 60 cm wide, even for a average peron. We had to move the beds and sleep comfortable on the matrass on the floor, because I found myself on the floor during the night when i tried the bed. Shower was not good, no pressure. We wanted to leave the first night after we saw the double room we've booked, reason: The room with the double bed was found too depressing by us, and the bedsize was suitable for one and a half person. We were told that the cancelation rate was one night anyway if you cancel within 48 hours. So we were forced to stay in the twin room with shower and toilet after our discussion that we couldn't spend the night in the tiny double bedroom.I must say that the website looked more appealing than in reality.

<Content>Great deal for the independent traveller I travelled to Amsterdam on my own as a break from my friends in Germany in the autumn of 2005. I found the Hotel Aspen in the guide book I bought and had no idea what to expect when I reserved a single room with shared bath. As I made the quick 15 minute walk from Amsterdam's Central Station, I realized that Hotel Aspen was situated in one of the nicer neighborhoods of Amsterdam. The hotel's location seemed central to everything you'd want to do  see in Amsterdam. My room was clean and well-lit, and just the right size for a single traveller. The shared bathroom was cleaned continuously throughout the day. All the staff were very nice  helpful and the owner was an incredibly nice man who was always there with a smile and a friendly greeting. I highly recommend staying at this hotel if you want a great value in Amsterdam. When I return to Amsterdam in spring 2006, I will certainly stay at the Hotel Aspen.

<Content>A good budget choice We stayed in room number 2 - a quad room. The room was light and airy and a good size. It was away from the road and very quiet. The bathroom was much larger than I've had in other Amsterdam budget hotels. This seems to be a family run establishment and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a low cost hotel in the centre of Amsterdam I would seriously recommend you think of booking Hotel Aspen.One negative point - 2 of the 3 who stayed in our room were bitten quite badly by some kind of insect. We didn't see any mosquitos flying around - not unusual for October - but we were bitten by something in the room.

<Content>Wonderful experience Excellent rooms and service for a budget hotel. The staff was very accomodating, helpful and friendly. We had a group of 7 people and stayed in 2 doubles and a triple at the beginning of September for 3 nights. We had our own bathroom in each of the rooms, and everything was very clean. Our rooms were very spacious. The walk was only about 15 minutes from the train station, with our backpacks. You can't get a better location than this. Dam Square (what I consider to be in the middle of everything) is just a couple of blocks away. The street car goes right past the front of the hotel (which can be a bit noisy if staying in the front side of the hotel with the windows open).There were quite a few stairs, but not so bad after you don't have your luggage with you. We had backpacks, so not a problem for us at all, just take them slow. Overall a great experience. Hotel Aspen is the place I will stay whenever I return to Amsterdam.

<Content>No nonsense hotel I travel to experience a new place and not a hotel in a new place; so I prefer hotels that provide just the basis necessities at a good price and are clean and safe. Aspen met all my conditions. Plus it is at a great location: Rijksmuseum, Dam Square, Anne Frank House are all within 15 minutes of walking distance. If you know better than bigger is better, you would love this place. And yes, you will remember the tall stairway too, but which place in Amsterdam doesn't have those? I will definitely go back to Aspen.

<Content>Good, but not great value I stayed in Room #8, a very small single room, from 22-26 june 2005. Yes, this is a no frills hotel, centrally situated, cheap and clean (I got new towels every day!), but if your room faces the Raadhuisstraat, as did mine, it is definitely not quiet during warm summer nights.

<Content>Good Value- Good Location Good location within short walking distance of Dam Square, Centraal Station and Anne Frank House. The room was simple (no tv or phone) but very clean and quiet (we had rear facing room). We were there for three nights in late April 2005 during the Queen's Day Celebration and had no trouble with noise. The room had four single beds (for two adults and two kids) and attached private shower/bathroom. Very friendly staff (Esam) helped to make our first visit to Amsterdam a true pleasure. Would highly recommend for those looking for a clean, cost effective lodging alternative with no frills (be aware that the stairs to the rooms are steep- hard to manuever with large/heavy luggage).

<Content>Great find! This is definitely a great find for Amsterdam. Very affordable rates, the owners were very nice and helpful and it is in a great location. The beds were very very comfortable - something I was very grateful for after walking all day around the city. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Perfect location, great price I stayed in a single at the Hotel Aspen for 5 nights in early April. It fulfilled all of my requirements for a hotel: clean, comfortable bed, convenient location, and good price. At the Aspen, you get the added bonus of Esam, the proprietor, who is always willing to offer restaurant and transportation suggestions as well as the weather forecast, maps, and umbrellas. Quite the character! The hotel is walking distance to Centraal Station and all of the major sights. My room was tiny but spotless, and the shared bathroom and shower were literally right outside my door (and never once occupied when I needed it). I was also rather giddy to discover that I had my very own gargoyle just outside the window. The only downside has been mentioned by others before me: THE STAIRS--I'll be seeing those stairs in my nightmares for years to come. But, hey, it's good exercise and it's the perfect justification to have another pannenkoeken with cream!

<Content>Decent hotel once you climb all the stairs After walking a mile through the snow to get to this hotel, we open the door to see tiny stairs as far as the eye can see! We drag out luggage up to the clerk, who informs us that our room is yet another two flights up! This hotel is definitely not for those of us who pack heavy, but it was a huge room, very clean, and in a good location.I'd stay again, but only if I packed much much lighter!

<Content>So friendly, but whoa the stairs! Fantastic for the price! When we checked in everything was good, we got a map showing different areas such as nightclubs, markets, red light etc. Room was tiny, but had a lovely outlook - anyway in Amsterdam there is something wrong if you are spending much time in your room! Not once in our 3 day stay was the shared toilet or shower (tiny cubicle room, nowhere to put clothes) occupied. By the 3rd night we weren't even bothering to get dressed to go to the loo!Overall, great value for 42 euro a night, handy to everything, and a great walk to red light/centraal (up a big shopping street - yeah!)
