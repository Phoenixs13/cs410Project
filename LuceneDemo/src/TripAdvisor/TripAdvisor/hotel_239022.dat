<Content>Gret hotel The night from the 7th till the 8th of november I stayed in this hotel.I needed some quality time to spend with one of my 3 sons.My first impression that I got when I came in , was a warm welcome.The lobby made me think of a living room where you want to come home to.Home, that鈥檚 the word I鈥檓 looking for. That鈥檚 the overall feeling I got during my stay.Friendly staff. All of them walk that extra mile to make your stay a nice one.The room we had was romantic, clean and had everything we needed. The reason we choose this hotel was that the information told us it was located near all the sights we wanted to see. This, together with the reasonable price made us decide to stay there.Breakfast was a buffet with different kinds of food. My son especially liked the dutch pancakes.Staff took more then enough time to explain to us the sights to be seen. They even pointed out a restaurant (just around the corner) where we had a perfect dinner for a good price.I think the name was Plancius.We鈥檒l be back for sure. Maybe around Christmas with the whole familly. Then I think I鈥檒l take the familly room they have. I鈥檝e seen that one also . All the rooms there seem to have another look.Warm, welcome, honest, clean and especially very friendly.See you soon again Rembrandt! Thanks for a great stay.

<Content>Loved The Hotel Me and my husband visited this hotel and absolutely loved it.We were here for our 5 year anniversary and we got a complimentary bottle of wine!When the room wasn't ready at our arrival we could leave our luggage at the reception and we got espresso.The prices are good considering you are in the center of the city and comparing it to other hotels(which are often more expensive for what you get).The room was very nice and clean and the bathroom was great!Staff was real friendly and knew a lot of Amsterdam.They recommended very good restaurants and made reservations for us.The only downside was that the toiletpaper and towels were forgotten to change one day but they immediately gave us those things, and the breakfast was only untill 10.00 o'clock.Would definitely go there again!!

<Content>not for business people If you are in Amsterdam for business dont stay here. this is not a business hotel with printer, elevator and the normal standards. it looks like is a low budget hotel but is actually quite expensive for what it is. the hotel does a great job with pictures from the rooms on their website and you get a feel that this is a cool boutique hotel. it is not. Beware!

<Content>Loved Amsterdam I have just come back from a stay at this lovely hotel, i was a bit dubious but am so glad that i went for the small , family run hotel instead of a big chain , it added to the amsterdam experience....The staff are really friendly and give you lots of useful tourist info and nothing is too much trouble...we had room 17 which was up 5 flights but this didnt bother us (usually i would moan) as it felt like our own floor in the attic, the room was a tiny bit dated but this added to the overall charm and they have everything you need and the beds are the most comfortbale EVER!!The location of the hotel is really good its alot more resisdential but there is a few bars, a coffee shop, an atm all in 1 mins walk and the tram stop is right outside the hotel. Tram number 9 takes you into the centre within 5 mins and also rembrandplien in 2 mins where you will find a more classy side to the city with chic bars , clubs and resturants , this can all be easily walked though if you dont want to get a tram...all in all we choose this hotel as the price was really really good compared to the other hotels in the are we paid 145 each for 3 nights ina large double room , that was how much the other hotels were asking per night!!I would definatley stay here again, usually i like being in the main area when i go away being a young twenty something but if i did there were parts of amsterdam i wouldnt of found the hotel area is really nice , theres a little park, a canal and even a zoo!!!

<Content>Nice hotel in good safe location I have just returned from this hotel and had a great stay. Cannot understand the previous review re smoking as this is a non smoking hotel and they definitley do not allow it!We had a huge room which was very clean. Towels changed every day. Mini bar was very reasonable prices.Trams stop outside the hotel . We bought a 3 day pass which cost us 14 euros from Central station.There are some very good bars and restaurants close to the hotel and were much cheaper than in the centre.The hotel is looking very drab in places, yet still retains such lovely character.

<Content>convenient but very smoky! Clean, excellent location, spacious room. But big problem--we are not smlkers. Guests and employees hung out in the library/fromt sitting room constantly smoking. Drifted up the stairs. Our room, the hallway, downstairs, everywhere reeked thickly from the smoke. Drove us crazy! My kids were constantly coughing. Also, about the breakfast: The breakfast room was really very cool. But the spread left to be desired. Nothing particularly home made or delicious, just standard store-bought goods. By the end of our trip, we skipped it entirely even though we paid for it.Although it did have some good qualities, i would not return to this hotel.

<Content>Priced well for quiet city central hotel - Rembrandt Hotel Good breakfasts. Comfortable rooms with television, plenty of hot water, a grand room for Breakfast. Very close to the city center and right along the metro line. Getting to and from the main station is less than ten minutes with the streetcar.

<Content>Great value, decent stay! We found our stay in Amsterdam to be amazing. This Hotel was reasonably priced and we had no problems with it. All the staff spoke English and were a massive help. The Library and Breakfast room are lovely. Some of the decoration is a little tired in places, but you are there to see the city, not spend all your time in the Hotel!If you are looking for a cheap stay and looking to avoid a hostel i reccommend this Hotel. The trams outside are very frequent making the Hotel very accessible. The only negative was the towels. They were quite small and thin. Que Sera Sera!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I stayed in this hotel in 2002. After searching online for weeks I fell in love with the look and feel of the hotel on their website. At that time the price was about half the price now and included breakfast. I stayed in the single room and it was large enough and quite comfortable. The bathroom was incredible, spotlessly clean and looked as if it had just been remodeled. I loved the wood floors, much better than carpet. The staff was polite and the lobby cozy with all the books and chairs positioned by the windows. My friend, a native of the Netherlands, came to visit me there and also liked the hotel. The only down side I saw was there is no lift and the stairs are quite steep and the location is a bit far from Central Station, but still within walking distance. I had severe jet lag while I was there and could not get to sleep at night as my room faced the street and the tram track, but it was nice to look out at the pedestrians. I would highly recommend Rembrandt Hotel and will probably stay there again myself in spring of 2009. This hotel beats everything else I've seen online even if a bit higher I think it's well worth it.

<Content>Great hotel I stayed at Rembrandt on December 31 - January 5 and very much liked this hotel. I must admit that my first impression was not the best though and it turned out to be wrong. What I found positive about this hotel is that its location is very good, it's situated close to the city center and you can either walk or take a tram (tram stop is just a hundred steps away from the hotel door) to get there. It's quietness and safety that you appreciate so much after spending time in crazy city center. First night I stayed in a double room, it was not that spacious but had everything one might need in it. The rest of nights I spent in a single room as requested and this room was very nice, more spacious, had a very clean bathroom and a very large window which I liked too. The only thing I wasn't comfortable with was kinda dark light, just would have prefered to feel the difference between room with light on and off. Breakfast was ok, there was all kinds of food you need in the morning, and yes, coffee was great. Of course dining room was amazing, it looked like an antique one. Unfortunately I didn't get much information from the staff on the building and dining room history, so have no idea if it's a genuine one but will keep thinking it is))). It was my first (and I hope not the last) trip to Amsterdam and I have no other hotel experience in this city but if I go there next time I wouldn't mind staying in this hotel again.

<Content>great hotel Me and my husband had a great stay at the hotel this November. The room was small, but had everything we needed, the bed - comfortable and the bathroom - very clean. The desighn of the room was already mentioned - sunflowers everywhere, which, for us personally, gave a very bright feeling every time we looked at it. The breakfast room - great, the food - all that can be needed, and the coffee - excellent. The staff was really more than nice, they helped us greatly, and we are very greatful to them for all they did. We are seriously hoping to stay at the same room at this hotel when we are next in town.

<Content>Friendly, curteous, clean and accommodating My boyfriend and I stayed at the Rembarndt late May for a week. We had never been to the Netherlands before so it was a new experience for us and we had no idea what location would be best for us. The hotel is in a great location about a 5 minute walk to Mac Bikes, for bike rental. Just around the corner from the Zoo and about again 5 minutes from the grocery store. The staff were very helpful and new english perfectly. The called our cab when we were leaving for the airport and knocked on our door to make sure we were up in time. The breakfast area was beautiful and the food was fresh and tasty. No bacon or eggs just good healthy food like fruit and assortment of cheese and ham and fresh bread. Cearl with milk or yougurt, boiled eggs and fresh coffee or tea.The room was a little run down and could probably use a little rennovations but for what we paid it was well worth it. Our room was a small double with a large window looking over on the backyard, you cold open the windows fully and step outside on a small balcony. The bathroom was great, clean and newly rennovated.Be warned that most channels on the Tv were in Dutch, which is understandable, but if you wanted to watch movies in English then you had to pay but it was fairly inexpensive. They came in and cleaned everyday and left fresh bags for coffee and clean towels.Overall for the price that you pay it is really worth it.

<Content>Quaint and practical, convenient to transportation and attractions My husband and I stayed here for 10 days in early April (work and vacation) and were pleased with the service and the facilities. Though it's a hotel, it felt more like a bed and breakfast, which was a nice surprise.When we got off the tram, I thought the place looked a bit shady with its overgrown unruly ivy, but the inside was just fine, warm and welcoming. We started in a small double in the basement or ground floor (hollywood theme) -- all yellow with basic furnishings, great bathroom and no problems except no windows to open for fresh air and unfortunate proximity to a room where a guest was smoking. There was a door leading out to the backyard, but we couldn't sleep with that open, as there wasn't a screen.We were later able to switch to a smaller small double right next to the breakfast room (the sunflower room). Though it was a tighter squeeze, we enjoyed having windows, lots of light and fresh air and a view of the backyard.Breakfast was pleasant and ample and offered in the hotel's flagship room. Rooms were cleaned each day and staff members were helpful. The location is quiet and residential but still convenient to public transportation, a cash machine and two quite good cafes for nights when you don't want to head to more tourist-laden areas. Waterlooplein is a 10-minute walk and other areas are not much farther. The hotel is next to a school, so the crowds of students may be a surprise if you happen to be there midday.But overall, a pleasant place for travelers who don't need luxury but can appreciate practical, clean, convenient and quaint quarters.

<Content>Treat with caution We decided to stay at the Rembrandt partly because it was one of the few hotels available over the bank holiday and because it had a very good write up in a travel guide; which now leaves me slightly suspicious that the author of the guide didn't actually put his foot inside the door. This is a worn hotel, in the corridors the wall paper needs a good lick of paint, the carpet is thread bare and its all seen better days. We'd booked a small double and were apologetically told when arriving that the double bed in the room was very small and we'd be moved to a bigger room the next day at no extra cost. We were presented with what looked like a large single bed in a room which was a homage to chip board and wood effect all rounded off with laminate floors that could have fooled no one. The whole room looked like a hostel on Earls Court Road. To be fair, the bathroom was clean and modern and obviously recently refurbished ( but why stop there...) Although this appears a quiet area by day its really noisy by night.The next day, as promised, we were moved into a bright double room with a little terrace over looking a rather wild garden. If you are offered a small double; I would ensure that it is one on the web site; the one we were allocated was dire.In terms of location its about a 15 ish minute walk to DAM square and about 25 to the station, but its a rather nothingy, dull area, lacking any buzz and the sort of scenes that make you want to visit Amsterdam in the first place.

<Content>If you want to sleep, get a room in the rear........ Nice big Family room for 5. Second floor loft for the kids. Nice breakfast room.Now the bad news, if you don't mind Trolly's at all hours of the night 50' from your room this is for you. Loud, Loud, Loud.We left after 2 nights out of 4 and went to the Best Western down the street.

<Content>Don't stay in the basement! Beware - there are no pictures of the 'small double' on the website - they are all the nice larger ones which cost 25% more.The one we got was in the converted basement and the smell of damp as you walked down to the room was very off putting. Our room had a 'garden' leading of it - more of a mass of weeds but at least it was fresh air as there are no other windows.The decor in the room was actually quite nice - all IKEA style  halogen lights but there was a sense that it was hurriedly and cheaply put together. The laminate flooring had not been finished off properly at the edges hence numerous small creatures that are attracted to damp such as spiders and wood lice would congregate there. Worst of all however was discovering a insect similar to a silverfish in the bed!The tea/coffe making facilities are a good idea but the layer of dust over the teabags and coffee sachets put me off using them. The bathroom was compact but newly done and the shower was blissfull. The service was mixed depending on who was on duty - one of the days it was appalling as no one was on hand at breakfast for half an hour so no coffee or tea was available and no re-fills of other food could be asked for. When someone did turn up they seemed annoyed about it!Overall this hotel has the potential to be a really nice place if only a bit of extra effort was made - in the meantime I'd avoid the basement rooms!

<Content>Clean and basic My husband and I stayed at Hotel Rembrandt for four nights in early November. The furnishings are basic, a little worn, but everything seems very clean. There is absolutely no smattering of luxury at this hotel. Our room, while spacious, was very beige, empty, echo-y and cold. The towels were worn thin and the toilet ran all the time. The hotel staff were generally very pleasant, but in a forced sort of way. The location is good, however. All the action is just a 10-minute walk away (whatever action you prefer!). The zoo and Hortus are practically right next door. Since we prefer a tad more service and comfort when we travel, we'll probably stay somewhere else on our next trip. But I would still recommend it to someone looking for basic accommodations at a good price.
