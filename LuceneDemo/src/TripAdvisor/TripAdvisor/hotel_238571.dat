<Content>GOOD service, clean, basic, best part of Amsterdam 5 friends, women 40+, just returned from 3 Nights at Hotel Hoksbergen. The hotel is in 4 flours, with 14 rooms. We were looking for a basic place just in this area ( lots of nice bars, restaurants, shops, silent streets, few cars, a good view to the Singel canal, everything in walking distance.) Hoksbergen had it all.  In our Lonely planet guide it says that; even sardines would have trouble squising into the microscopically small rooms; We are large womens from scandinavia and managed well; Service is good, beds are good, steps are steep, always good for heart!. Breakfast was good, the coffee could have been better, thats our only complain. We would all go back, next time with our husbands and childrens, knowing that we will be having another exellent stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Extremely basic When we arrived it looked so nice from the outside, great location on a canal. The reception area was small but we just wanted to see the room. We were given room 1, straight up the stairs!!! Upon walking in it was tiny, it was a box room, the toilet next door was bigger! So my partner went straight downstairs and lied about it being my birthday and it was meant to be a romantic holiday. We were meant to be there for 3 nights but the man behind the counter was very understanding and let us stay just 1 night and we found somewhere else for the remaining 2 nights. It would be fine for 1 night quick stay but not for a romantic break. It was 98 Euros that is expensive for what you get, we went to a 4 star the remaining 2 nights for the same price.

<Content>An OK hotel for Amsterdam For Amsterdam this was a reasonably priced hotel, but the rooms are a little dated. I would stop here again but I do think its a little overpriced for what you get (which I guess is true for any hotel in Amsterdam). The breakfast I thought was excellent but the stairs are very steep and if you have any mobility problmes this is not the hotel for you.It is centrally located and easy to find, its only 5 minutes walk from Dam square and assuming that you haven't much luggage is walkable from the Central Station. I found the owners/ staff very friendly.

<Content>A fabulous find! I haven't been to the Hoksbergen since January 06, but i must say that i'm surprised at the majority of the reviews... i found he hotel wonderful...the food was just fine, the reception was very warm, though i do agree that they had no idea of any tourist information... but you can find all that elsewhere easily. the rooms were totally outdated, but clean and the beds were made every day. the stairs were steep, but c'mon people, this is an old city... an old hotel...not the mariott... anyway, i thought the location was excellent and like it so much that i'm thinking of going back there this may. This time I have a group and will probably choose an apartment. Does anyone know if the owners/proprietors have changed since 2006? Just wondering.

<Content>the hoksbergen Hi allI have stayed in the hoksbergen a few timesi have to say its basic but comfortable rooms are small but very clean witch is the main thing with me. staff i found very pleasent and alwasy rember us when we go back and they always give us a discount when we go back to them. its located in a great a quite street one small street away from dam square bars restaruants and ngt life. the main shopping street is just a 4 min walk away so is the museums redlight and coffee shops. the one and only problem i had with this hotel is the stairs they are very steep and hard on the legs if you on top floor (witch we always get lol) other than that ive no probs with it if your just looking for a budget hotel been to others that were cheaper but they were out of the way and were dumps. one thing about the hoksbergens location is it very safe

<Content>No major problems This hotel is not for everyone, but it worked for my husband and me. Let's start with the negative aspects. The room was extremely small - we had about 2 feet of floor space between the bed and the walls - barely enough room for our suitcase. But, we were not shocked by this as the owners (Xia/Bruno/Bert) had explained that the rooms were small.They also explained that the stairs were very steep. They are a little scary to be honest, and climbing them was a workout. If you have physical limitations or are in poor health, you will have a difficult time with the stairs. The bathroom was also very small - I am 5' 3 and my knees touched the wall when I sat on the toilet. The last negative - the mattress was not very comfortable. It was not unbearable. Again, if you have back problems or need an excellent mattress, stay at another hotel.Now for the positives - we knew all the possible issues before we ever arrived at the Hoksbergen because the owners were very honest about their hotel. I asked a lot of questions and you should too, regardless of where you stay.The room was very clean and was made up every morning. The bedspread was old but clean, and the sheets were crisp and white. I am very picky in this area and did not have any issue.The breakfast was similar to an American continental breakfast. There was coffee, tea, toast, boiled eggs, lunchmeat and cheese, fruit, cereal, etc. It's included in the room price. The canal view is beautiful! The windows open wide and you can sit on the large windowsill and relax. There are pretty flower boxes on the windows too - a nice touch. Lastly, the owners were efficient and helpful. They called for a taxi when we asked, helped with directions, and recommended restaurants. I recommend emailing the hotel and asking any questions in advance so you know what to expect. That's the key to a happy stay!

<Content>No redeeming qualities We booked this because it was the only reasonably priced hotel available at the time. Warning: you get what you pay for here. The check in people were clueless about any tourist info we requested. The stairs were extremely steep and no elevator. The entire hotel reeked of smoke (not just cigarettes) and it was loud. The rooms were the smallest I've ever seen, same goes for bathroom. Would not recommend unless you are young, broke and enjoy smoking. The breakfast was acceptable (I had to say something positive!)

<Content>Disappointed by Hoksbergen My husband and I stayed at Hotel Hoksbergen for 4 nights at the end of September 2007. Upon arriving, I was quite charmed by the location and exterior of the hotel, the entry/breakfast room was also quaint. The man who checked us in however, was mildly unpleasant. Although there was another man who helped us throughout our stay who was quite friendly.The biggest disappointment came upon opening the door to our room, after walking up two flights of steep stairs. The room was stark, but not in a modern sense. It seemed to date from the 70's, the walls were plain for the most part. The linens appeared to date from the 70s, yet were not tattered. The biggest surprise came when we pulled back the bedspread to find a fleece blanket with a tiger printed across it, with a mysterious brownish stain towards the top. The bathroom was covered with brown linoleum and smelled too strongly of toilet disinfectant. We seriously considered finding a new hotel the next day. We decided against it primarily because the room was basically clean and comfortable and our primary objections were about the decor, or lack thereof. The breakfast was fine and included a choice of coffee or tea, breads, sandwich meats, cereal, among other simple choices. The location was the saving grace of this hotel, located on the Spui and within easy walking distance of all locations within the historic area of town. This was not my first choice of hotels to book when planning our trip, but I soon found that the other 10 or so hotels I was considering were booked. I spent more on this hotel per night than any others during our trip to Europe (London, Brugge, Paris), which added an extra sting to my disappointment with the room. Despite our accommodations, we fell in love with Amsterdam. If we are lucky enough to visit Amsterdam in the future, we will plan well in advance and will not book at Hotel Hoksbergen.

<Content>Worst value ever! Dirty and small! This place is a dump! Rude people own it and they treat their customers, especially Americans, like garbage. 8 of us went to Amsterdam on separate flights for a bachelor party; we were to meet up at the Hoksbergen, which is where we were all staying. We had two rooms. I was with the bachelor and one other friend when we arrived at the hotel. We checked in and asked the man for our friends room so we could meet up (there are two separate buildings, a few blocks apart, we stayed in separate ones and did not know where the other was). He told us no, he would not give it away b/c he didn't like people like us (mid 20 year olds) hanging out in groups in Amsterdam. None of us had cell phone or any form of communication. We pleaded with the man to at least call their room and tell them we arrived, he said no. When we came back an hour later he said our friends were making noise and he told them to be quiet - but did not mention a word about us arriving. We were never able to meet up with them for the three days we were there. The place was a rip off. The rooms (ours for three people) was about 8x8 with three tiny beds about an inch think mattress covered in plastic. There were insects all over the room and cigarette butts on the floor. The bathroom was far too small to fit in - aside from its microscopic area it had a 5 - 1/2 foot ceiling; literally, I鈥檓 6 foot and could not stand up in it. Of course no A/C, which we were, told there was. We refused to stay there, left and stayed at a real nice hotel right in front of the train station. This was in a better location, was a real hotel, unlike the Hoksbergen hostel, and was less than the Hoksbergen. Do yourself a favor and don鈥檛 stay at the Hoksbergen, there are way too many nice hotels in Amsterdam with a much better value and experience.

<Content>great location Hoksbergen is excellently located along the pretty Singel canal. Unfortunately, our room faced the back, and Spui is a noisy street. There was also an active construction site directly below the window. The room (luckily, on the first floor, up just one flight of narrow stairs) was small, with two single beds pushed together. The beds were fairly comfortable, seemed to be thick foam mattesses. The very tiny bathroom has a decent shower, with plenty of hot water, but they use some sort of perfumey disinfectant cake in the toilet that made the entire room reek. The lighting in the room is terrible, and there is basically no decor to speak of (tho there is a flat-panel TV on the wall). And it could have been a little cleaner. Breakfast was nothing special; the coffee was okay. (There's a good bakery and a sandwich/breakfast place right around the corner.) The hotel staff were pleasant .It's pretty much what you'd expect for the money: adequate, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than a couple of nights.

<Content>you can get a lot more for your money elsewhere... i have stayed in Amsterdam a few times and this hotel is the worst value for money i have stayed in yet. As a budget traveller my expectations are never very high but i have stayed in far nicer and cheaper hotels than this.I booked a double room for me and my husband. However when we arrived at the hotel we were given a twin room. we were told we could just push the beds next to each other but this was impossible as there was a door in the way! the man on reception made no effort to help us and consequently we were stuck in separate beds for the night- not that nice for a couple who have only been married for a few months!The room itself was incredibley pokey and for the price of 98 euros an absolute rip off!My advice to any traveller on a budget is to head for Hotel Brouwer up the road where it's 90 euros for a great large double room with old wooden beams and a great breakfast.Also Hotel Acacia in the Joordan is miles better than Hotel Hoksbergen at 80 euros for a big double bedroom with a canal view.If you're absolutely pushed go here but there are so many more better budget options than this about!

<Content>what a find!!! I was so lucky to find this apt hotel. I went to Amsterdam with 5 teenagers and me (the Mom). Being all together in one place instead of having to get separate rooms was wonderful. This hotel exceeded our expectations. The reception was super friendly and since my credit card had expired since I made my reservation they still held my room til I got there late in the afternoon. There is no elevator, but you don麓t expect one in the canal house hotels. That was part of the fun for us those steep steps....The apt was clean and equipt with everything we needed. There was a separate room with a dbl bed and 4 beds set up in the sitting area. The room was airconditioned. We had a kitchen with all the utensils and a okay size bathroom. The faucet broke while we were there and the staff handled it quickly and efficiently. We were centrally located. I totally recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Ups and Downs I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in July. Upon my arrival early in the morning my room was not yet ready but I was allowed to sit in the dining room and enjoy a simple breakfast. Several hours later the room was ready. It was a very small room but had all necessities. Sleeping was very uncomfortable. I found the bed to be very hot not because of the blankets or the weather but because of the plastic mattress cover. The hotel is in a great location and has easy access to public transit and attractions. I checked out on a Sunday morning but was told that I could leave my luggage at the hotel until Monday evening. My luggage was brought down for me. When I returned to the hotel Monday evening the man working at the desk was extremely rude to me. He was speaking to me in a voice that was full of sarcasm. He told me no one knew to whom the luggage belonged as I had just left the hotel without telling anyone. I explained to him that I had spoken to the other hotel operator and that man had assured me that it was fine to leave my bags. This second man then informed me that the first man had not understood me. He kept interrupitng me when I was speaking and was treating me like a small child. I left that hotel in tears and will never again stay there. Although two of the three men working there were very friendly this third man was extremely rude and condescending. I gave them a bottle of maple syrup as a small tip to which they did not say thank you or even acknowledge the gestrue. Given the number of hotelsin Amsterdam with similar access to transit and attractions I will never again stay at the Hoksbergen. I am sad to say that this man's attitude ruined the hotel for me. It had been acceptable. The breakfast was fair although not extravegant. The rooms were small although not overly clean. I advise travelers to find a different location.

<Content>Conveniently Located Hotel We stayed at the hotel for four nights this past July. We found the hotel to be of good value. The location is great. It is very convenient to almost all major tourist spots. The staff is extremely helpful and willing to find information for you if they do not know immediately.The bedroom and bathroom are both of ample size. This is a simple hotel with very few bells and whistles. A great place to come and put your head down at night (after you make the steep climb to your room). It is not the place for you if you are looking for luxury.

<Content>Great Centrally Located Hotel We stayed in the apartments that are around the corner from the actual hotel. Great breakfast/pastry shop across the canal, about 100 yards probably. Safe and clean area around the hotel. No more than a 20 minute walk to the tourist attractions in all directions. Also about a 20-25 minute walk to the train station and not hard to find. Would stay there again.

<Content>Extremely rude! I stayed in Hotel Hoksbergen with friends last September, despite having read bad reviews before I left UK, I went ahead and stayed there. Our stay was very basic and unclean, but bareable. The appartment was very small and dingy, the cups had dead flies in them and the kettle had tobacco in it when we arrived. The room wasn't cleaned once in our 5 day stay, but this was fine and we didn't mind that so much.I was desperate for somewhere to stay when booking another stay this September as we are on a strict budget. I rang again to enquire about accomodation availability and the receptionist answered the phone in Dutch. I then asked if they spoke english (I knew they would, but I just wanted to be polite), this was met with a short pause and then of course I speak english you idot, I felt that this was completely out of order and inexcusable. I had not made an effort to offend him in anyway, and the least he could have done was to show me the same courtesy back.I will never be staying at Hotel Hoksbergen again, and in fact I have been fortunate enough to book another apartment which is much cleaner, has had much better reviews, is more central and similarly priced.

<Content>Happy with the Hoksbergen Stayed for 5 nights in May 2007 and was very pleased with the accommodations. I knew the room and private bath would be small, and they were, but there was enough room for 2 girls and all their stuff. The twin beds were narrower than those in North America and even smaller than those in London, England - more like a north american cot but they were comfortable and the bedding was clean. The location was great, the staff were helpful, the water pressure and temperature was always good. Breakfast was fresh and tasty (help yourself to: bread, cereal, fruit, cheese, sliced meat, jam, orange juice, milk, water, coffee/tea)Frankly, I was expecting less for the price, so would highly recommend it for someone who is looking for a safe and convenient location (2 minute walk to Dam square and about a 10-15 minute walk to Central Station).

<Content>Great hotel!!! After searching for hotels in every single wesite, I decided to stay at Hoksbergen Hotel with my boyfriend based on the good reviews I saw on Trip Advisor. The hotel is realy great, our room wasn't very small, on the 2nd floor, with a good TV, big window and good bathroom. The shower was wonderful. The water was very hot and the pressure was great. The crew was very very very helpful, we asked for their help in many occasions and they always helped us. The breakfast was great, I'm from Brazil and here we don't have the habit of eating hot stuff. I should definetilly stay again in Hoksbergen Hotel!!!!!

<Content>Highly Reccomended We found Hotel Hoksbergen by searching TripAdvisor and were very pleased. The hotel was very cute and in the best location ever! There are plenty of nice shops and restaurants in the area. We had one of the best chocolate tortes that we have ever eaten just around the corner from the hotel. There is an Italian restaurant down the street (along the Single Canal) called Casa Di David that was wonderful. Also along the canal was Orange Bike Rentals. The owner was so nice. My husband and I wanted to rent bikes after he was already closed, and unfortunately were leaving for our flight in the morning before the bike shop would reopen. The owner allowed us to keep the bikes overnight and chain them in front of Hotel Hokesbergen, the front desk attendent kept the key. He allowed us to do this without keeping our ID for colladeral which is typical. The hotel was in such a beautiful area that one night we decided not to venture far and walked, ate dinner, sat in cafes, all within a few blocks of the hotel. The rooms are typical for Europe (small), but very clean. Should we return to Amsterdam, we will certainly stay in Hotel Hokesbergen.

<Content>Back for a second visit, memorable property! Hotel Hoksbergen has become a part of my yearly visit to Amsterdam. Last there in October 2005 this property is due a great review for making my second visit a memorable trip.Visiting from New York with two collegues all employed with British Airways we all booked separate rooms. The daily rate was reasonable and as usual the the accommodations were clean and comforatble. My room afforded a great view of the canal. A retreat from New York City life! All of my collegues were extremely pleased. We spent 4 nights (February 11th thry 15th) celebrating my birthday with activities in this beautiful city. The breakfasts were fresh  healthy with plentiful food and drink.The hotel is located within walking distance of many downtown attractions. The hotel is located in a 17th century canal house on the main canal. Staff is very helpful with travel tips and maps and is always ready to advise us on where to go  what to see. We have already agreed to return this October/November and will surely book this property again. We book directly from the hotel website. It is truly wonderful to have discovered this property!John PanellaBritish Airways Sales DepartmentNew York City

<Content>Really Enjoyed Our Stay My wife and I stayed in November during our Around the World Trip.The hotel is in a sensational position close to all the major places. The room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. The only MINOR downside was the stairs were steep and narrow. This meant two trips rather than one-a very minor discomfort. The staff were really helpful and all in all it is an excellent value for money Hotel.

<Content>A nice central hotel This is a well-kept, friendly hotel with a great location near the Singel canal. Our room was quite small but clean, although the bathroom was a little basic and cramped. The stairs are also very steep - but this is pretty standard in Amsterdam. Breakfast was good, reception was friendly, and they will let you leave your bags behind the desk. Go for a room with a view of the canal: it's about 10 Euros extra, but worth it.

<Content>For the money it was great I had hoped to stay at the Hotel Brouwer but it was full so I stayed at the Hotel Hoksbergen which I found on Tripadvisor.com The rooms are very small but are ensuite. The free breakfast is excellent as is the location. It is a small canal house right on the canal. Great restaurants close by and within easy walking distance of most tourist destinations. For the money it was great.

<Content>Would definitely recommend this one After reading the reviews we decided to stay at the Hoksbergen. The room was small but they warned us ahead. The staff were friendly and helpful, the breakfast was nice (good hot chocolate!) and the rooms were clean. We were on the top floor (5th) and there was no lift, which was good as we were overeating in Amsterdam. The site is perfect, very central on a beautiful canal and yet peaceful at night time. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Emily and Nicholas

<Content>Pretty good This was a pretty good find. I couldn't believe how close this was to the center of town (and everything else). The canal view is great. The breakfast was pretty good (ends at 10AM) and the service was friendly. They give you a key to the building so you can come and go whenever you please at any time of the day and night (this is important for me because I've stayed at places where there are curfews, and this is never enjoyable). The stairs were steep but not a problem for me. The rooms were small but not that small! (have any of the previous review writers been to Italy or Greece lately?) Anyway, this place is very clean and I'll definitely come back.

<Content>A charming, friendly and affordable hotel My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Hoksbergen for four days in late April, 2006, including the not-to-be-believed Queen's Day celebration, and we had a fine visit.The canal-side location was picturesque and a great base for seeing much of Amsterdam and the hosts (Bruno, especially) could not have been friendlier or more helpful.Yes, the rooms are tiny and yes, the stairs are steep, but that's all part of the charm of staying in a historic building. We had two twin beds pushed together and got a great night's sleep on them.Some others below have mentioned a problem with the smell of smoke, but we did not detect any odor, and my wife is very sensitive to smoke.The breakfast included excellent coffee, granola, cereal, bread for toast, and the standard European cheese, cold cuts and eggs. Just be forewarned: the stairs really are steep and narrow, so if you travel with several large bags it will be a challenge getting them to your room and finding a place for them once you get there. We had a good time at the hotel and would stay there again.,Dick and Diane BarnesLong Beach, California, USA

<Content>we love this place We have stayed here numerous times and have always been very pleased. Yes, it's small and there are a lot of steps but it's clean, the new breakfast buffet is great and the staff have always been so kind, helpful and very accommodating to their guests. The location is great and it's close to one of our favorite vegetarian restaurants on Spuistraat, Green Planet.

<Content>Great rates, location, clean, quiet...what more do you need? I just got back from a week in Amsterdam with a girl friend for my 30th birthday. We chose the Hoksbergen based on location, price and the fact that breakfast was included. We were not disappointed. It is located a brief walk from almost everything, and it was safe, quaint, and practically silent on the streets at night for a good sleep. No young, rowdy people were staying while we were there - a lot of couples, young quiet 20-30 somethings and lone travellers. Our room was #1, the first after one flight of stairs off the hotel lobby and entry. We had no great view (only of a side street), and the room was REALLY small, but they warned us in advance since we got the last room in the place, so we were forewarned and fine with it. We had our own bathroom in our room with a shower, sink and toilet, but it was comedic how small it was!! The breakfast was nice and included toast, eggs, cereal, tea, coffee, juice, etc. More than enough to start the day. Everyone was nice and helpful. We were going to spend the other half of the week at another place, just to mix it up a bit, but after checking around at other places, nobody could beat the price and value of our room. Would definitely recommend trying for a canal view room since it will only be icing on the cake. I would stay here again, no problem! Great value if you are looking for a good deal and a nice stay. Not for the picky and high maintenance. Oh! Our room really smelled like smoke, which sucked for us since we are non-smokers, but we were also right above the office and the front desk person was a smoker, so the office smoke definitely drifted up to us. We would open the windows to clear it when we got home, but it always had a faint old smoke smell, much like a lot of Amsterdam!

<Content>great on a budget Stayed at the hotel mid November 2005. The location was fantastic. I would recommend a room with a canal view. Rooms were a little tight, but very clean. Staff was extremely helpful! The Dutch style breakfast was a plus. Fresh foods (fruit, sliced meats and cheeses, cereals, and juice/coffee). Had a small problem with a leak in my room, but the problem was corrected in a timely manner. In true Amsterdam style, steep narrow stairways connected each floor. Short walk to Dam Square, RLD, shopping. Spuistraat runs behind the hotel, and there are some really good restaurants within walking distance. Also a short walk into trendy Grachtengordel West/Jordaan district. 15 minute walk to Central Station, but trams run near hotel (3 minute walk) that can get you pretty much anywhere in the city. Had no problems with safety.

<Content>perfect place in Amsterdam Thanks Xia / Bruno / Bert for making our first visit to Amsterdam a memorable one. Me, my wife and our 11 year old son had a wonderful stay here with a fab view of the canal. Most tourist attractions were nearby and Xia / Bruno / Bert were most helpful with their suggestions. The breakfast was a delightful spread. Bruno, thanks for loaning the umbrella!Hope to visit Amsterdam (or rather Hoksbergen)soon.

<Content>My Love Affair with the Hoksbergen... Hotel Hoksbergen is the most charming and sweetest spot along the singel canal. This pleasant peaceful place is perfect for travelers on a small budget who dont want to sacrafice cleanliness and comfort for cheap rates. My stay at the hoksbergen was magical, the free dutch continental breakfast was so tantilizing- fresh squeezed oj, ice cold water, thick fresh dutch milk, variety of cereal (the best granola i have ever had!), yummy cold cuts ham, salami, cheese, soft boiled eggs, and the most wonderful jams and a delightful selection of toasts, what more could you ask for?The double room my friend and i stayed in was completlly quaint and immaculate. Fresh towels, clean sheets, extra pillows, everything was on point. The staff were so awesome, spoke excellent english and provided us with lots of valueable tips and advise for enjoying the wonders of the lovliest city in Europe. I can not count the numerous times my friend and I discussed how much we loved the hoksbergen. The location was perfect, close to every tourist sight, yet maintains the perfect distance from the hustle bustle, and noise of city, and is very safe.My friend and I, (two nineteen year old girls), felt completly secure during our stay One of the best and oldest bars in town Gollem, is right around the corner. Great Greek food is five steps down the street, and if the continental breakfast did not fill you up, there is an excellent bakery wich serves the freshest best smelling and tasting crossaints in all of the city. Oh and for all of you spliff smokin souls, numeous, numerous coffeeshops are just a hop, skip, and jump away! Plus the staff did not seem to mind the sweetsmelling sent of sensi, whcih escaped from our room (:well once again, frommers and I both highly reccomend this hotel!My trip to the DAM would not have been so incredible if the homey hotel Hoksbergen were not in the picture. go ahead and start your own love affair...
