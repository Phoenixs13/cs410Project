<Content>Warning: hotel website is decietful!!! The hotels website does not reflect the real condition of this rundown facility whatsoever. They claimed to have great Romantic Packages which was far from the truth. When we arrived, they did not have the ocean view room we requested and we were put in a temporary room in the meantime which was a rundown room with a broken shower head and no hot water. We then woke up to the sounds of jackhammers blasting away at 6:30 in the morning - apparently they were in the process of renovating the swimming pool which were not made aware of, so in essence, the pool was out of service. The restaurant which was part of the package was only open in the afternoon and early evening, which meant the free breakfast they said was part of the package was non existant. On the third day we finally moved into our correct room and by the end of the day the A/C went out! We then had to move to ANOTHER room which was maginally OK except no ocean view again. The staff made my stay equally as uncomfortable showing nothing but rudeness and indifference concerning our situation. We finally had enough and moved to another hotel down the road called EL Pedregalwhich was much nicer and has Jacuzzi tubs included! We wasted 3 days of our honeyroom being needlessly aggravated by the Cielo Mar hotel and its staff. This place should definitely be put out of its misery. I highly suggest you avoid this hotel like the PLAGUE!!!

<Content>Horrible The view is without a doubt breathtaking. And that's also without a doubt the only good thing about this place. From the disappointing and unwelcoming staff, the lack of maintenance, smelly rooms (and not good flowery smell), torn fridge in the room to the vase of old dirty water and dead flowers at the Front Desk this whole experience was simply HORRIBLE.  The tongue of the whale at the pool is literally black, the stairs leading to the pool are covered with a green moss like crap (slippery) and the pool itself is dirty and full of leaves. The lobby area is very dirty, the floors very dusty. No elevators, and the stairs handrails very rusty and sticky. None of the staff has a uniform, their wear anything they want, any color, any style, and the housekeepers are wearing nurse uniforms. Very unprofessional.And in fact the musty stench in the rooms was so horrible that we could not stay at all. We ended up having to move to another hotel. So please do not waste your time and money. Do not even consider this place. It looks NOTHING like the internet page!!!

<Content>Don't Waste your Time/Money We just came back from our honeymoon. The problems started the moment we arrived (it was also a problem to find the place)..The hotel manager was very unfriendly. The room was unpleasant for honeymooners. They told us we had an ocean view, which was the view of a non romantic commercial pier that could be seen from our tiny balcony.In general, bad service, bad experience..We were supposed to stay there for four days, however the day after we checked out, and found a better place nearby called El Pedregal.

<Content>the best on the west coast for the price. As a frequent business trips to the west area of PR I use this hotel. Staff is always friendly and as helpfull as their limitatios can give. The restaurant is not luxury but very good local food, price and staff. Rooms are good but very poor ilumination, no radio and no good tv signal. Besides for the price is a great deal specially if you get that grrrrrreeeaaattttt sunset view!!!!!!Belive me, I go to Aguadilla every two month for the last seven years and this is by far the best option.

<Content>As my fellow traveler said, 'Craptastic!' I rarely write one-star reviews. As a younger traveler, my standards are not as refined, I suppose. Given that, I would never stay at Cielo Mar again. Granted, this was a last minute business trip to Aguadilla, and there are no 'American' hotels in the area. That said, this one is miserable. First off, you plug in its address to any GPS device, and it directs you to the middle of a residential area not near the hotel. After searching 30 minutes for the hotel, my fellow traveler and I check in to find that they give you the TV remote when you check in. Never a good sign. You enter the room, and my first thought was 1950s New Jersey Shore with no updates or cleaning since that time. Thankfully, no critters, but rust everywhere. Never seen more of it in my life. The Internet was not working (not a huge surprise I suppose), and I really did not want to get into the bed without a full body covering. The air conditioning only semi-worked. Breakfast on our second morning started 30 minutes later, so we could not get any before leaving for our business meeting. All in all, a bad hotel that I would never return to. Try Villa Montana instead - equally as difficult to find, but the restaurant was fabulous and the ocean view amazing.

<Content>Stay Somewhere Else First of all, I did not choose this hotel. I had no option, as I was attending a marriage seminar and the hotel was chosen by the organizers. We stayed for a weekend, and I was ready to get divorced if I had to stay a day longer (which kind of beats the purpose of the weekend).The rooms were quite comfortable, and that is the only good thing about them. There was very poor lighting, and the bathroom was a nightmare. The bathtub was stained and rusty, really disgusting. The air conditioner is turned off when the rooms are not in use, and there is a lot of humidity, so you can imagine the smell when we walked into the room. My husband had to take down a screen to be able to open a window to let the room air out (no balcony in our room). The pillows were really thin, and when we asked for extra pillows, there were none (they had already been distributed to other complaining guests). A couple that was attending the seminar had to go out and buy their own pillows. The staff was friendly, but couldn't really provide much service.On the positive side, the view is great and if you have kids, the pool is designed for their entertainment, with slides and waterfalls. But I have no plans on ever staying there again. If I need another weekend escape, I'll stay somewhere else in Puerto Rico. We have much better hotels, where the rates are reasonable.

<Content>Terrible Rooms And Service!!!!! Would Not Recommend This At All... This place looks beautiful on the website but it's the opposite. The rooms have old chipped furniture. There's no water pressure at all in the bathroom shower and sink. Room service never changed the sheets of the beds. Room service never came by to clean up the room or make the bed. I and relatives stayed there for 4 days and were disgusted/disatified with the rooms and service. I would not recommend this.The only thing this place has going for it is the bar with the ocean scene. But bar closes around 1030 or so, not good.

<Content>Hated the Cielo Mar My husband  I stayed at this establishment and would not recommend it . The halls were dirty, the music from the weekend parties were blasting and we could not sleep. The resturant was closed on Saturday even though we had the package deal. The staff made no effort to accomdate our needs. This place needs a great over haul.MillieFlorida

<Content>Beautiful view My husband and I and our 2 kids stayed at Cielo Mar from August 15 - 20th. The hotel was clean and we stayed at the new building. We were told we could get the ocean view room but the day we arrived they were working on installin new A/C's, so they put us in the new building instead. The room was big and clean. Very large bathroom. We were really only in the room at night to sleep and take showers. They had a nice video game room, which the kids utilized. They had a nice pool, but we were never around in the day time to use it. Overall the hotel was nice and we would definitely stay there again because the price was right (approx $83 per night).

<Content>We loved it!!! My husband and I stood here for 4 days and it was beautiful. Im a clean freak and the room was perfect, we had been previously staying at El Guajataca was a disaster the place was terrible. The staff was so nice they had learned about our terrible experience at the other place that they let us check in to our room about 3 hours pior to check in. The staff all speak english which worked out great for us and the restuarant had great food. They have a nice pool and also have wireless internet service and the even have a computer room for the guests to use. I definetly recommend this place to anyone and I would stay here again. What is also great is that the airport in Aguadilla is literally five minutes away, alot of people dont know that this airport has major Airline companies flying in there like Jet Blue. Also you have Ramey base within minutes from here. It's very easy to get to from the major highway #2. And parking is free, not like some other places who charge an additional fee for parking. You have Crash boat beach within minutes. Overall this place is great!!!!

<Content>3RD world accommodations The rooms are very small and services are practically non-existant. After 2 days they finally fixed the beds...The dining facility was only operating on weekends, if there were enough guests in the hotel. Currently there is construction going on in the pool area. Unfortunately the noise starts at 7 am, someone forgot to tell management that guests sleep past early morning. You definately need a car because there's nothing within walking distance. There are better hotels in Aguadilla but they lack the ocean view. However, the view isn't worth the construction noise and poor services.

<Content>Ask to see the room first... We arrived at Cielo Mar on Jan 27 and check-in went smoothly. Bilingual staff was friendly  helpful. We were given a huge, beautiful modern room with big bathroom and brand new mini-fridge. The only disappointment was that my husband wanted an area for studying, and there was not much lighting in the room, no desk  no balcony. So I requested a room with a balcony, and got a room that was like stepping back in time 20 years. Tiny room, tiny bathroom with no counter space  rusted out fridge. But it did have a tiny balcony  a view, so we kept it. Bring your own hair dryer. Hotel also has a game room with pool table  vending machines. There is an ice machine that requires 25-cents for ice. We were generally given one bath towel, and always had to ask for more. Eventually I raided the towel closet on my own. Even had to ask housekeeping for plastic cups. Although it's on the ocean, there is no beach access at the hotel. Crash Boat beach is a 5-minute drive down the road. The hotel's outdoor restaurant has a beautiful view. We ate there one night...hubby had mahi-mahi which was salty  fishy tasting, I had stuffed chicken (which clearly was Sam's Club chicken cordon bleu, but tasted good). Beans  rice were good. We both had a side of mixed vegetables which were ice cold. Asked to have them replaced  got them luke warm the second time. The restaurant was virtually dead every night during our 4-night stay--not surprised. Watch the sunset there, and then drive to Rincon to the Lazy Parrot for a much better meal. We didn't use the pool, but it looked good. There is also a kid's pool. No jacuzzi. The Cielo Mar is like a palace compared to the rest of Aguadilla, but still not to the standard I was expecting.

<Content>Worth the Money and A Great View We had a third story room that cost us $70. The hotel is located just above the coastline. Our room (as do most of their rooms) had a small balcony with two chairs and a small table that overlooked the ocean. It was an outstanding view, especially at sunset. The room was very clean and of an adequate size for my wife and me. It had a TV and air conditioning. There was also a nice looking on-site restaurant (although we didn't eat there) and a very nice swimming pool. I highly recommend it. You can't beat the value. The view alone was worth the money.
