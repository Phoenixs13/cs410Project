<Content>Fantastic Hotel in great location I have just returned from a fantastic three day stay in this hotel with two friends of mine. The hotel staff were very friendly and and incredibly helpful. The hotel is in a great location. We walked to everything we wanted to see. It's about 30 mins on the tram from the airport which cost us 2.10 euros. The breakfast every morning was lovely. I would definitely stay in this hotel again!

<Content>Fantastic My husband and I we鈥檝e stayed at hackescher hotel for 3 nights 鈥?New Year鈥檚 Eve 2007/8. This hotel is simply fantastic. The staff is friendly, very professional, ample room and very very good breakfast! The location is great. Restaurants and bars in walking distance, a lot of shops, really it couldn鈥檛 be better. Berlin is an amazing city and it was a very good way to begin 2008. So if you visit Berlin (you should!) don鈥檛 hesitate and stay at this hotel.

<Content>Unexpected lovely staying in Berlin I 've read a lot of hotel reviews before I chose this one to stay during our 5 days in Berlin (I went there with my parents).This hotel is simply GREAT. The very young staff is too friendly, runs the day by day of the hotel very professionaly. Ample room and very very good breakfast - I've never found such a breakfast in a hotel 3 stars before. The location is superbe, 10 min to Berliner Dom, Bebelptaz, Alexander Platz and Museums island. You may find not so attractive the small street it is located - there is a train stop just in front of it - but, really ? forget it. You will be so well treated, touristic sights will be so near you that it will mean nothing after your so splendid staying in Berlin. The hotel is also quite closer to a metro station so you could come to West side in less than 10 min! Perfect. Berlin was a great and unforgetable surprise and this hotel contributed to it. And more, the hotel is very close to Nikolaiviertel (10 min walking) - a lovely spot where there are a lot of restaurants. An amazing walking.

<Content>Great location in Mitte The smallest rooms are really small. Take a step up and it's worth the extra price, especially if you snag a room that faces the quiet and lovely courtyard, way more peaceful than the street-side entrance, which faces a tram stop. All in all, I liked the hotel, though it lacks personality. The location in Mitte can't be beat - very central, yet also tucked away on a side street, so you are away from the bustle when you leave each morning and return each night. I eventually switched hotels and stayed in Prenzlauer Berg, which seemed more vital and less commercial than what Mitte has become over the past few years, but this being Berlin, I fear P'berg is just a year or two behind....

<Content>Great hotel, great location We stayed here for 3 nights, June 15th - 17th. Hackescher Markt Hotel is ideally located. It's within walking distances of many attractions or you can walk about 1/2 block to the train station. Many restaurants, even Starbucks, are located within a block or so. As is the case with many hotels in Europe, rooms are not air conditioned, but stay here in Winter, Fall, early Summer, or spring. We enjoyed out room on the top floor (there is an elevator) with lovely dormer windows that swing open giving a great breeze. It was hot here during the day but wonderfully cool breeze in the evening and all night. Service was excellent, staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was wonderful and included in the room rate. There is secure underground parking provided for a fee, located about 1 1/2 blocks away.I'll definitely stay here again when we return to Berlin!

<Content>NEVER stay here in the summer I stayed (or tried to stay) at the hotel during the world cup. Aside from gouging us (charged us a crazy rate) the hotel had no air conditioning, no service, and no help.The rooms were like ovens. Even though I couldn't get my money back, I walked out of the hotel and got a room at another hotel because I couldn't sit in the room for 10 minutes without breaking a sweat.If you want to speak to someone, you had better show up during the 2 hours the manager is there because nobody else can answer a question or is empowered to do anything.Another guest was so tired of sweating every night the bought a portable air conditioner to use during their stay.Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel.

<Content>Don't stay here The reception by staff was poor in a tiny reception area. We got no help with our bags. The rooms are dull and I don't understand why the hotel raves about its English draperies. The window openings were small and the heat unbearable. There is no airconditioning. We stayed one hour of our four night booking. In a great location, but stay somewhere else. Berlin just doesn't get the small luxury hotel market.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Location What a neighbourhood! Hackeescher Markt Hotel is in a fabulous and trendy part of Berlin. I booked our reservation by phone. The location is great for sight seeing and shopping. Our room was quiet, bright and clean. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. There is a cozy bar just beside the lobby with big windows. The staff was helpful and friendly. We joined a New Berlin walking tour at the New Synagogue- just down the street. Our English-speaking tour guide (Kristian) was originally from Toronto. He took us through the old Jewish Neighbourhood and other parts of Mitte. He was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and entertaining. His knowledge of Berlin and European History was impressive. After our four hour tour, he dropped us off at the hotel.

<Content>This is The place! TMy wife and I recently (May, 2006) spent eight days in Berlin where we stayed at this gem of a small botique hotel. If you are looking to spend in the $ 175.00-$ 200.00 per night range, you can not beat this place.The staff of Michael, Thorsten, Sabrina and their associates could not do enough for us. They suggested great restaurants and interesting places to see as well as provided us with easy directions. I would recommend getting a room facing the interior garden. It is quieter and nicer than the alternatives.While I am sure one can get less expensive rooms in Berlin, Hackeshcer Markt is well worth every Euro! The location is fantastic--a short walk to all the museums on Museum Isle, 20 minutes or so from the Brandenburg gate and Eastern boundary of the Tiergarten, directly near (2 minutes away) from a major S-bahn stop, five minutes away from where the boats leave for rides on the River Spree , just off a very happenin' square, and ten minutes from the Neue SynagogueThe breakfast alone is worth about $ 25.00 per person and can last (if you want) until dinner.I have rarely been treated better at any place I have stayed in the over 40 years I have travelled in Europe.Arnold MillerPittsburgh,Pa.

<Content>Great Hotel Just back from 4 nights in Berlin, staying at the Hackescher. Location great - direct S-bahn from Schonefeld Airport to Hackescher station. Two minute walk from there. Lovely little market between station and hotel and plenty of restaurants in the area. Hotel itself clean, comfortable and friendly. Good buffet breakfast. Booked a room at the back for the sake of peace and quiet but the street did not seem overly noisy anyway. Took 3 requests and 24 hours to get an extra pillow (!) but other than that would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel in Great Location The hotel is located by a train station and a great square with restaurants and outdoor cafe's. We upgraded to a suite and really enjoyed ourselves. Breakfast was wonderful and was included. Our travel company has used this hotel with good success before and we are happy they booked us there.

<Content>Disappointing The hotel is in a fantastic location but the rooms are very small - ask for a room overlooking the courtyard. Staff were okay but a few things really annoyed us - asked for some extra towels which didn't come until the next day, front door was locked and had to wait 15 minutes to be let in (not good when you need to catch a flight), NO 24 HOUR BAR AS ADVERTISED. Breakfast was also not included.

<Content>Friends in the heart of the storm My travels lead me to Berlin on a monthly basis, I just found this Island of peace and friendship amidst one of the new vibrating touristy hotspots. A small house (30something rooms) in a classicistic building, smashingly renovated (I know the area from ten years ago!) very personal, individual rooms (try the attic!), cosy and funny backyard 鈥済arden鈥?tables for breakfast (in summer). Not 鈥渢he luxury place鈥?but upper middle class at an extremely cool value for money ratio. Hotel has all you need, perfectly clean, tasteful interior and most important: fresh, friendly and cheerful staff 鈥?I travel a lot around the globe and haven鈥檛 enjoyed something that much for a while. So if you don鈥檛 need a big Spa, Fitness, Wellness, Boutique, chichi, etc. GO there and feel at home. And the best is: 3 S-Bahn (tram) stations away from Ostbahnhof (main station east) and about 2 min. walk from the S-Bahn station 鈥?right at the Hackescher Markt a pulsating area of history and shopping and night-out opportunities (was THE hot spot about 6 years ago and is a bit more settled now but still very enjoyable). Close to the Museum Island, Alexanderplatz and not far from the hotspot area 鈥淧renzlauer Berg鈥? Have fun.

<Content>A great little find in Mitte Just returned from a wonderful 3 night stay at the Hachescher Markt hotel. Hotel in a fantastic location - within walking distance of Hachescher Hof courtyards, cafes, bars, restaurants, river. Brandenburg Gate about a 30 minute stroll away down Unter der Linden. We didn't need to use public transport once apart from taxis to and from the airport. Rooms are very clean and a good size. Bathrooms are modern. Remember to ask for a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the courtyard rather than the front. Don't let the trams parked outside the front of the hotel put you off. Bar wasn't open when we stayed but this doesn't matter as there is such a choice on your doorstep. Breakfasts are fab - a great selection and fresh food. Staff are very friendly and speak good English. Had a wonderful meal at the Noodle Bar overlooking the river and the very impressive Berliner Dom - about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We didn't realise it was part of the Radisson chain but the interior was very modern, staff extremely friendly and they had a wonderful cigar lounge at the back of the bar. Would definitely go back to this hotel - location, location, location as well as friendly service!
