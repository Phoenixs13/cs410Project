<Content>Loving Kebun Indah On the scale of 1 (Very Bad) to 10 (Very Good), we would rate for...Security: 10 (A security guard will be there throughout the long night to ensure your safety)Cleanliness: 10 (No unusual odor 'found' in bed/rest room)Friendliness of Staff: 10 (Very helpful and cheerful)Breakfast: 10 (Thumbs up for their great making of yummy breakfast and the door-to-door service provided)The guesthouse-style-hotel is surrounded by great green nature. Quiet and peaceful. A FREE transport service from the hotel to Ubud town can be arranged by the staff overthere. - A great Italian Restaurant named Pizza Bagus is just situated opposite to the main entrance of the hotel. - The Famous Zen Bali Spa and Dirty Duck Restaurant (a.k.a Bebek Bengil) are about 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel.Hope this helps :)Cheers,Couple from Kuala Lumpur
