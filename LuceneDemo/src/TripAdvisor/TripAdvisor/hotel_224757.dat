<Content>Pleasant, cooperative staff; enjoyable stay A four-story building (ground floor with three floors above) parallel to and facing Interstate 10. The building has internal corridors and parking on all sides.After leaving Exit 139, from 51st Avenue going north take the first left-turn lane to enter W. Willetta St. (a Holiday Inn sits on the corner). From W. McDowell Road turn into N. 52nd Drive (you will see a Motel 6) which curves and becomes W. Willetta St.During our week-long stay we found all the desk staff pleasant, cooperative and helpful 鈥?especially (Kim who checked us in) and David. We would return to the motel.If you prefer a quieter room, request one on the top (4th) floor towards either end of the corridor (for instance, end rooms 401 or 435 which look out from the ends of the building) and away from the elevator, vending-ice machines and housekeepers鈥?storage area. Prefer rooms which face the vacant lot (at the time of writing) across W. Willetta St. at the front of the building rather than rooms which face the Interstate (which has the constant drone of passing traffic). Avoid connecting doors between rooms 鈥?unless you need them.We had an end room on the third floor and found the soundproofing between the floors adequate (you could just hear water flow in the room above). A gap between the bottom of the room door and the carpeting (inevitably) admitted noise from the corridor. Except for the brief whine of a housekeeper鈥檚 vacuum cleaner in the morning (after 9 a.m. on) and the occasional door left to slam closed by another guest, we did not find this a problem during our stay.Note that housekeeping will leave only one sachet of shampoo in each room; hence, you will have to ask for extra from housekeeping in the morning or from the reception desk when housekeeping has finished servicing all the rooms.Guests would find it beneficial if the Accor chain could manage to provide: two sachets of shampoo in each room as part of standard provisions instead of one, Do Not Disturb signs to hang outside the room door, channels TCM and AMC in addition to the (limited) selection offered, and a free Internet terminal in the lobby for those people who do not travel encumbered with a laptop computer.On the positive side, this particular motel did have good staff overall, a 24-hour automatic coffee machine which also dispensed hot chocolate and hot water for tea, and a morning newspaper left outside the door. We found useful the McDonald鈥檚 a 1-2 minute walk across the road. You can also find a Mexican restaurant and a supermarket in a shopping plaza you can walk to conveniently at the NW corner of 51st Avenue and W. McDowell Road.

<Content>Okay Despite the clean rooms and friendly staff, I wouldn't recommend anybody to stay here. I have no complaints of the hotel itself. It's a no frills hotel that suits its purpose. There were four guys in our party staying in 2 rooms for one night as part of a golf trip. Many reviews said people felt unsafe staying here. While we didn't feel unsafe, this definitely is not the nicest part of town. Here's what we saw just to give you an idea. Many of the houses in the surrounding neighborhoods have all of the windows and doors barred. The grocery store across the street had all of their hard alcohol locked up in a cage and we had to have a clerk get it for us. There were quite a few sketchy looking citizens walking around after dark. On the morning we left, there was a cop driving around the parking lot dressed in a bullet proof vest. We watched him stop a kid who appeared to be breaking into a truck in the parking lot. During the night, there is a security guard on site who ventures around the hotel so we did feel okay about leaving our vehicle and golf clubs in the parking lot. If you need to visit this area for any reason, I would recommend staying either closer to the airport, further west of Phoenix, or further north of this area. The extra 15 minutes of drive time is well worth it.

<Content>Nice staff, clean and quiet stay Pretty much just a clean quiet place to stay. No coffee maker, iron, or anything extra in the rooms. Had to ask for extra blanket and iron and ironing board. Paid more than it's worth due to Nascar race weekend. Nice stay. Would recommend if just need a place to sleep that is clean and quiet.
