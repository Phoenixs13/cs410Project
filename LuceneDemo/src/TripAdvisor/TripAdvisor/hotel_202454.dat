<Content>Fantastic value for money When you pay so little (Euro 64 for a double room including breakfast), you set your expectations accordingly....but wow, were we impressed!The hotel is situated in the Tegel area, next to a shopping centre and cinema complex. In this complex is a fitness centre, which hotel guests can use free of charge. It is a modern building in what used to be the Borsig factory complex. Many of the old factory buildings have been converted to offices etc. A nice area.But to the important stuff: rooms average size, neutral decor, two twin beds (no doubles), enough wardrobe space for a long weekend, nicely laid out, limited choice minibar but with fair prices, bathroom with good size shower cubicle, but no bath. Proper hairdryer - not one of those where you have to hold the button down all the time. Even with a cool shot to set your style! One minor complaint - the safe in the wardrobe is on the top shelf. To see inside it you have to be 2m tall. Or stand on a chair.The breakfast buffet was excellent, with lots of types of meats and cheeses. Best of all, you could order FRESHLY MADE eggs and bacon, pancakes, milkshakes, and there was a machine with FREE coffee (latte, espresso) available 24 HOURS.Internet acccess is also FREE, although there are only 2 computers and one was broken when we were there. Not a big deal.Parking is a bit of a hassle, as the hotel only has 15 spaces in the driveway. But the shopping centre car park is a short walk away and is manned 24 hours a day. Parking is Euro 5.50 per exit, so if you stay 3 days and never move your car, it costs Euro 5.50....The U6 underground station was nearby. The hotel rents out bikes, which several people were using whilst we were there.There is a nice Italian (Montichiello) oposite the Borsig gate and a fabulous and cheap (for German standards) Thai restaurant in a side street off the Berliner Strasse (Brunowstr. 8). It's called Ruan-Thai. Go there.As of now, this is our number one hotel in Berlin.

Restaurant was not the cosiest of environments BUT the food was excellent, the beer good and very reasonably priced.Top Tip, try the Alt Fritz down the road... 15 mins (ask Reception) it's a great bar where the locals go!

<Content>Great Rooms and Friendly Staff I was impressed with the quality of this property. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff was very attentive and went above and beyond the call of duty. I gave an average rating as my room did not have a bath tub which as spacious as the bathroom was there was PLENTY of room for one. Also, the location is outside where most tourists would want to stay, however, Borsigwerke U-Bahn stop is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel. I would definately stay here again if I had a flight departing out of Berlin Tegal.

<Content>Wonderful weekend Had a wonderful weekend. It was great value for money. This is a clean modern hotel with very comfortable rooms. The service is pleasant and efficient. Although it is outside Berlin it is right by the underground which takes you straight through to the centre and is within walking distance of a beautiful lake. It is also beside a huge new shopping centre in a nice area and is peaceful at night . There is a free hot drinks machine and internet in the foyer and breakfast , apart from an excellent buffet, has also waitress service with freshly cooked eggs or pancakes. The hotel restaurant serves a large variety of good food at reasonable prices.
