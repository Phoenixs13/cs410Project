<Content>disgrace We reserved four months in advance and the hotel still managed to double book us. They refused to find us a replacement hotel in the neighbourhood; the replacement hotel they found us was on the outskirts of town. They did not make any real effort either to try and resolve the situation and found the situation quite amusing and worthy of laughter. They also lied about the availability in our hotels claiming there was no free rooms anywhere in the whole of Berlin because of a trade fair, clearly this is nonsense. They manager was also threatening and curt and lied that they tried to contact us prior to our arrivalWe do not recommend staying here and suffering the same ordeal as we did. Totally unprofessional and untrustworthy.

<Content>A good stay This was a small clean hotel with helpful friendly staff. The rooms were not huge or glamorous but had all that you would expect from a three star hotel. Everything was clean. The breakfasts had a good choice of foods. The location was in a quiet area but near enough to everything. I would stay here again.

<Content>Ok hotel Very nicely located. Nothing really special about this hotel. I arrived about 1 hour early than check in time. waited in lobby for my room. Wanted to use my laptop found without US power adaptor, Front desk lady first says no more adaptor. Asked repeatedly and played miserable, she came up with one (sigh!). And maybe, just maybe it's coincident, right after I tip her, she told me that my room is ready (hmmmmm)Hotel doesn' allow un-registered guest coming at late night, even with your company. I have no proble with that rule and actually apprecite it's effort for security. But wish they publish their policy somewhere for traveler. Decided to check out earlier. was acommodated without panelty. Thanks. Special thanks to Victor, the blond 20s front desk person tried to help me find point of interest .Very nice Breakfast.Will consider stay again only if hotel allow bring guest in. (for security, hotel can have that person's ID documented, you can't just flatly say no without warning)

<Content>small and friendly Visited Berlin with husband and friends having been offered a great deal with air.miles. The Hotel was in a central location close to the underground system. Breakfast was adequate and enough to keep you going during the day. Our room had previously been a smoking room + required us to open windows to clear the air, however from Jan 08 the hotel is totally non-smoking. We brought tickets for U-bahn, S-bahn, trams + buses daily at a cost of 15 euro's (for all four of us) from the hotel. This was excellent as the underground system is brilliant and we were able to travel around the whole of Berlin quickly. The Markets at this time of year are essential to visit with wonderful atmosphere, good street food and gluwein (hot toddy). Visit the T.V Tower for good views across both east + west Berlin. (suggest get there early). Do not miss the 'memorial to the murdered Jews' a very moving honest report of the holocaust. Lots of history to read and view, overall a fascinating city that i would love to visit again.

<Content>Fantastic stay We booked the Scandotel Castor for a weekend away to see the xmas markets in Berlin, and the trip turned out to be one of the best weekends way we've ever had. In particular, the hotel was extremely good value for money, clean, well furnished, excellent (english speaking) ever helpful staff, good food and located 5 minutes from the main shopping area and city parks and only 10 minutes by taxi from the Brandenburg gate and other historical attractions. I thoroughly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Warm and quiet Completely agree with most of the other reviews. Room wasn`t huge but perfectly adequate and very quiet. Charming staff on reception and in the dining room for breakfast which had a good selection of cold meats and cheese and a small selection of hot food. Strangely only coffee was offered, you had to ask for tea but it wasn`t a problem. Rather than take a more expensive bus tour we used the 100 and 200 public buses which visit most of the tourist attractions. The hotel sells a small leaflet which gives details. There are several reasonably priced restaurants nearby of different ethnic origins. Altogether a really good place to stay and not too costly.

<Content>Great Hotel  We booked our 3 night stay with direct line city breaks on line. The Airline was Easyjet. The Hotel doesn't look much from outside but what a gem! rooms were clean and comfortable all recently refurbished. Breakfast was good as well alot of choice and you can eat as much as you can, sets you up for the day! The only thing the rooms could do with is tea and coffee facilities, but it has a mini bar to put your own drinks in. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom which is really good so don't take your own like i did. We got the train from Shonefield airport which took an Hour i think it was the S9 train cost 5 euros for 2. Also you can buy a 3 day travel card for 20 euros (2 people) that covers the underground (U-Bahn) and the overland trains the S-Bahn so a real bargin. They fine you 40 euros if you get caught with no ticket so worth gertting one. We had over meals at a place called the 60's diner near the Nollendorf U station and very cheap at 8 euros for a good dinner. We did most of the sites but be ready to que for about an hour for the The Reichstag and the TV Tower, we went to the tower on the monday morning so it was less busy and went straight in at 10am and what a view over the city, be prepared to pay 8 euro's for 2 coffee's in the cafe at the top!! Very expensive but enjoyable as it turns twice an hour and you get a great view of the city. The main shops are closed on sundays so don't' plan to go shopping on that day like we did!! I would suggest to buy a good guide book as this helped us to lcoate what we wanted to visit and see. Have a great time.

<Content>great location, a fine hotel central location at a reasonable price was what we wanted and that's exactly what we got, a very good hotel in an excellent spot. Fuggerstrasse itself is a quiet residential street (apart from a small number of bars  restaurants, most sporting rainbow flags) in two halves, off on a diagonal, we found the hotel easier to get back to by walking along Ku'damm  Tauentzienstrasse past Wittenbergplatz into Kleiststrasse - so all one continuous street, you'll never need to remember the names! - then turning right into Eisenacherstrasse, just past the easy-to-spot Conrad Electronics building. the handful of bars  clubs along Fuggerstrasse are far away enough from the hotel you'd really not know they were there, there's no overspill of people and absolutely no noise, but if they are your thing you're in an excellent place to enjoy.Wittenbergplatz is the nearest subway, less than 5 minutes walk away, and the 7 day market there is opposite the very swish KaDeWe department store - this felt like the start of Ku'Damm, it's shops all the way as far as they eye can see and the legs can walk.hotel was small but perfectly formed, rooms compact but very clean  functional, the breakfast buffet was excellent and the bar cosy. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place, or to return, the staff are as friendly  helpful as the area is a joy to walk around.

<Content>Good value and location It's centrally located and within a couple blocks of the U-Bahn, but in a quiet residential area. My room was of a good size for a reasonably priced European hotel. The bed was comfortable, there was a good closet, and the European-style gooseneck shower (no tub) worked fine. Located in the heart of Berlin's gay community, and tolerant, as its Swedish-Nordic focus implies, my sense was that nonetheless most of the guests were Swedish straight couples of a certain age. The staff were very friendly and helpful -- about bike rentals, maps, and a few minutes late checkout.

<Content>An Excellent Hotel I can't add much more to the previous reviews. Being an avid TripAdvisor reader, I check all the relevant reviews in hotels I'm intending to visit. The Scandotel really is a gem. We stayed for 3 nights 1/3-4/3. It's 5 minutes from KaDeWe store, which is a joyous shopping experience. Go to the 6th floor have a glass of bubbly and people watch for a while.The hotel is in the gay sector and there are lot's of gay bars and shops. We are 3 (straight) ladies and felt completely safe and happy to explore the streets at night.As for the hotel itself, it's very clean and comfortable. Non-smoking rooms are available on 3 floors and yes, the breakfasts are good. Every staff member was extremely helpful, we made good use of them asking for dinner reservations and recommendations. There's a very good trad German restaurant about 10 mins walk away by the name of 1885. The food was excellent and very reasonably priced.I would absolutely recommend the hotel as centrally located, clean and well run. I booked through the hotel website and got 2 doubles plus breakfast for 60 Euros per night.Enjoy your trip to Berlin!

<Content>Just the job! Stayed in this hotel for 6 nights. Found it to be ideal for our requirements. Generous breakfast, room clean/tidy and well located for public transport links.It is in the middle of a gay area but this caused no problems for us, plenty of restaurants/bars within walking distance.Used train to get to hotel from Schonefeld Airport and then a walk from the local U bahn station. Could have caught a taxi for 32 Euros from hotel to airport.

<Content>Friendly, Well-presented and Very Good Indeed. We read the reviews on Trip Advisor before going to the Scandotel Castor Berlin, so we hoped it would be good, and we weren't disappointed. It's a great hotel with great staff - five stars. It's fair to say that my partner and I are both pretty discerning customers, and whilst the Scandotel Castor isn't on the same scale as the Adlon or Radisson, neither are its prices. The hotel and rooms are clean, modern and well-presented, the breakfasts are plentiful and (more importantly) of very high quality. It's worth looking on the hotel's own website to book, as we booked a Christmas Special offer which included breakfasts, evening meal, welcome gifts  drinks and public transport passes all included in the room rate. The staff speak great English and are very helpful, and don't be put off if the hotel offer (under the 'arrangements' section of the hotel's own website) can only be booked direct with the hotel - I booked over the phone in English, and all my instructions (quiet room, twin beds, non-smoking room) were carried out to the letter. The rooms, whilst not being the biggest, have very comfortable beds and are clean. Internet access is free, the hotel location is very central (especially to the marvellous KaDeWe department store, U-Bahn and S-Bahn), and yet the road where the hotel is has little traffic and so is very quiet. Would we stay there again - you bet. A great little hotel for that city break

<Content>Berlin Delight Our three day stay at the Scandotel Castor in Berlin was one of the highlights of a seven week European trip. We had travelled all day by train from Paris then negotiated the new Berlin Haupbahnhof and the Metro system. So we were most impressed by the friendly welcome we received from the staff. The room whilst not huge was more than adequate: the beds soft and comfortable and the bathroom very clean and well supplied with all the necessities. I think the highlight of the stay was the breakfast. An amazing variety of food: cereals, fruit, yoghurt, ham, salami, cheese, a variety of breads etc. etc. Amount and quality outstanding. The hotel is reasonably well situated for Kufurstdam, Zoo station and the amazing KaDeWe department store where I recommend a meal in the top floor Wintergarden Cafeteria.

<Content>Can't Believe It Only Rates 1 Star In my opinion, this hotel is a great choice if you're a little adventurous. The staff is excellent, very helpful and conversant in English. They will gladly help you with tour tickets and information. Rooms are reasonable size,and in great condition (at least mine was). However, there are some things to consider. First - location. It is located on a quiet street about 3 minutes from public transportation in 2 directions.I say this is a good pic if you are a little adventurous as this is definitely not the Ritz, or even a Crowne Plaza. My double room had 2 twin matresses on a double frame. There is only a shower and no sill so point the shower head in the wrong direction and you could end up with the entire bathroom floor wet. When I first got off the elevator I saw that the entire hallway was dark except for the emergency exits. But then noticed a light switch outside each doorway. Flip the switch and the hallway lights up! The neighborhood is ecclectic, to say the least, ranging from antique auction houses and ballet schools to various adult establishments. I felt very safe walking in the neighborhood at all hours of the day/night taking reasonable travel precautions. Some establishments down the street fly the rainbow flag and others have interesting names like Kitty Kat Club, but no one bothered me or tried to hustle me in any way. To me, that added to the unique experience I enjoy when traveling.If you enjoy something a little different once in a while, I would highly recommend Scanotel Castor. I would definitely stay there again if I return to Berlin.

<Content>Great, wonderful hotel, staff, location Highly recomended! This was my third stay at the Scandotel in Berlin, I go for the film festival in February and it's so convenient, the U-bahn is a short 3 blocks away and all around me are wonderful restaurants and great gay nightlife. The staff at the front desk who speak good English and very helpful with everything from directions, laundry, sightseeing and tickets for the subway, I could not ask for more. The rooms are very well maintained and kept clean daily by a wonderful housekeeping staff. Rooms are medium size and nice for one or two persons, the shower is a little on the small side for someone over 6 foot with long arms but I managed. Rooms have mini-bars (prices are reasonable compared to most), free wireless internet throughout the hotel. I looked around and for the price I could not find a better value, I paid 60 Euro on the hotels website which did not include breakfast, which is 10 Euro. Enjoy the Scandotel.

<Content>Great hotel and a location The hotel is situated very near Bahnhof Zoo -station. It is easy to take a local bus X9 from Tegel Airport.The taxi costs only about 6 euros to the hotel from Zoo and after settled down you can use easily metro/tube and buses near the hotel.The hotel is clean, nice and the stuff in the reception is very friendly. Even the cleaning ladys and janitors were nice and honest: I forgot 50 euros to my bed in a hurry and it was on the table when I got back. I was so happy because for instance In New York somedoby stole one of my jackets from a hotel room. So I have very warm feelings and I surely book Scandotel Castor again. Great hotel  reasonable rates! I almost would have wanted to keep this hotel as a secret, but however, I want to share my nice experience.
