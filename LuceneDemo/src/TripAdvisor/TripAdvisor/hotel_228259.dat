<Content>Nice location This hotel gave excellent value for money. The rooms were clean and comfortable and breakfast was very good. Our room was sometimes on the chilly side, due to the fact it was very big and quite a lot of heat was lost out of the windows. Hot water could be a problem in the mornings when everyone was taking a shower.The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom, although quite small, was very clean. The staff were quite friendly and the hotel was well located for shopping, eating out etc. As with past experiences, it would appear that some folk expect too much for what they pay. We were on a fairly cheap and cheerful break and feel we got what we paid for.

<Content>Great Value A group of 14 which included our elderly parents booked two nights stay at this holet. The rooms ranged from fab to great to ok. Its well worth paying the extra 10 euro to upgrade as the rooms were really lovely. Some of our group stayed on the 1st floor and said there was a strange smell. Our rooms were large warm and clean. Breakfast was an added bonus when it only cost 40 euro each per night . The hotel was very central with a lovely pub next door serving good food and wonderful cocktails !.The staff were helpful and friendly,We were all really impressed with our stay at the hotel, my sister previously stayed in an expensive hotel (150 each per night) and has said the next time she travels to Berlin she would stay in this hotel.

<Content>Lovely hotel, but think we were overcharged I liked the look and atmosphere in this hotel. The reception area has a large nineteen thirties oak panelled marble floored vestibule with a huge marble fire place, free (slow) internet and German language newspapers.Our room was very comfortable (had a hard time getting up and out sometimes as it was so nice), newly carpeted and furnished. Lovely comfy beds and a huge balcony, I found the staff friendly but their English limited. Breakfast was plentiful, lots of choice and very nice.My only criticism is that we booked a superior suite and I'm not sure we were given one as our room was very small and stuck right up in a garret with a low ceiling. We were a bit confused about our bill as it was in German and a small discount had been taken off but we worked out on the way to the airport that we had still been charged for a superior suite.I would have given them a rave review otherwise as it was a nice hotel but do check your bill and query your room when you arrive if it's not what you were expecting.

<Content>Shabby hotel Stayed here with my husband and daughter in June 2008. Our first impressions were not good. The reception area is old and small. We didn't take the lift so took the stairs to our room. The first two floors are all occupied by doctors rooms along smelly corridors. With trepidation, we opened the door to our room and were surprised to find an enoromous room with a double and single bed, two huge sofas, two wardrobes, table and chairs. The bed linen was white and clean. However there was no kettle and the only option of a cuppa was from the machine in the dingy reception area. There was a very high step into the shower. It was quite dangerous when wet. It certainly would not suit an older person. The breakfast was adequate though the staff seemed unfriendly.The only positive thing about the hotel was the location. It was only 10 minutes walk to the main shopping area, Kurfurstendaam. I would not reccomend this hotel to my friends.

<Content>Convenient Hotel My partner and I stayed at this hotel for four nights. The room was adequate and a reasonable size.The hotel was clean and provided a large varied breakfast which was changed slightly during our stay.The only downside was that our room was at the front of the building and there was noise early in the morning from bin men and vans delivering goods.We were allowed to leave our bags all day before checking in later in the afternoon.There are no double beds in this hotel according to the receptionist but two singles can be pushed together.A good location for buses and U Bahn.

<Content>Find something else The receptionists ranged from quite rude (one particular lady) to somewhat helpful (the African man).- There was no ventilation in the sleeping room, there were no fire alarms (isn't this mandatory in the EU?). There was some partying outside the window through the whole week, until 4:30 in the morning and when there is no ventilation, well...- The safe didn't work as described on the note. When I brought this to the staffs attention for the second time, the next to last day we were staying there, I was talked down to.- The bath room floor needed huge repairs as it was damaged by damp. It was so bad that when you stepped on one side of the shower cabinet, the floor visibly raised itself on the other side. It was, to put it mildly, Squishy.The hotel was placed far away from most of the central sites you would want to see when visiting such a nice city as Berlin, although this is not the staff's fault.I have travelled all over the northern hemisphere for 35 years, on business and vacation, and apart from one hotel in Birmingham, England, I must say that this is the worst hotel I have stayed in ever for that price. Cheap motels in the US and former hotels in Eastern Europe were better than this when you look at what you are paying. But there is one thing positive I can say: The breakfast was very good, with a lot to choose between. If you are vegan, vegetarian, meat eater or whatever, you will find your type of breakfast here. Another plus side was the cleanliness of the chamber maids.But apart from that. Stay away from this hotel. Try something nearer Stadtmitte (The middle of the city). Better hotels and better for walking tourists like myself.

<Content>Just a decent hotel! Stayed for two nights, visiting Berlin to take in the REM concert. We were just looking for a cheapish place, that is clean  tidy, to rest our heads for a couple of nights, this hotel fits the bill. Room was bright, nice high ceiling, bathroom clean, everything in the room worked, no complaints. Breakfast we found was a bit hit  miss in the two days, day one the beakfast room was very busy, we had to wait to find a seat, but when we did the spread of bread, cooked meats, cheese, fruit, yoghurt, etc was all good. The next day there was plenty of room to sit, however the bread rolls may have been there since yesterday! Staff on reception were helpful, spoke English, they have a room to leave your bags if you want once you have checked out. It is a couple of minutes walk to a bus stop that will take you up to Zoo Station, or about 4-5 minutes walk to U-Bahn at Adenauer Platz. We got a 'Tageskarte' - one day travel card, all buses, U  S Bahn, and normal trains, in zones AB for 6.10 Euros - fantastic value. Buy from the machines, or some shops. Supermarket two doors down for the odd snacks  drinks. Area is not jumping in terms of nightlife, there is a bar practically next door, and several others nearby, OK for a drink and a bite to eat if you want. As a base to drop your bags and head out into Berlin, this is a decent place, we would go back.

<Content>Great Hotel in a wonderful City Stayed in this hotel in Feb/March, while yes I will agree with some reviews that parts of the common areas need updating my room was spotlessly clean, and comfortable. Personally I was very happy with my room it was large light and airy. The bathroom was fresh and clean (With a great shower)From hotel there were several restaurants for a lovely meal and easy access to U/S Bahns and BusesWould happily stay here again

<Content>Good deal, good location Great location right off main shopping strip and close to public transport. Airport is also close, like 15 minute drive. Unique hotel with castle-like corridors and high ceilings. Bathrooms updated and free breakfast covers most bases. I had no problems.

<Content>Great Location but basic accomodation We stayed in this hotel for a long weekend while on a city break of Berlin in November. The location is good, it is very close to a Ubann station and bus stop and within walking distance of some decent restaurants and bars on the Kurfirstendam. The actual hotel is in desperate need of modernisation, which I think they are currently starting so it was a bit of a 'work in progress' while we stayed there. The room was very small and the bathroom was just about big enough for 1 person!! The furniture was dated and the carpet was not the cleanest. The breakfast was ample for a continental breakfast but you need to be up early to get a decent choice and they didnt seem to replenish it. Basically the hotel is dated and very basic but for the price that is really all we can expect!Berlin is well worth the visit and the public transport system is great so you are never too far from any sight or area and inexpensive also. Make sure to visit the Postdamer area for shopping etc and there is a great irish bar in the Europa Centre which is a great night out!

<Content>Decent hotel Decent hotel. Rooms were nicely sized. Its nicely located on Ku'Damm, but can be a bit of a haul to get to the Mitte. The rooms were clean, service was efficient. Breakfast was nice and filling. (Avoid the coffee. Think of the taste of burned kidney beans in liquid form.)Considering the cost of hotel rooms in Berlin, this was an excellent value.

<Content>Good value for money Nice, peacefull and clean little hotel. Not the fanciest place in Berlin but quite a reasonable choice for both business and leisure travellers. If you grab a good bargain like I did, this place suits even for budget travellers. Very good location near the Kurfurstendamm shopping boulevard, just couple of steps away from the local Louis Vuitton and Bentley dealers ; )

<Content>Quite Nice If you just want somewhere to sleep with basic comforts this is the place, very clean and nice breakfast. It makes an ideal base if you don't want anything special. Room has a t.v. and telephone and nice bathroom. The staff don't bother you and the bar in reception is smaller than Vera Duckworths with little stock. Very close to the Uban and designer shops. Cheap and cheerful which if you are out and about all day is fine. Would recommend this hotel because of the clean condition.

<Content>EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT VALUE for a 3* hotel! BERLIN is an amazing huge city with high respect of humans and animals. I wish all cities being so friendly and civilised as Berlin.We spent 6 nights with friends, all coming from Greece. The building is a bit old and need some renovation but we loved it as it is, looks very classic! Rooms are very clean, we had 2 huge rooms with big windows and a lot of space to move around. Bathrooms are renovated and the shower excellent. Breakfast was rich and fresh with excellent coffee. The staff is very kind and helpful - specially the night receptionists. The area (Kudam) is very nice and safe (it's in west Berlin) you can walk around at night and nothing would scare you. We usually get back very late (2 women) and had no problem.The tub stop is 5 minutes walk from the hotel.There is an excellent italian piano restaurant opposite the hotel the food and the service and the pianist are great and we found it very cheap for our standards in Greece. Try it!We wouldn't expect any better for what we paid.We would stay there again.Niki Kyrarini, Eirini Lazana, Romeo Rousseau, Nikos Athanassoulas from Athens Greece

<Content>Hotel very good The hotel was very comfortable and very clean.Breakfast was very good with lots of choices in cheeses and cooked meats,cereals,yoghurt and fruit juices and hot scrambled egg and sausage and boiled eggs also. Staff were friendly and polite. The hotel is situated in a very affluent area of Berlin and easily reachable from public transport. For a good meal i can recommend you try the Hell and Dunkel (light and dark) refering to the type of beer they sell. It is 2 min walk from the hotel. Turn left,walk 10 yards to corner,turn right and walk about 200 yards. You are there. Enjoy!

<Content>Agon Olivaer Apart Hotel - Don't Bother!! Located beside a very busy main road - traffic up and down all night. Unable to sleep due to the noise and the horrible uncomfortable pillow. The actual bed was very comfortable.Room was spotlessly clean, but very tacky - definitely needed decorating. Bed linen and towels also spotless. Bathroom - climb the step and into a cupboard!! The room was extremely hot and the fan provided was not really of any use. The breakfast was very good - a wide variety of meats, cheese, salad items, fruit, fruit juice, bread rolls and cereal.Staff - very abrupt.

<Content>Just about acceptable This is a hotel much in need of refurbishment. The bed and shower room were clean, but the sofas in the room were very grubby, the sink was cracked, the shower door was hanging off. Also the carpets in the corridors were stained. Not my idea of a pleasant hotel. The breakfast was OK but it was a real bun fight with tables very close together and someone knocking the back of your chair every so often. There is no air conditioning and we were overlooking the main road so it was very noisy. The bar which a reviewer mentioned is called QBA and although it was noisy I would recommend a visit! It is a cuban bar and serves great cocktails with a great atmosphere.The location is good - nice area and close to excellent public transport. Conclusion? - Fairly cheap but not that cheerful.

<Content>Fantastic Weekend! Just returned from berlin. Stayed 2 nights at the olivaer apart hotel. The hotel was in a really nice area around 3 miles from mitte which is where all the historical monuments are. Mitte is easily reachable from the hotel from either Charlottenburg S-bahn (10min walk) or the Zoologisher Garten S-Bahn (30 min walk). The hotel reception and corridors need touching up, but the room we stayed in was great. We had a huge balcony and a really nicely laid out room. Breakfast is very good and the staff were quite friendly. Berlin is ace and we are going back shortly and will definetly stay in the olivaer apart hotel.

<Content>Good value - fantastic breakfast The location of this hotel was brilliant, just around the corner from the U-Bahn station and the Ku'damm main street where there are plenty of bars and restaurants. The rooms were clean and spacious with nice high ceilings and french doors. The breakfast was great, with a really good selection of cold meats, cheeses, different kinds of bread and fruit. It was also served until 10am for a nice lie-in. The only complaint is that the rooms are very noisy, the hotel is right by the main road which is constantly busy so it wasn't possible to have the windows open at night. There is also a busy bar right next door to the hotel, but the noise from there generally stopped by about midnight. Overall very good value for money, but probably not a good choice if you are a light sleeper!

<Content>Nice experience Have just spent 4 nights at Olivaer Apart. It is located in a very convenient area, very near to Ku'dam avenue, near metro and bus stations. We mostly used the buses which are the best way to see the town and Berlin's most important sights. As for the room, it was large and very clean, though the decor could have been updated. Best part of the story, the breakfast, which makes up for any incoveniences the hotel may have: great variety of food and bakery products(you will love the hams and cheeses), even light products for those on diet. And, very important to me, excellent coffee and juices (difficult to find decent ones even in 4* hotels).All in all, I would recommend this hotel for its great value for money and its convenient location.

<Content>Nice rooms Having just spent Christmas in Berlin, our stay was memorable. The hotel is clean and not too badly located. Staff were very polite and helpful. I noticed one review comment about the smoking, well they smoke everywhere in Germany. If you are upset by cigarette smoke(which we are) then Germany is not the country for you.The breakfast was fantastic and puts many classier hotels to shame. The only problem that I could pick would be the pillows. Germans have very flat pillows so I would suggest that you perhaps take a jumper to put under the pillow, beds were lovely and firm and rooms were spotless. Free Internet as well.When returning to Berlin I would stay here again, what ever problems it has breakfast make up for.

<Content>Great breakfast Have just come back from a trip to Berlin and stayed at the Olivaer.The breakfasts were great - all you could eat and it was filled up on a regular basis.The room was clean and tidy with a lovely bathroom (bath and shower).The hotel staff were OK, although we found it a bit strange that they were smoking on the reception desk!In terms of location, this is a perfect place to stay, as it is right by the U-Bahn (Adenauerplatz) and you can stroll along the Ku'damm towards the Europa Center and KadeWe.

<Content>Cheap but not Cheerfull! We have just returned from a wonderfull weekend in Berlin staying at the above hotel. The receptionist definately needs to attend a customer care course, she was very ignorant, rude and not at all helpful, and smoking behind the counter was like walking into fog!!! The room was clean and comfortable, breakfast was plentiful. Decent location for underground and bus services.

<Content>Great break We have just returned from Berlin,having stayed in the Top Olivaer Apart Hotel.We were in a party of 6,and we were there for 4 days and 3 nights.The Hotel room was clean,plenty of hot water,and lovely comfortable beds.The breakfast was exellent,and could not be faulted,which gave us a good start to the day of sightseeing.I think the hotel itself could do with a face lift,but on the whole good value for money.The hotel receptionist was very helpful,and ordered us a minibus on the morning of our departure,which arrived right on time.We liked the QBA bar on the corner,and ended up in there every night after we had been down town,Great atmosphere and a good local band.We also had an exellent meal in the italian round the corner,which was nice and handy.The hotel is just 5 minutes walk from the underground,which we used all the time.On the whole it was good value for money and i would definetly stay there again.

<Content>Very reasonable We stayed at the Olivaer Apart Hotel for two nights / three days BB in April.The first things we noticed was how miserable the recepeptionist was!! None of the staff were that friendly in fact.When we reached our room, however, we were more than happy with what we'd got. We had a twin room with two single beds which was spotlessly clean and overlooked a small courtyard. There are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms for those of you who like a coffee first thing!?!?We booked the hotel via the internet and got a good deal but having checked out the hotel's prices I don't think we would have paid what they wanted.....There is a U-bahn and bus stop not far from the hotel but to get to all the sights / tourist places it's a 15 minute journey by either. The underground is easier to use than London and it's very cheap!! 2 euros for one ticket which lasts you 2 hours on any form of public transport.Just across from the hotel is a lovely square with pavement cafe's which do the most delicious food! We spent both nights eating at these restaurants which I can definitely recommend.All in all, if I went back to Berlin for a sight seeing trip and could get the hotel at the same cheap rate I would definitely stay there. It is ideal if all you're after is a clean room to get your head down but does not offer much more.Breakfast is a typical continental breakfast with plenty to eat - couldn't fault it.

<Content>Good Value For Money The room we got was huge and the breakfast was very tasty. All in all very good value for money although a couple of negatives were (a) we got two single beds pushed together instead of a double, (b) the pillows were non-existant and (c) the curtains didnt quite meet in the middle and we had to fix them shut with hair pins.

<Content>God NOoooo!! We arrived there mid November. The first thing I noticed was how UNFRIENDLY and RUDE the staff were. They gave you the impression that you were not a paying customer and they made you a favour having you there. My room was ok comparing to my friend's room, although I had requested for a double bed and...I found two twin beds!! Breakfast was basic but even there the staff were watching how much coffee we would drink!!!!!The location is not good either. I would NEVER go there again.
