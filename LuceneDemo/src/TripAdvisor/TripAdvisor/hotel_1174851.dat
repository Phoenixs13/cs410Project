<Content>Nicely done hotel, but TOO far from EVERYTHING! I stayed in this hotel over the new years period of 2008/2009. It was obvious that this was quite a new hotel - firstly by seeing how modern the rooms were and of course, there were zero reviews on Tripadvisor!Looking at Google Maps to get to the hotel from the closest station (Amsertdam Zuid), it showed the walking journey to be around 5 minutes. This is far from the truth! I timed the walk one night and it was almost 16 and a half minutes! A terrible walk in the freezing cold and of course the last thing you want to do after a very busy day and night.There is a tram stop about 12 minutes from there, but due to not knowing the city or how to get tram clipcards, we only used this on the last day.The only review I could find on this place was on their website, saying that it is close to restaurants and bars - this too is not true. There is zero nightlife there, but it is about an 8 minute walk to a small shopping centre.The rooms were very modern and spotless - lots of cupboard space and a nice size flat screen television. Very nice bathrooms - again very modern.The staff were quite helpful and were able to answer most of my questions.I got this hotel on a Mystery Hotel package, and of course it was alot cheaper because of that (and looking at around New Years, most places, even hostels, were costing quite a bit!). It was obvious the hotel was not particularly full (seemed maybe a quarter full), so this may be on a mystery package for a while.Yes, it is a 4 star hotel and I did get it at a good price considering, but looking at the excrutiating distance between there and anywhere, I would have rather paid a bit more to stay somewhere more central. It would have saved so much more time and seriously reduced the amount of stress a first time holiday brings! If you have a car, or are staying there for business in the area, it is definitely a good place to stay.
