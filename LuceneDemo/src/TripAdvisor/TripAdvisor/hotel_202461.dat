<Content>Incredible Value for Money We stayed at this very modern, relatively new hotel for 10 days in February 2007. We used a travel Web site (travelnow.com) and paid about $60 a night, which for a 4-star Hotel in Berlin is a tremendous bargain. Included in the price is a free pass for all public transport for the duration of stay. The hotel is no frills, very clean, comfortable, and has very sizeable rooms for a capital. Especially the rooms to the back are dead quiet. Rooms are equipped with a double bed (there are single rooms with single beds at lower rates), couch, armchairs, table, desk, chairs, and TV (about 30 channels). Every room also has a balcony and a kitchenette (fridge, stove, microwave, dishes etc.), which is something we really liked. The bathrooms are good size, clean, and everything looks new.The staff is incredibly nice and helpful. Internet access is only available in the lobby from one computer or, if you bring a laptop, via a wireless card that you have to provide. The location is not ultra central but in the quiet, residential district of Weissensee (White Lake) in the Eastern part of Berlin. Getting to the city center (Mitte) takes 15-20 minutes by car or a bit longer by public transport. The next tram stop towards the center is about an eight-minute walk away. But Berlin is a driving town anyway, and we never go there without renting a (small!) car. The only thing that we didn't like was that there was just 1 pillow per person, and they were very thin/flat. At our request, they brought more pillows. Also there are no irons in the rooms. One either has to use the ironing service or go downstairs to an ironing room to iron clothes. Overall, it was an excellent experience, and we will stay there now every time we go back to Berlin.
