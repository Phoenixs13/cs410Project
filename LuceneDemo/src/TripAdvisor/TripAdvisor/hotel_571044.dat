<Content>Very nice My boyfriend and I stayed at the Begaswinkel in August this year. It is a lovely hotel with lots of character and charm. Our room (which was located in the lower ground area) was a medium size and had two large windows looking out onto a walled courtyard. Because the room was on the lower ground level it was a little bit on the dark side, but not so much that it bothered us. The decor of the room was very nice and modern, with wooden floors, a large wardrobe, dresser, king-sized bed, small TV, table and chairs. The bathroom, however was tiny, and it was a squeeze to get round the shower unit to get to the toilet. If you are of a larger size you would probably have a bit of trouble getting to the toilet because of the narrow access! Nevertheless it was modern, and extremely clean.The hotel's breakfast room is on the top floor of the hotel, accessed by the central spiral staircase (there is no elevator). The breakfast room also has an outdoor terrace, where we enjoyed our breakfast in the sunshine. The food choices were large, there were plenty of pastries, toast, bread, fruit, yoghurts, and all the usual German savoury items, plus coffee and just about every variety of tea and fruit tea you could think of.The staff were very friendly, although one or two of them did not speak very good English. There was a little bit of confusion when we checked-out of the hotel, but this was handled in an efficient but relaxed manner. The hotel is just around the corner from a U-Bahn station (Kurfurstenstrasse), only 2-3 mins walk away, and is also well located for Potsdamer Strasse, one of the main roads, with lots of bars and restaurants. Overall it was a good and fairly central location for seeing the sights of Berlin. Walking back to the hotel from the U-Bahn at night we felt safe and unthreatened.I would stay here again.
