<Content>A Hidden Gem! I had a very bad experience at a nearby hotel and need a place to stay last minute. Not only were they very accommodating, but the rooms were a lot nicer than I thought. I reserved a jacuzzi suite which was very comfortable and actually less expensive than the regular guest rooms at nearby hotels, They are also are conveniently located less than 10 minutes from Base Ramey Internantional airport. We ate at the hotels restaurant and the food was very good- they serve mainly native dishes from the island. If your visiting the Aguadilla area of Puerto Rico, I highly recommend this hotel

<Content>No wonder PR tourism is going downhill We live in Ponce,PR , we needed a short vac. so we decided to do internal tourism. OMG, no wonder PR tourism is terrible, price, service, restaurant, terrible, first, No AC didnt work, pool was filthy, restaurant, they should take some classes. Never had oatmeal with Felipe II and kalua and raw!!! eggs horrible, juice not even natural, from tropic juice or maybe some cheap make and charged as freshly squeeze. Manager never wanted to speak to you... and employees wel I guess they did what they were told... well that night we had to report the AC a couple of time, the manager said if we wanted he/she would refund that night so we can leave. This was around 11:00 pm, we were tired and to go back to Ponce would be about a 2hr drive. imagine that!!!. They lend us a small , dirty fan that it couldnt be any ore dirty.. Promised that next day would be fixed, wanted to give them a chance we went sightseeing, went try to have breakfast , which was a disapointment, wanted to swim , we couldnt it was filthy so we left outside the area and went to visit near hotel and paradores. Came back around 6:00 , they said AC fine , opened the doorm hot as HELL! called front desk the said give it time, gave them one hour, even in HELL , AC would get cold, but this one was beyond Hell!!. room a little shabby, We were charged a full night regular rate!!!!! not even a discount. Try to give them an oportunity to see that , well we stayed, but Manager was very inconsiderate. Plus to much $$$for what we went thru, well just by not EVER,EVER,EVER going back or recommending them , well I guess it would do. It is a shame that an island like ours has to go through this embarassment..

<Content>disapointed We stayed for 4 days and the place outside is ok. It's quiet you can hear the coquies at night and the roosters crowing all the time. Unfortunately,the room was not as nice. There was no hot water, the room was out dated with many cracked and broken tile, the A/C was not able to be controlled or adjusted. When on it was too cold and you had to turn it off to get it warmer. The restaurant was closed most of the time, so I don't know about the food. The pool was ok. The service was ok too.

<Content>Truly a paradise!!!!! My family decided on a trip to PR and couldn't decide on a hotel so I randomly chose this one. We were so surprised to find this oasis in the middle of aguadilla! The service was superb, they couldn't do enough for us . The price was so decent we stood 4 extra days and still didn't break our budget. the rooms were so clean and the maids(especially Vicky) were on top of everything yet never invaded our privacy. The grounds are so nice and pure looking. The front desk personel was imformative and told us many places that we could visit. We were taken to the airport on a shuttle and we were treated like royalty. I do ALOT of traveling and I can honestly say this is one of the best hotel stays I've had in a very long time. My family decided we are going to have our family reunion at the Pedregal next year! Don't miss out on this paradise!!!

<Content>Okay, but bring your cell phone! I booked directly for my mother and my aunt who are senior citizens. Once they arrived, my mother wanted to make a phone call. The front desk claims that I said that I put a block (this is not true). Then they added that the guests are not allowed to use the phone. They claim that the guests do not pay up. My mother mentioned to them that she is willing to pay, but they insisted that she cannot make the calls. I have to call my mother. I believe this is crazy. Not everybody has a cell phone and this is first time I hear of this. Of all the experiences I had with hotels this is really surreal. Also, the room that they were in, the shower head looked like it is slightly hanging. Water spilled on the floor and my mother almost fell down. Luckily, my mother and my aunt went down to complain about it and their room was changed.Another thing was I booked for three days the room. The front desk mentioned it was for two days. My mother insisted, but they didn't budge. She had to pay for the extra day out of pocket. The front desk even tried to charge the extra day to my credit card without calling me. My mother luckily saw this and insisted on a hard copy of the statement.These were the issues that both my mother and aunt experienced. Otherwise, it it a nice hotel.My suggestion is definitely bring a cell phone. Also double check and make sure that you are reserving for a certain amount of days.Unfortunately if it was not because of these issues, things would have been better.

<Content>Comfortable and Cozy I have come back to this property everytime I go to Puerto RICO. Once you learn where this property is at It is easy to get to.The property is always kept clean, if you want to relax one day of your trip this is where you want to be, It is so relaxing beside the pool. If you want to book do it in advance because families from all around the island stay here on weekend getaways. the prices are reasonable. the staff is very helpful especialy one guy by the name of Waldemar he makes your stay there as comfortable as he can. The supervisor is Annie she is also very helpful she speaks English for those that do not speak spanish. She will give you the sightseeing spots in the area and where to dine.

<Content>Luke warm- Pedregal Luke warm - Pedregal; is the way I feel, If you ask my wife she would tell you they where cold. I will start from getting there. First off, the motel gives you directions to the motel on their web site, but only from the town, since I was coming from Bayamon I had to look them up on MapQuest which only got me to the town and from there I figured out where they where from the motels directions. Once I arrived at around 4:30, I found that there where two wedding receptions at the motel. One of the reception halls is acroos the way from the rooms, and that proved challenging to try and sleep with the music so loud. Since, it was raining that day the floors and stairs that lead to the 2nd deck rooms where really slippery, so watch your step. On day 2 and 3, we had problems with no hot water to shower with in the mornings (this was eventually fixed each day). The motel sits in the middle of a community and is set up so it looks and feels like and oasis - they almost pulled it off except for when your at the pool you can see the projects right across the street. The motel is only 5 minutes from Crash Boat beach which is a plus. The staff gets an excellent grade for service and support. They go out of their way to help you and are very friendly- my hat goes off to them. The staffs support made up for some of the problems with the motel but not all. The resturant at the motel is not part of or run by the motel. The food was okay, and a bit pricy for the quality of the food. I'm critical of the food because I'm Puerto Rican and expected better. Overall it was okay for the price I paid.

<Content>disappointed Recently I vacationed in Puerto Rico and was disappointed with the conditions of the hotel. I would like to advise hotel seekers that what's posted is not necessarily, what to expect. When I arrived at the hotel/motel, and approached the front desk the agreement was not what I agreed to pay. I had made my reservations via telephone and was quoted a different price for three nights. I was very disappointed to have been presented with this on a vacation. So for the sake of enjoying my vacation, I choose not to make a big deal about this, rather just post a message of what had happened. I then entered the room and the conditions of the motel were not at best, for the price I was paying. The following day, I had gone touring. Once I arrived back to the room, I walked into a huge puddle of water. I called the front desk, and informed them of the situation. The gentleman at the front desk came to clean the puddle of water and explained the water was leaking from the a/c. He explained the A/C can't be left on for a long period of time. It was very frustrating to have to deal with these issues and having to walk into a hot room. I am aware I was not at a top hotel, but I don't think this should have happened. This has no reflection on the personnel, rather the advertisment, conditions and management. For those who are seeking a place to stay for a vacation, be my guest and stay. But let this be a warning. Make sure you have in writing what you will pay and the penalties/information for cancelation. Keep in mind this is not a modern/ new conditioned hotel. Time has taken it's path through the hotel.
