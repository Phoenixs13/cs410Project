<Content>Decent hotel, bad location I dont have much to say about this place except for the fact that it was nice, with standard rooms and amenities. However, I hated the location. If you are planning on being even close to some form of life, dont stay here. The drive to South Beach is long and if you hit a traffic....I guess if you want some quiet time, then this hotel is ok, but if you want to see Miami, do some shopping, go out to eat or party....prepare to drive the whole time

<Content>Be Warned: Worst Hospitality Ever! This hotel does not deserve even one star! A waste of money, at $600 a night for a suite, this hotel was a joke! The toilet ran all night, dirty carpet and upholstery, torn bedspreads, broken mirrors, coffee pots that don't work, the spa was not heated, the pool was dirty, no phone books or room service menus in the room, no microwave, empty entertainment center, rude and arrogant ownership and management as well as dissatisifed employees. The one touch service button on the phone was never answered after letting it ring in excess of 10 times. In the 25+ years I have been traveling for business and pleasure, this was the worst hospitality I have ever experienced! This is definitely not a place to bring your business!February, 2007

<Content>Nice room doesn't make up for understaffing We needed a hotel quickly after one of our party was admitted to a nearby emergency room. The ER doctor helped us get a room here. The room was large (about 700 sq. ft.) with comfortable furnishings. However, there was no kitchenette and no complimentary breakfast - only a coffeepot and minibar in the room. The property appeared deserted at all times despite the cars in the parking lot. Calls made with the one-touch service button were unanswered. A perishable gift delivered to the front desk was not brought to our room even though we called and were told that the bellman would bring it. When we finally personally checked at the front desk, more than 6 hours had passed since delivery. Newspapers were complimentary but were not delivered to the door and were not available every morning in the same location. Housekeeping didn't replace all used coffeebar items. In room Internet didn't work and the front desk didn't respond though we notified them twice. In room information was sparse and the binder was falling apart. There was no tub.This property is soon to become a Crown Plaza. I hope they invest in more staff and staff training to bring this property up to the level it could be. Every large room should be fitted out with a kitchenette rather than only a minibar.

<Content>Excellent Value We stayed here on a quick visit from the West Coast for my father in laws birthday. Although this hotel is no longer a Radisson, they seem intent on keeping up a high standard. Wonderfully large and clean rooms. Warm and friendly staff. Nice touches such as beach towels by the pool and small towels and water in the fitness room. We didn't eat there so can't comment on the restaurant. This will definitely be our place to stay when we visit Miami again... great value.

<Content>Horrible service, Great room Room was great. Very large with king bed, sitting area and a table with two chairs. Pretty good location but the service was horrible! I was there for two nights but met up with a co-worker who arrive a few days before me. He told me about his A/C smoking and he could not get anyone to answer at the front desk, restraunt, the EMERGENCY button on the phone or any other number. That night I am getting ready for bed and notice no clock...so I call the front desk...no answer. I notice it has speak so I let it ring...for 10 min while gettng ready, no answer. Call the restraunt and any other button on the phone and still no answer so I decide to call the emegency number. Let it ring 10 times and no answer. So I give up and use my phone for the alarm clock. The next night I expect the same thing but I get a person to answer and order a wake up call, he confirms the time, and I go to sleep....next morning I wake up late, no wake up call. Horrible service but the room is nice.

<Content>A relaxing and friendly hotel Unfortunate circumstances caused me to stay here, as my father was admitted to the Baptist Hospital next door. After spending all day at the hospital I found enormous pleasure in returning to the hotel. All of the staff had a welcoming smile and showed genuine warmth. The room was great, good aircon, comfortable beds and sofa. There is a good pool, which I only got to use once and two tennis courts. Food, drink and service were all our a high quality. Recommended.

<Content>So So.... We stayed here for one night just before taking a cruise from the Port of Miami. Here are the good points and bad pointsGood Points1- The rooms are huge and there are sitting areas and dining areas in the room.2- The room as also very clean3- The airport shuttle from MIA is free and we were able to get he shuttle to the port of Miami for $20 flat fee...they also only charge $5 to be tranported anywhere within I believe 10 miles of the hotelBad Points1- Not that I had planned to take one, but if I did, there was no bath tub in the bathroom...very wierd2- I have stayed at many Radisson hotels and they are well known for the great free breakfasts that they provide in their restaurants.....not continental either...this one for some reason did not have that.3- In every hotel I have ever stayed at, I was always allowed the option of early check in...regardless of the time I got there....we had to wait 3 hours for our room....check in was at 3PM and check out was at 11AM...for some reason our room was not ready until about 12:30PM...which in my opinion is totally unacceptable when like I said check out was at 11AM

<Content>You'll Never Regret Going Here! Fabulous! We had just stayed at Miami Beach and weren't too thrilled with that hotel. Then we went to the Radisson and we were so impressed. I told the reservationist that I found a better price on the web and so she upgraded us with a similar price to the web. We had a great suite and loved it so much we didn't want to check out. It quiet, fancy, and spacious and about the same price as the crappy hotel by the beach. What a deal! I'm never staying anywhere else. -Bianca, Hawaii
