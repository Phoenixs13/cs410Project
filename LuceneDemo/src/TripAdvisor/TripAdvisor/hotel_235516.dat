<Content>Old and Run Down Stayed at the hotel on Nov. 14, 2008. We purchased a package that included free transportation from the cruise terminal and a free shuttle to the airport the next morning. The staff was very accomodating. I called the hotel to get a ride from the cruise pier and they had housekeeping get a room ready for us even though check in wasn't until the afternoon. That was nice because we had an exhausted three year old. The hotel is in a good location, but is very run down and in need of major improvements. It is located right next to a public bus stop that we used to go downtown to the Bayside Park. The bus system is very good in Miami.We were supposed to have two double beds but they gave us a king instead. I didn't complain, it was big enough for the three of us. The floors were very dirty and there was hair on the floor in the bathroom. I was a bit disgusted but we were really only there to sleep for one night. There is free wifi throughout the building and a tiny breakfast of packaged, expired foods in the morning. I suggest walking to one of the nearby restaurants, like Denny's. They have a pool that is really small, I didn't use it. The transportation included in the price makes the stay worth it, but I would pay more next time for a better hotel.

<Content>Great for us This hotel was perfect for my husband and I. We stayed over for one night before a cruise and it was all we needed. It had no extra perks really. The rooms were clean and the man behind the desk was friendly enough. There were plenty of places to eat within a couple of blocks so we could walk to them all. Only a couple of miles from the port so when we left in the morning it was easy to get out.It's not a luxury hotel with all the amenities, but if all you need is a bed and a roof over your head this place is ok. If you are a sinbgle traveler you may want to consider a safer locale though. My husband was offered drugs in between the hotel and the gas station across the street! But a polite no thank you took care of that issue. I felt very safe while we were there.

<Content>Good Management OK, they weren't the greatest. But the guy who runs it is really trying, it looks like he took it over recently and busts his butt to make sure everyone is happy. Sure, it's had better days, but it could be worse.I was also overbooked in South Beach for Memorial Day, and Midtown took me in at a great rate. They could've price gouged like every other hotel in the area (the Holiday Inn was charging $399/night) but didn't.

<Content>not again I only stayed here because this was the only vacancy they had available in the area due to the Memorial Day holiday. The rooms are old and musty. The bathroom is a joke with an old home toilet seat. I got up this morning and saw a roach crawling along the side of the bed. I'm soo OVER it. Thankfully I only have to stay one night!Do yourself a favor and book in advance and research the hotel first.

<Content>Roaches carried us away have you ever seen that commercial where the couple get married and he takes her back to his place, to which she applies a paper bag to her face and starts to hyperventilate? yea, we lived that commercial.i could sum it all up (but i wont) by saying that when we asked if there was an elevator (dont even think you will get help with your bags) i never heard so much laughter, hey, did you hear what they just asked? ha!!figuring we are staying only one night prior to our cruise, we could tough it out, being from new england - no problem! so, we take a bus to south beach (which was the smartest way to travel), and upon returning we decided to retire for the evening. after taking a frigid shower (to which we complained and got the response-i'll have somebody look into that. - yea, right!), we layed down on the bed to watch a little t.v. Well, after a couple of minutes my peripheral vision develops a severe case of roach-itis! i jumped up, wacked the bugs, told the wife to pack our bags, put the bugs in a cup and took them to the front desk. the man was very apologetic and even offered another room. yea, no thanks! expedia found us a room at the days inn on south beach within minutes, although explaining that we are going from a 3 star room to a 1 and a half! let me just say that whatever system they are using to rate these hotels is severely busted! so at 10pm we are taking the bus back over to south beach, thankfully reimbursed, yet forever scorned.do yourself a favor and spend a few extra dollars!

<Content>Nasty My husband and I stayed here before leaving for our cruise as well. Our room was located on the second floor of which we carried our own bags on stairs they were washing. When we asked where/if they had an elevator the employees acutally laughed at us. Our stay was short. After using the shower, WHICH ONLY HAD COLD WATER, we then noticed that there were COCKROACHS in our room. We checked out immediately and demanded a full refund!!!!! I would rather sleep on the street then ever even enter one of their rooms again.

<Content>Feb 2004 Terrible A real horror story. I stayed here for two nights (prior to our cruise) with eight other couples. All the couples had their own rooms. My room was small, dirty  one flight up. I had booked poolside. The front desk changed it to a poolside room. The poolside room bathroom window had no glass  no screen. Soap was a small white piece (brown-stained) from age. The toilet bowl and sink never stopped running. The pillows probably were many years old. The air conditioner was icy cold but so loud you couldn't hear the T.V. I couldn't change my room because the hotel was full. The other couples had similar complaints with their rooms including a broken leg on one bed, collapsed mattress on another bed, curtains that didn't close fully for privacy, etc. We all experienced the inablilty to get fresh towels until after 5P.M. on both nights (because the hotel washing machine was broken). A total of 5 lounge chairs were around the pool for the booked-full hotel guests to use.Complaints to the front desk (in person) were unanswered. We were stuck there for 2 nights awaiting our cruise ship.Returning from my cruise vacation, I wrote to Super 8 corporation as well as the hotel directly. To date, I've received no replies.We paid about $90.00/night. I realize Super 8 is not on top of the hotel chains, but this property comes close to violating some local ordinances and/or health codes. My advice is to go for the extra bucks and stay at a better hotel in Miami.
