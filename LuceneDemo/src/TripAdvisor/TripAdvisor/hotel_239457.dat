<Content>Loved the Location This hotel is fantastic for money. we booked through laterooms.com and found the hotel to be well worth the money.We only stayed in the hotel to sleep. The hotel is 2 mins from the central station from the airport and also in walking distance of everything - the shops the restaurants, red light district. recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Seedy The lobby is a bar. The bartenders were very nice and helpful. We stayed in a double room. The bed was 2 singles in a double bed frame, so the two beds separate and you fall in between. The steps are very narrow and hard to get up and down, but you kinda get used to it. The shower was clean and new looking. The room though was very dark and dingey. The light was a very low wattage so it looked like a crack den. I didn't feel as though the bedroom was very clean or that I felt clean staying there. In Amsterdam, if you have the money, I'd say spend more and stay nicer. The location was very good though, about 5 mins from Central Station and right in the Red Light District.

<Content>Avoid this place Avoid this place if you can. It's noisy, dirty and has a moldy smell. The only upside is that it's close to the station, and convenient for walking around town. But even then, I wouldn't go back.

<Content>Atmospheric central Amsterdam They have a safe for passports etc. Bar staff are lovely and speak perfect English. Secure with key cards. Located a couple of streets from the Red Light District's girls, so if you don't want to see them you don't have to. If you love the atmosphere that surrounds the Amsterdam Red Light District then this hotel is a great budget choice. Affordable, perfectly located for Central Station and just what we were looking for. We're a couple in our twenties - looking for fun but also a comfortable pad for a few nights together in Dam. This is a cheap place and the right side of rough and ready. The pub downstairs was always busy but not rowdy and even though our room faced out onto the street the noise never woke us up (the hotel supplies freshly packaged earplugs should you be worried!). In fact, waking up to the sounds of Amsterdam is something I loved - if you don't like the fun and games avoid the area all together but if it's all part of the atmosphere for you, this is as good a place to wake up as any. The stairs are crazily steep but traditional for this type of house and the room wasn't plush by any stretch of the imagination. But the bed was comfy enough and the sink in the room made dealing with the shared bathroom easier. Towels were supplied on the first day. The room wasn't cleaned during our stay but that's perhaps because we weren't awake when the chamber maid did her rounds. To be honest we had late nights and late morning so we never had to queue for the loo or shower. If you've ever hostelled you'll find this place better than a hostel, if you haven't hostelled you'll find it a bit rough around the edges. No complaints at all. Perhaps take your own sheets just in case you're a little more used to your own comforts than others may be.

<Content>Brilliant!! This hotel is cheap and cheerful! I have stayed here twice now and both times found it to be exactly what I wanted. The rooms are clean, but rather spartan.Do not come here expecting The Ritz! This is basically a pub with some rooms above it, but the staff are extremely helpful and pleasant, and the bar is top notch!I would recommend this hotel to everyone I know!

<Content>Utter Class Depends what you want from a trip to Amsterdam. 5 mins from the station. 5 mins from the square, near bars and red light district with a pub underneath. Yes relatively basic and the stairs aren't to be messed with if you are bit wobbly BUT we couldn't fault it. Nor could we find it at 3am but that was our fault!

<Content>This is a good place. This was a very good Hotel for our first trip to Amsterdam. It was close to the train station. It had a freindly bar. Stairs are not a problem if you travel light. It is in a very convienient central location for walking around town.

<Content>Nice, but noisy A hotel right in the heart of the city of Amsterdam! The city's famous Dam, its even more famous Red Light District, and its well organised station (Amsterdam Centraal) are literally two walking minutes away. Furthermore, the hotel is surrounded by half-British-half-Dutch Pubs, Asian restaurants and Take-Away desks, and nice little restaurants. Therefore, there is little to complain about 85 EUR during the season or about 65 EUR off-season. Just don't expect any service. The rooms - though not really spacy - are clean, sheets are fresh, bathroom etc. with no problems, and you get even a small TV with both local and international programms. However, as much as the hotel's surroundings with its bars and pubs are a plus, as much they are a minus as well: it's terribly noisy there, as the old houses close to one another take up every sound. Particularly on Friday and Saturday nights, the busy area will take your sleep until the early morning - and from the early morning on, lorries with their delivery and Amsterdam's cleaning crew will keep you awake anyway.So: A nice and relatively pricy place to stay, and a perfect location to explore the heart of Amsterdam ... all you need is something to close your ears.

<Content>Stay away! Stayed at this hotel last month. In one word: terrible! It's dirty, smelly, noisy etc. Furniture is very old. Some of the staff are OK, others are very unfriendly. My advice: stay away!

<Content>Stayed here on at least 5 occasions May I start by saying that yes this Hotel is very basic, it is very clean and as others will confirm the location of this Hotel is absolutely tremendous, if you arrive via Centraal Station you will be in your room within ten minutes. Ok Amsterdam is a weekend city in the main where people come from all over the place to really enjoy themselves, this hotel caters for these people, if you want peacefull luxurious rooms to lay around in then dont come here!! I will be staying here for probably the sixth time (each time for 3 or 4 nights) in Feb 05, and I can safely say i have never had a bad time here. As for rude staff, this is ridiculous you normally get back what you put in, if you catch my drift. The bar downstairs is a public bar of the traditional (Brown Bar) standard and is a great place to start off your night. Directly over the road is a wonderful little Chinese greasy spoon type place, where tourists mix with locals alike, it is very reasonable and the food is simple but good, plus with it's favourable loaction you cant go wrong. Take a left turn out of the Hotel Bar door and take a stroll sown the very colourful Warmoestratt with leads to Dam Square or the RLD (five mins walk) . 5 star location, very reasonable, Well worth it.

<Content>Great location, clean, perfect budget accomodation First, the location is great. Right on the edge of the red light district. You won't get much sleep but you're not supposed to sleep in Amsterdam. Very clean, friendly staff. I will stay again next year.

<Content>Nice place. In my opinion this was a great place. Not a luxury hotel, but not lacking at all. Clean, Friendly staff, New and Clean Bathrooms, very reasonable price, and the location is very close to Central Station. I will stay here again on my next visit.

<Content>A Balanced Opinion Firstly , having stayed at Hotel Internationaal recently, i can see that the above review is accurate in detail (ie shower close to stairs, a bit noisy, beds pushed together etc) and given the above posters said treatment i can't blame them for hating the place... BUT i have a very different story. The young Irish girl and Dutch lad who were behind the bar (reception ;0) were excellent and very helpful with my mates numerous questions and offered sound advice.The place was clean, beds were comfortable, the location is second to none (literally) and the staff are friendly. You can't get much more from budget accommodation.

<Content>Hotel Internationaal - Avoid At All Cost!!! This place was a dump - rude staff, broken toilet, leaking shower, and expensive for such a disasterit's above a pub and i think the people running it should stick to just running a pub instead of trying to fleece travellers with its substandard accomodationswe (boyfriend and I) booked for 3 nights and was told that the toilet's broken but they'll fix it the next daywell, they couldn't get it fixed and only refunded us 5 euros out of the 85 euros a night we paid for the roomworse, the shower leaks, water runs down the stairs but wait, the worse is yet to come - the staff banged on our door and accused us of causing the leak, when we didn't have the slightest idea that it did they also accused us of using the broken toilet, when we didn't even go near itwe wanted to change a room but the staff (a 40-ish woman named linda) was really rude and curtly told us they had no room and we had to live with all the crapwe couldn't get out, as they made us pay upfront for the three nightson top of that, we had to put up with thin walls, so that means lots of noise and we didn't have a good reston top of that, we paid for a double bed and what they did was just to push 2 single beds together we couldn't wait to get out of thereso a sincere warning to you if u are looking for accomodation in amsterdam - beware of substandard, rude hoteliers that said, amsterdam's a really pretty place, just be careful of where u choose your accommodations, it could seriously mar your trip
