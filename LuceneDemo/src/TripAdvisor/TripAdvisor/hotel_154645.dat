<Content>Stay away from this hotel I have just stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Although the location is excellent, the hotel itself is awful. They claim to be a 4 stars hotel but frankly I would rate it with 2 stars maximum.Basically, the rooms are very basic for a 4 stars hotel. The bath I had was leaking and every time I was taking a shower, the bathroom floor was completely flooded. The rooms are dirty, noisy, the bed[--] were also dirty as there were some brown stains on them... I asked for the shits to be changed and they gave me other stained ones... the bed[--] were also too small for the beds so you end up sleeping partly on the mattr[--]. The curtains were disgusting and had holes in them, the windows were also very dirty and the air conditioning very poor. The breakfast was very basic and the bread was not fresh... I would say it was something like 2 days old... The towels were very tired and the TV reception very poor with only 4 channels in Spanish and no remote control. The insulation between the rooms was very poor... I could follow every single word of the conversation the people next door were having...I have said enough, its awful. Dont believe in the 4 stars rating or else you will be very disappointed.

<Content>rooms were clean The lobby is the best part of the hotel, you can tell that once this hotel was very luxurious. The rooms are very old and need major work. We stayed at the hotel for 2 days and nights and I had trouble breathing because of the sewer gases that entered the hotel through the air conditioner. But then again, you smell the sewer in all the historic district of Mexico City. I would not stay there again and do not recommed it.

<Content>For Travellers ...Not Tourists.... If you want to be part of the Mexico City scene, then the Ambassador Hotel is for you. Clean and reasonable, friendly staff, and a bar that is right out of the movie set of Casablanca. Old world comfort.This is a hotel for travellers, not tourists. If you enjoy immersing yourself in the culture that you are visiting, then the Hotel Ambassador is a great place to stay.If you want to be an American with Americans, than stay at the Sheraton.

<Content>Not great, not bad... do not stay for comfort I just went this past weekend (26-28 nov 2004)... and found the hotel kind of old. I think 4 stars in Mexico are 3 anywhere else. The look of the hotel is antique... and kind of messed. No air conditioner (they do have, but only the fan worked). We changed rooms, lookin' for one w/ a working a/c, but there were none. The location of it is superb... in front of Alameda park, right on Juarez street, a couple of blocks from Centro Historico. it's close to Reforma, where you can go to Chapultepec park and Museum of Antropolgy. I,ts located nextto a Fiesta Inn, a mall and cinema complex.... that made my trip worth thewhile, but don't stay in this hotel looking for comfort... Oh... the T.V.'s had a few cable channels a couple of hours in the night! Yep, that kind of hotel.
