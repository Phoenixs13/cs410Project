<Content>Absolutely lovely hotel My sister and her boyfriend live in Berlin and booked this hotel for our parents when we came to visit them (I stayed at their place). They booked the Honigmond because it looked lovely when they had passed there once and it was just 2 streets away from their home. My parents are used to very high standard hotels and service and were absolutely very satisfied with this hotel.The location is superb, in a very quiet street just 5 minutes walking from the galleries and little shops of Mitte and not even 5 min walking from the Nordbahnhof metro station.The reception area is just lovely, with leather chairs, tables with travel guides and newspapers, a bowl full of lovely chocolates, chocolates at the reception, a free internet pc, etc.The staff is very friendly and helpful as well.Rooms are just adorable, with four-poster beds, charming decoration and ceiling ornaments, and an impeccable bathroom. Only downside perhaps is that the rooms are not extremely big and there was no place to put the suitcase on.Breakfast is excellent and plentyful, including some brunch items. The 3 of us went to have breakfast with my parents, and it was just 8,50鈧?each + drinks. One downside: no fresh orange juice.All in all a great experience !

<Content>A great base for exploring Berlin We stayed at the Honigmond for a few days in April while we explored Berlin. Good location within walking distance of a bunch of the sights and with a number of public transport options close by. Great room, spacious and clean, cool decor! The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was awesome: the best breakfast / brunch buffet I have come across so far! We did not have dinner in the hotel restaurant as there a few good restaurants close to the hotel (Sarah Weiner, the Restaurant in the Brechthaus). Can't think of anything bad to say about this hotel!

<Content>Great Berlin experience We booked this on the strength of other reviews and were not disappointed. With only a couple of weeks notice the hotel could only offer an apartment: this gave us slight over-capacity but we were very pleased with the rooms, which were extremely spacious, clean and stylish. The staff were polite and helpful (although not altogether fluent in English). The hotel was well-situated for our interests, which mainly lay in the museums. Moreover, we found the immediate surroundings fairly quiet and nice to escape to after the bustle of the city centre. Breakfast was superb - we have never seen such a spread! The restaurant, although (we are told) under different management, is well worth it, with particularly large portions. All in all, an excellent stay. We hope to be back sometime.

<Content>East Berlin Beauty The Honigmond (honey moon in literally translated German) Hotel in Berlin Mitte is a jewel. Its great location, great staff, great rooms and a fabulous restaurant make a stay at the Honigmond a memorable one. The included breakfast is extensive enough to fill you up 'til dinner. The rooms are individually decorated -- check out several of them before you choose because a few (not many) share a bath. (None of the rooms, as far as I could tell, have phones in them.) But the bathrooms are spotless and modern, the flat screen TV's are perfect for watching CNN, and in the comfortable lobby a computer provides free Internet access for all guests. The Honigmond is within easy walking distance to U-Bahn and S-Bahn stations and to many Strassenbahn (streetcar) and bus lines, AND within walking distance to a large group of outstanding restaurants AND within walking distance to the best of Berlin's cutting edge art galleries. From the hotel it's a short cab ride to Tegel, still Berlin's primary airport. I'd bed down again at the Honigmond in a heartbeat.

<Content>Recommended +++ I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Honigmond in July 2004.The service was excellent, the garden beautiful, the breakfasts lovely and it is situated perfectly for discovering the Mitte district.I would advise asking for a room with a view of the garden though, as mine didn't and that would have made it a perfect 5 star review.
