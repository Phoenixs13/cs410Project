<Content>Great Hotel A lovely hotel. Easy to find using the excellent underground system. The exit from the station was just outside the main doors of the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were large and very clean.There was a great supermarket within 100 yards which was great for snacks and wine etc.We went on a fantastic walking tour with INSIDER TOURS with Mark from New Zealand who was a fantastic knowledgeable guide. He showed us all around the city and was amazing. This company is highly recommended.

<Content>WiFi not free! The hotel was nice enough, but the WiFi that they offer is not offered for free. Instead, it is a bait-and-switch that costs 12 euros ($18) per day, despite what their promotional materials say.

<Content>Excellent staff, inconsistent product I booked to stay at this hotel over the long easter weekend of 2008. As I was travelling for leisure and staying for 4 nights, my main priority was a reasonably economical hotel in a fairly central location. The hotel certainly fits the bill in that respect. There is no real 'centre' in Berlin and the choice of location will depend on each person's individual priorities. As I was attending some shows at the Deutsche Oper and as I wanted to be close to the U-Bahn to be able to travel over to Schoeneberg this was an excellent choice. The Berlin U-Bahn runs through the night on weekends and is cheap compared to other major cities. I arrived at the hotel around midnight, in a not particularly good mood as my airline had managed to lose my bag. The lady on reception was extremely welcoming and friendly. She immediately made me feel at home and took an interest in my situation. She promised that the bag would be brought up to my room as soon as it was delivered, which it indeed was. Unfortunately, the room was dreadful. Small, cramped, with an uncomfortable single bed and strange stains on the carpet. It was also located right next to the elevator - not necessarily a problem in itself, but it was one that announced its arrival with a set of chimes on every floor and which meant that I couldn't sleep. Admittedly, very few people go to Berlin with the intention of sleeping, but it would have been nice to have had a few hours rest. I immediately asked to change rooms and I was told that I would be able to change on Sunday, two days later. I accepted this as I was tired and was not yet at the point of realizing how noisy it was. On Sunday, I changed to a very nice room on the third floor. It was clean and well-appointed. The bed was large and comfortable and the bathroom was a good size. There was a safe that was slightly too small to accommodate a laptop. This is why I have given this hotel 3/5 rather than the 1/5 I would have given based on the first room.Some other points: the in-room wifi is outrageously priced at 鈧?2 for 24 hours. Worse, it didn't actually work in the second room. The reception was very kind and refunded the charges, however, I had a work emergency and had to resort to using my 3G cellphone to access the internet with speeds that actually seemed much faster than that of the hotel network. It appears that the 6th floor rooms are used in peak periods only and that they will be eventually refurbished. This might be something to keep in mind when making reservations.Overall, this hotel was saved by its staff. They are the friendliest and most caring of any German hotel I have stayed at. They genuinely care about their clients and certainly do their very best to make things happen. They are hampered by an inconsistent product but I would certainly consider using this hotel again providing the price were reasonable.

<Content>Great place to stay This hotel is in a good location with a train sation across the road. Access into the city centre is 2 stops away. The hotel is clean. In particular the room and bathroom were well presented and clean, as well as providing all the necessary facilities like hair dryer etc. The spread for breakfast in the morning was much better than we expected (although that cost an extra 11 Euros each) and offered a wide variety of stuff. We found that if we had a sumptuous breakfast, some snacks through the day kept us going till dinner. There are a couple of restaurants near the hotel but they are a bit pricey. The receptionists spoke good english and were very helpful. All the staff we dealt with were very pleasant. We would stay here again.

<Content>Convenient, Quiet, Affordable Hotel an der Oper was an excellent choice for my 4 night stay in Berlin. I wanted a clean and relatively inexpensive hotel within easy reach of Berlin's excellent public transit system. That's what this hotel offers. Hotel an der Oper is not glitzy - but I didn't want to pay for glitz. I simply wanted a decent room in which to leave my things and to sleep at night. The U-Bahn stop is located at the other end of the block - a two minute walk away. ( You can purchase your ticket at the hotel's front desk.) From here you'll be at any major point of interest within a short time. My room was adequately comfortable. The breakfast buffet was comparable to most other German hotels. Given my priorities, I would stay here again. I

<Content>Rude, crude staff, From the moment of our arrival we were insulted. Their lift was out of order so they decided to book us into a room on the 6th floor because according to both receptionists (and I PERFECTLY understood their little 'joke' when they spoke in German) he (my boyfriend) ist eine grose ('he is so fat) followed by something resembling 'he could do with the excersise'.  If I hadnt been so tired I would've reciprocated in a less humourous manner (and Im being kind here cos I want this to be published).We stayed 5 nights but only had cleaning twice but we didnt complain. That is until on our final night we were publicly approached as we passed reception and were loudly tolt off that we were to be charged 鈧?0 for 'soiling' the bed. Yes, really. When she explained this in detail she described how sometimes when a man wants to love a woman that these things happen. I personally check every room every day she said. Well if she did then why hadnt our 4-day-old room not been cleaned? Almost an hour went by of her contradicting herself and in the end we gave up - you just wouldnt get anywhere with her. Then she said she wouldnt charge but that remains to be seen on next months credit card bill.So basically, if you have any hormones in your body, if you have a PULSE, dont stay here unless you're a member of TrueLoveWaits. Even then you really COULDNT wait unless you ask for the 3 pricey porno channels to be disconnected...Besides all, we took one look at breakfast and ran - olives and pate, anyone?No reception 'area' to hang out in, no bar (and the mini bar in room is EXTORTION and if you try find even the same water to replace locally you wont), my guess is that she really checks the rooms to see whats been drank so the bill goes 'ching'.The area feels very isolated - a two mile long road with nothing apart from dodgy (and I MEAN DODGY) cafes, rug shops, estate agents and car dealers. No views, nothing, only the sound of the underground...even 6 floors up.The beds were two singles pushed together, so I dont know how she thought we got 'up to' anything, what with the grand canyon forming the great divide between us hahahaha!Id originally booked a place on Kurfurstendamm and when we passed it one night I was nearly in tears - it has everything going for it, even the Hard Rock Cafe.Dont be fooled by the lovely red and blue exterior - I was, and the rooms, though modern have a really cold feel - brushed steel and pale wood set off by lepeordskin carpet...lovely...

<Content>Saved by the Mini-Bar This very tired-looking hotel (inside and out) with dirty green carpet (on the walls, not the floor!) in their 2-person lift wasn't what we expected from a 4-star establishment. Rooms are similarly fitted with very old wooden furniture. What saved me rating it worse was the FREE mini-bar. It was an extremely hot day when we arrived and the staff had left a couple bottles of cold soft drinks and beer in the mini-bar with a note letting us know they were on the house!
