<Content>Can't be faulted I brought a group of several people to stay at this hotel sight-unseen, and was not disappointed. The non-smoking rooms were fresh, clean, spacious and could not be faulted. The front desk staff were good (front desk area is very smoky). Breakfast can't be faulted. I had a room on the street and had no problem with noise as my room was very cool and I could keep the windows shut. My colleague had a room below me and complained it was warm, but not noisy.Location is great, literally right next to the U-bahn station and a nice 15-20 minute walk from Bellevue S-bahn, and a 5-minute taxi ride from the Hauptbahnhof. Just watch those few steps from the downstairs door to the elevator, they're a killer!

<Content>GO AND STAY! I will be The hotel is lovely. The reception is on the first floor. I was allocated a non smoking room as requested which was extremely spacious. It overlooked the small private park at the rear of the hotel which was lovely and peaceful. The breakfast buffet was beautiful with a vast selection of breads ect. (The sunflower bread was yummy!) I would definitely stay here again. Strange having the reception on the 1st floor though! Good location. 2 stops away by Ubahn to Zoo Station.
