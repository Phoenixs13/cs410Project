<Content>Great Hotel Good cheap and cheerful hotel , I had a single room which was fine , cleaned daily with Tv and air con / heating plus there was a terrace which was quite handy , 10 min walk into town , stay away from the bars restaurants and money exchanges on la rambla as you will get ripped off at every turn ! Jules verne bar charges 5euros for a beer ... terrible! Much better to go for the small tapas bars in the little side streets esp the one by the Apollo theatre (opposite side of the road at the beginging of the little street that leads to La Rambla)Main line train station at the very top of la rambla will take you on the coastal train if you fancy a day on the beach ie santa susannah , blanes, callela ... There are also nivce beaches in walking distance from the hotel too , just carry on round past the marina.

<Content>Cosy Hotel, worth the money! Ok, I had looked at all the reviewes before i made the booking. Stayed for 3 nights. It is more or less what i expected, great location(about 10 mins麓 walk from Las Ramblas if you take the short cut. But a friend of mine who lived in Barcelona for one year told me that the short cut could be a little doggy at night), small but clean room(cleaned everyday), very helpful staff. Plus there are loads of bars and restaurants and shops and an internet cafe around the hotel. However, i have to say there is a downside, the sound proof of the hotel is very poor.You can hear almost everything that is happening in your neighbours. On the first night, while i was watching TV (there are about 20 channels, but most of them are in spanish, only 2 english news channels), all of a sudden i felt a strange vibe noise, not too loud, but very clear. It took me about 5 mins to realised that it came from the next room, someone was snoring!! Well, apart from that, i don麓t really have any other compains.So if you don麓t want to break your bank just for a bed, yet you don麓t want to share the room with others in a hostel, this hotel will just be fine for you.

<Content>Can a hotel be too clean?? The Hotel Nuevo Triunfo is a small and modern budget-hotel in Poble Sec, in the outskirts of the inner city of Barcelona. I had a single room for a few nights on the purpose of visiting a friend in the city.  + It麓s a modern place with refurbished rooms, great beds, nice bathrooms, friendly, helpful  english-speaking staff. The cleaning ladies are also worth mentioning - the do a good job. Very close to the metro station. The area is mostly residential with rather few tourists around.  - The room is the smallest hotel room I have ever seen; perhaps 12 square meters, including bathroom. This may sound harsh, but the design of the room made it feel like a very modern prison cell. There is only one lamp with two options; you can flood the room with light, or keep it dark. The sound-proofing is quite bad.  = Bring your earplugs and a reading lamp and you can have a great stay here. The basics at Nuevo Triunfo are good and makes it an interesting choice for us who wants to stay in a more budget-oriented place. It麓s 100% practical and 0% romantic - better suited for the sole traveller then the honey-moon couple.

<Content>Clean, refurbished and good value We were moved to this hotel after the one we had been booked into failed to find a room with working air-conditioning.Friendly, attentive, value for money, clean and quiet.I'm happy to say the air-conditioning worked well.Would recommend the Nuevo Triunfo to anyone looking for value for money in Barcelona.2 minutes from the nearest Metro station, 15 minutes walk from the centre. In a quiet location.

<Content>Average Hotel Just come back from staying at this hotel. It's pretty average but could be considered good value as it's a reasonable price for the City of Barcelona. I did not consider it to be in a very nice area but it is close to the centre and public transport.I had a single room which was small! There is no bar either, there is a pub oposite but if you want hospitality or you can speak spanish/catalunya then don't go in there!If you are looking for a cheap hotel close to the centre then stay here. If you are looking for a quality hotel then I suggest you look elsewhere.Any questions drop me an email.

<Content>Very nice hotel, but its location may not suit everyone... Stayed there for a very short while in September 2004 and must say it's GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY. My single room was very well maintained and rather spacious - at least in comparison to other single european rooms in hotels of the same standard. I'd recommend it to anyone, but not to single women, coz it's only about 2-3 blocks away from the prostitutes area. As a single woman I had to navigate there very carefully in the evenings.

<Content>Highly recommended Great hotel, good value, good location, 10 minutes walk from La Rambla and 2 minutes walk to the nearest metro station. Very clean rooms, nice staff, and seems to be in a good area. I would recommend it as a place to stay in Barcelona for couples or groups, but not the best place to meet new people.
