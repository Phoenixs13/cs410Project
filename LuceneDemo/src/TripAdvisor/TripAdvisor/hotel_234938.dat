<Content>Great value and location Have just returned after a lovely four night stay. The location cannot be beaten - being so close to so many bars and train stations. The bedrooms are plain but functional - the beds comfortable and shower nice and hot. Breakfasts were wonderful - with the freshest fruit salad made with strawberries grapes and kiwi , lovely yoghurt and fresh crusty bread rolls. About 6 types of meat and 3 choices of cheese also eggs and the usual jam and honey. Fresh orange was plentiful with a big jug -full left on each table, also tea, coffee or hot chocolate. We didnt need to eat lunch!!!!!Also The Altes Europa bar and kasbah resturant in Gipstr - about a 8 min walk from the hotel are to be reccommended. The Altes europa is a lovely laid back bar with friendly staff - reasonably priced drinks. The Kasbah is a morrocan restaurant further up the road. The lamb tagine was wonderful and the little pastries to start were out of this world.Infact the location to so many lovely bars away from the main street orianburger was what made the hotel so great. Only a 20 min walk to prenzluaberg - this area is lovely at night.This hotel is a steal at only 75euro a night - just go and enjoy!!!!!

<Content>Terrific Value, Friendly Service We stayed here for New Year and we couldn't have been happier with it. It's very cheap for such a good location so don't expect designer decor but it's very clean. We were given several sets of keys when we arrived to choose our own rooms which has never happened anywhere before!Agree that the breakfasts are great value - and even if you sleep in they can give you something. I even got a call asking me if I wanted anything when I didn't show one morning. Non German speakers may panic a wee bit as the staff spoke no English when we were there but they seem to make themselves understood. Highly recommended.

<Content>Great! We passed a very nice period in the Markisher Hof hotel. First of all, this hotel, is located pretty well, because it's only 100m from the Oranienburger Tor subway. ---------------------------------------------------------------The rooms are very clean, and the housekeeping was really wonderfull. I thought to find some problems with the language, from the moment that I don't speak german, but there was Joseph that spoke a clear and reliable english.I strongly reccomend this hotel to young people and also for a family-stay.

<Content>Friendly, convenient and reasonably priced I spent 6 nights at the Markischer Hof back in July/2000 while attending a conference at Humboldt University and really enjoyed my stay there. The hotel is conveniently located on the Mitte area, with very easy access to the subway station and to the tram, and withing walking distance to Alexander Platz and other points of attraction. I had a double room for single use; though it was not large (and on the second floor, which meant two flights of stairs to climb carrying suitcases), it was very clean and confortable, with a mini-bar that could be locked, a nice shower box, and windows that opened. One of the best things about the Hotel was the breakfast (included in room rate): all kinds of marvelous bread and rolls, delicious cold cuts and cheeses of different kinds, great butter and jams, your choice of eggs, and good coffee (I gained a few extra lbs theres...). To top if off, the staff - all women - was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Hotel Markischer Hof, Good value We stayed at the Hotel Markischer Hof in March 2005. The staff were friendly, and our en-suite room (on the second floor at the back of the hotel) was quiet and comfortable. The location is very handy: trams stop just outside, and the Oranienburger Tor U-bahn station is just a few metres away (very convenient for the U-bahn to Kurt-Schumacher Platz, from which which the 128 bus runs to Tegel airport). There are lots of nice restaurants nearby on Oranienburger Strasse, and good access to all city attractions. All in all, a great location and good value for the money.
