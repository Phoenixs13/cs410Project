<Content>A great value for your money!! This Hotel was opened a Month ago. Its a clean Hotel that offers a double room for 38 Euro a night! and children under 12 are FREE in the room of the parents.The Hotel includes free coffe  tea, a plasma in the room and free parking.The breakfast is cheep (4 Euro) but not worthwhile.So if you are on the way from or to Barcelona its THE place to stay
