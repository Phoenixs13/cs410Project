<Content>Cancellation due to strike We booked a room for 3. The hotel was correct but expensive for a budget hotel.Unfortunately, the owner was very rigid. Due to a major train strike in Belgium, we had to cancel the last night upon arrival at the hotel. There was no way of getting any refund whatsoever for the last night, not even a small commercial gesture on their part. We do understand their strict policy for cancellation but this was a very exceptional circumstance.

<Content>Stay if you must... As a frequent visitor to Amsterdam I have stayed in most of the major neighborhoods around the city. This hostel is located a bit out of right field in a neither here-nor-there 'hood- definitely not my first choice. It is a solid 25+ minute walk from Centraal station. The main positive is that it is a reasonable walk to the charming, concentric Jordaan canal district. I needed a basic rm for the night and this was it at 45 euros. This is a depressing property with a sour smell of smoke lingering in the hallways. Surprisingly, the bathroom was in very good shape- in sharp contrast to the the room itself (# 3) which looked like someone had just been evicted. I didn't hear too much noise so I slept as well as I normally do when abroad. There was reasonable internet and even Skype service at a single terminal in the Reception area. Reception shuts down at 11 pm-ish so it is essential you remember the Front door code that they gave you. I didn't make it to Breakfast or the common area; I would heartily recommend that you take Breakfast outside the hotel (there is an attractive bagel shop several blocks south on the way back towards the Damrak). A room for the night and not much else in a city where finding a room below 50 euros is very elusive.

<Content>Over priced and dirty Euphemia Hotel should most definately not be advertised as a hotel, not even a budget one. We paid 100 Euros a night for a tiny cramped ensuite room. The bed linen was ripped and dirty, the shower drain was blocked and we felt like we were staying in a prison cell. If this 'Hotel' had been advertised as a hostel and been a LOT cheaper we may not have felt as badly about it, but it was very overpriced and left us feeling tainted about our stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>5 Star Hostel This is really a GREAT VALUE if you want an alternative to an expensive hotel. The 24 train drops you off almost at the doorstep of the hotel. For 40 euro a night per person I stayed in a triple with two friends. Private bath was clean and water pressure good. Beds were adequate. Close to the Heineken factory (which is a must-do) and still within reasonable walking distance of Central Station/Red Light. Stairs are steep. Smoking room on the bottom floor (anything...except crack). I think the hotel is an old monastery, so the place has some mystique to it. Great staff!

<Content>Great Location The place was creepy. Clean but creepy. Great location. Tram to center and right across from heineken brewery. walking distance to Museum quarter and all that jazz. For the price, it was spot on. Private shower kept filling up. Room 23 has a bad shower - take note.

<Content>Below Budget Hotel Euphemia We stayed in double room on the first floor in May for 3 nights. The room was very cold and the heating did not work. The worst shower was terrible - the worst that I have ever had. The walls and ceilings are paper thin so make sure you take earplugs or else you won't get any sleep. The room was clean and the hotel is close to the tram line, but for 76 Euro per night it just isn't worth it.

<Content>Very good budget hotel Room was clean on the 1st floor. We were three with a single bed each. The communal shower was warm and powerful. There's no curfew and the reception isn't attended after 11pm. They call you at 9am on departure day to ensure you get up. The buffet breakfast was EUR5 per person but none of us had it. There is no elevator and the stairs are steep. Like others, I would recommend the Mellow Yellow cafe closeby as well as the Heineken brewery. Also it's only a few stops on the tram from the Centraalstation. The staff were friendly and helpful.Overall it was very good for the price per head we paid. I'd recommend it as a budget hotel.

<Content>Budget hotel of very good standard My friend and I stayed at the euphemia hotel in summer of 2004 for 2 nights and were pleasantly suprised on arrival to find friendly, helpful staff and a very clean and tidy double ensuite room. It is in a very good location on a lovely quiet side street, with most places of interest within walking distance. Although there was building work going on outside it was a relatively quiet hotel with no curfew and great coffee shop (mellow yellow) and cafes nearby. I was very impressed with this budget hotel and its cheap prices and i am going back this Sept.

<Content>best shower in the world EVER! We stayed at the euphemia in november 2001 and although the staff are a bit unfriendly, the accomodation was exactly what we needed: no curfew, quiet street and literally the best shower in the world ever! The mellow yellow coffeeshop just round the corner is cool and so were all the people we met staying at the euphemia. Definitely a hostel though, but just right for those of us who don't want to hear 15 other people snoring at night! Will absolutely go back on our next trip.

<Content>Stayed there in summer of 2000 --- loved it! I stayed at this hotel for two nights in the summer of 2000, and it was excellent! The stairs ARE steep, but for the price, a clean, private room with bath was unbeatable! Thank you!

<Content>Should be a hostel Stayed in a double ensuite room in May. Clean rooms, a few fag burns on the bedding and a distinct smell of weed in the corridor. Expensive for what it was. Staff seemed nice. Central(ish) location. Lots of works outside so was loud in the morning.

<Content>not good. This place should be re-named as a Hostel, not a hotel, then at least you would know what to expect.Bedrooms are very cheaply and badly decorated / mantained, but at the end of the day the place is cheap(ish)....Can't really recommend it other than to backpackers, stag parties, or people who don't give a damn about comfort etc and just want to hit the sack and not care where they sleep, or wake up !I had a hard time getting my wife to stay at this place once we had seen it in the flesh, would not go back to this place..

<Content>Nothing special but was cheap, steep stairs. Stayed at the hotel as part of a group of 40 rugby players on tour around the amsterdam area. The location was good as we were only 10 minutes walk from the cities main area for night life, rembrant square, the red light area etc. Every member of the party seemed to have enjoyed themselves. The staff were very helpful despite having 40 chaps there for a drunken weekend. If you are considering staying at this hotel i would remember that it is not the most plush hotel you'll find in Amsterdam but for the money it was more than adequate. In future if i was to stay in Amsterdam on a budget again i would certainly consider staying at the hotel euphemia.

<Content>Exactly what we were lookin for. I stayed here this summer with 2 friends and it was cheap, clean and we found the staff to be helpful and friendly. A little bit of a walk from Central station but otherwise it was fine.

<Content>Sometimes Bad is Bad My husband and I stayed there one night too many with our three daughters during the summer of 1999. It was amazingly dirty. Nothing like the picture shown on the internet. We are forever grateful to Ismael for directing us to the Hotel Asterisk the next day.Kate Noah and family

<Content>Dirty room, grouchy staff, look elsewhere We stayed in this hotel during summer 2001. The room was nothing like the picture on the website -- ok, maybe the room looked clean once -- after it was refurbished.The positives, a decent bathroom. The negatives: floor, bedding, and bed looked like they'd rarely been cleaned.The staff seemed to resent any questions. The night people were worse than the day; they'd have a private conversation on the phone for 20 minutes while people waited for service.I won't stay here again.
