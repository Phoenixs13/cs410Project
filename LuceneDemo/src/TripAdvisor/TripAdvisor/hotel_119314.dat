<Content>Best place to stay in Metro Center Area I'm from texas and I travel to Arizona (Phoenix MetroCenter area ) occasionally. Out of all the hotels and motels in this area, the MainStay suites was the best place to stay. The staff is great, the rooms are awesome with full sized refridgerators and stove tops. This makes it easy for me to stay here for weeks at a time.

<Content>Uncooperative and unorganized staff When I arrived at this hotel and went to check in I was rudely told that I did not have a room reserved. There was no offer for me to check in, so I left and walked over to Townplace Suites who were very kind and charged less than Mainstay. I was surprized to see that I was charged for the room even though I did not stay there.. When I called to question the bill a horel representitive said that I should have checked in even though I was told I did not have a reservation, and that is why I was considered a no show. She would not reverse charges. I stated that I was not a no show and that I did in fact try to check in. She raised her voice and told me that I was a no show and that is why my credit card was charged without my authorizatrion. I am sooo concerned that my credit card is compromised by this rude staff. DO NOT GIVE THIS HOTEL YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER..

<Content>so so I reserved three rooms a suite with two queen beds. Upon check in we found out that one of the rooms was destroyed by a previous tenant and was uninhabitable, the clerk told us that she only had four rooms that were a two queen suite and that we could get a king suite for a discount. WE got ten dollars off. IT was a small room with a kitchenette. One king bed and a sofa bed single. we have four people in our family two teenage girls could not share this bed at all. my youngest daughter slept in the king with my husband and I. Second the air conditioner worked but only by the sofa bed NO VENTILATION AT ALL. It was hot and stuffy in the room, we did not have a good night sleep at all. WOULD NOT STAY HERE AGAIN, NOT IN A GOOD AREA OF PHOENIX. LUCKILY WE ONLY STAYED ONE NIGHT THANK GOD. DO NOT STAY HERE AT ALL

<Content>Great find! Very pleasantly surprised to discover a sweet, clean, modern room on a chance stay using hotel points! A great location if you're on your way north but find it too late to keep driving. Off the freeway enough to keep noise at bay. A little unknown gem in the Choice Hotel chain.

<Content>Frequent Guest - Great Hotel for Price $ Great Staff  Hotel. Conveniently located in North Phx area. I stay at this hotel 2-3 days each week for business for the past 2 yrs  LOVE it. Front Desk  Housekeeping staff are wonderful  know who I am. Open spacious rooms with fully equipped kitchen allows me to eat in  not spend a lot on going out to eat. I have referred numerous business associates  friends  they also really enjoyed it. Yum Yum - cookies baked nightly  like those frequent traveler points that this hotel offers.

<Content>Be careful of theft. I stayed at this hotel for a business trip in Nov. 2004. It is a clean hotel, with nice rooms, and I had stayed at this hotel when it was Sierra Suites twice before, with no problems. My experience this time included theft from my room. The hotel manager did not believe that this could have occurred. There were 8 of us in 8 separate rooms on the first floor. We were working nights and the hotel staff was aware of this. Since we worked nights, we slept during the day. The windows in 6 of our 8 rooms had been set up so that they were not secured, which was found after I had been ripped off. It was obvious that the screen had been removed and the room entered through the window. Phoenix Police were called to the room and it was apparent to them that the burglary occurred as described. Still, the hotel would not acknowledge that this could have occurred.I was disappointed in the hotel manager and her handling of this incident. It was implied that I was a liar and making up the entire story. I would not recommend that anyone stay at this hotel since I'm sure the employee who set this up was never found out. Find a different place to stay when visiting the Phoenix area.
