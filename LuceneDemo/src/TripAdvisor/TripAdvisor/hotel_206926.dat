<Content>Fantastic Reding We spent ten days at the Reding to celebrate my 70th birthday.We had a wonderful time .The hotel was super clean, breakfast amazing.The staff were very friendly , one or two an absolute joy , with such enthusiasm for what we planned to do with our days . They all spoke good English, much better than my feeble attempt at a few words of Catalan.Suggestions from them for our trips resulted in a visit to Palau de la Musica Catalana which is a must for anyone visiting the city but had not been on out list . Also a day on the train to take the trip to Montserrat and the monastery . What a scary cable car ride but well worth it and some brilliant photographs from the top . Our first day coincided with the local festival and in the evening we joined in the parada around the streets . We never felt threatened on our walks around the city and saw no evidence of the pick pockets we were warned about but then we were very careful. We found some great eating places , Tapas Gaudi being the one we went back to . We enjoyed our evening wanders down Las Ramblas to Port Vell and on our last night we sat and watched the world go by while drinking our huge glass of Sangria. In fact the whole holiday was everything we could have wished for .

<Content>Nice Hotel - Great Location We started our two week Spain vacation in Barcelona at Hotel Reding. Nice clean rooms and friendly front desk staff that spoke very good english. We arrived at 11am and we were able to get our room right away, which was great since we just got off an overnight flight. The location was fantastic, easy walking distance to Las Ramblas and many great areas. Also one block from the metro station Universitat. We were able to get everywhere we wanted very easity via the metro. Nice cafe for quick coffee and crossiant in the morning.

<Content>very central location The Hotel can be accessed from airport by 25 min train ride. Station is Passeig De Gracia. One stop after Barcelona Sants, then a 10 min walk to Hotel. There are many exits from the station so this can be confusing. A better option may be the Airbus that stops at Plaza Universitat which is just 2 mins from Hotel and will take around 35 mins.The hotel has a secure door for entry so you need to buzz in for added security.What I did not like about the hotel was safety deposit box was extra at eur4.50 per day. I normally expect this to be free in rooms, but perhaps is the norm in Spain. There also seemed to be some noise comming from other rooms so I presume the walls are not to sound proofed but not excessive.The front desk was very friendly  efficiant and very good english spoken. The rooms were clean and not to small. Bathroom bright and large. View from front windows look straight into appartmnets accross small road so not to private with curtains open. Double bed was 2 singles pushed together though may not be in all rooms.The breakfast buffett is very good and well stocked with continental and hot choices, sweets etc. Very impressed. Also the Filipino lady working in the breakfast area was just so friendly. Many bars and restaurants near by. Las Ramblas is a few mins walk as is Pl Catalunya and adjacents shopping district.

<Content>This must be the place The hotel has an ideal situation, very close to the main squares (Catalunya and Universitet) and easy walking distance of the 'walking street' (Ramblas) but with most of the bus and underground services within 400 metres. (Get a Barcelona card at the airport from the Tourist Office and even save some money on the airport bus into town).The staff are very good and their english is completely satisfactory. The rooms have just been refurbished to a very high standard with excellent lighting. Including breakfast is well worth while. It is substantial and means you can browse/snack during the day and save yourself for a great meal in the evening at any one of a hundred places.I will be going back d.v.

<Content>Modest and nice We stayed at the hotel for four nights in March 2008. The hotel was nice and modest. The staff, especially the ladies, spoke good English. We chose to book the room with breakfast was included and that was a good choice, breakfast was good with jamon serrano and delicious juices and... Yummy.The hotel is located on a small street with some bars, restaurants and tapas places near-by. The location is great, the hotel is within a walking distance to La Ramblas, Placa de Catalunya, the El Corte Ingles department store and two subway stations. Our room was on the top floor (fifth floor) and we heard some occasional noise from outside and the other rooms but most of the time it was quiet. The room was OK. I read from an earlier review that the beds are really firm and that was true! They were a bit too firm for me but if you like firm beds then it's no problem. We booked a non-smoking room but there was an ashtray in the room and a strong deodoriser smell when we arrived, but no cigarrette smell. There was plenty of cupboard space and the bathroom was nice and spacious. However, you had to pay extra if you wanted to use the safe.I would say that this hotel is a good, decent place for staying. Nothing remarkably special, nothing remarkably terrible. Nice and modest.

<Content>Clean  Central but quiet location. We had a 1st floor room at the back and could hear no noise at all. The room was a little on the small size and rather plain  clinical, but it was spotlessly clean, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom spacious with a bath as well as shower (though it had irritatingly noisy sliding doors). Breakfasts quite good (if a bit expensive - 12 euros). There is a good-sized comfortable lounge on the 1st floor. Staff spoke good English and were helpful.We didn't have dinner in the hotel but on two occasions used the Gravina across the road. The restaurant here opens at 7.30pm (most restaurants don't open till 8.30pm or 9pm). The service is courteous and the fish excellent, while the price is very reasonable with water and appetizers free.In eating places, don't place a coat containing a wallet over the back of a chair. We did this once, and the wallet was pinched even though the pocket was zipped up.Although it was late November, the weather was quite mild  sunny.

<Content>Great Location in Barcelona We stayed at the Hotel Reding in Barcelona because it is part of the Occidental family of hotels and resorts. It is located only a few blocks from The Rumblas.The rooms were nice, though with few amenities. There was instant coffee in the rooms, but it cost to replace it. The rooms were clean and the access was very nice. The staff spoke fine english and were helpful on many subjects.

<Content>Hotel Reding Barcelona The location and price were excellent. Being just off a main street near Plaza Catalu帽a allowed for the convenience of getting around yet didn'y bring with it the traffic noise. Friendly staff and worked effectivly.

<Content>Very Mixed Blessings at this Hotel Upon arrival greeted by haughty and monosyllabic staff who explained absolutely nothing about the hotel's facilities and offered not a word of welcome nor volunteered help with baggage. Very few smiles here. The public rooms are very cramped especially the dining room in the basement. I didn't even realise that there was a lounge on the first floor. I am a single traveller and after my experience at check in was half expecting a tiny cell like room however I have to say I had a decent sized twin room which (apart from dirty curtains and nets which stank of nicotine) was clean with good bathroom. The bed however was extremely hard and uncomfortable. I had paid a hefty single supplement for the pleasure! The only good things I have to say is that the breakfasts were very good with a wide choice of well presented food and there was also a very pleasant lady in charge of serving breakfasts which I have to say made all the difference. The hotel is in a good central location however I do wish I had chosen one of the other many hotels available Barcelona and will not return to the Reding.

<Content>Not Good! This hotel is in a great location and the staff is nice, that's the only positive components.When we arrived in our room the bathroom was locked, so the maid came in  spent 30 minutes trying to pick the lock. We only recieved 2 towels everyday of our trip. You can't keep your curtains open if you don't want people leering in your room, it's right across from the H10 Gravina Hotel (which is MUCH nicer, we stayed there last time). The room itself was small  only 2 twin beds were avaiable, they DID NOT join together well! The decor is old  run down. And the walls are thin, we constantly heard people in the hallway and street traffic kept us up at night.Also, my husband  his co-worker were there for a conference and only recieved 1 of 3 wake up calls (the one that was made came 30 minutes late). This resulted in them being late on a day they were supposed to speak, very bad situation!I do not reccomend this hotel, unless there is no other option! This was kind of the case for us since all the hotels were full during the week we came. We (myself  co-workers wife) finally stopped tipping the maid - it just didn't seem to make a difference. This is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at, certainly the worst in Europe-and it wasn't the cheapest. Amber Seattle, WA

<Content>excellent hotel Stayed for 3 nights at the Reding Hotel with a friend. We found the accommodation excellent value for money, the room was spotlessly clean, the Reception staff were friendly and helpful. When we reported that our shower head had fallen off, we found that it had been replaced inside one hour of reporting it ! The location is very good, being within 5/10 mins walk of Place Catalunya where the Airport bus stops and the Tourist bus originates.We were lucky to have breakfast included and again cannot fault the selection available.Yes, the street is noisy, but i have found this is par for the course with many City hotels in several different countries.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a value short break in Barcelona.

<Content>Avoid at all costs!! Stayed at Hotel Reding for 3 nights in June 2006 with a friend.Firstly, the noise at night is incredible, from both within the hotel (could hear what was going on in the next room and even on the stairs/lift area) and from outside, even though the hotel is on a side street.Secondly, the staff in this hotel are very rude. At first they seemed fine, saying hello etc., but on our third and final night I came back to the hotel to find that my nightwear was missing from in my bed. (When I say ' in the bed' we had two thin white sheets to sleep under) I'd left it on the top in full view, but had to assume it had gone with the laundry somehow. I went to Reception to report it and was staggered by the response. The receptionist was rude, shrugged it off and said 'oh well, must have gone to the laundry' and offered no help at all despite me repeating the issue. I had to sleep in my travelling home clothes and noone came up to the room to apologise. I received an email saying they'd send my nightwear on but it didn't arrive, and subsequent contact with the hotel has been ignored.On the plus side, the location is quite good and we didn't feel in danger at any time walking backward and forward to the hotel.

<Content>Loved the central location. Good modern hotel for the price! Good standard for a 3 star in central Barcelona! About 3 minutes walk to Las Ramblas, and an ideal base for exploring the city. Good breakfasts, clean modern rooms, good service and friendly staff. Very secure door entry system to the hotel. Only gripe is the sound proofing in the rooms, you could here your next door neighbour's alarm call! Would possibly stay here again on a return trip to the city!

<Content>An execellent choice! Just got back from Barcelona; it's a fabulous city with umpteen hotels - so it can be hard to choose your hotel before you visit, especially if you are on a tight budget. We got lucky with the Reding, which I would recommend to anyone.This is not 'five-star' in terms of luxury, but if you are on a short break with so much to see and do, how much time will you spend in your room? I give it five stars for the following reasons:LOCATION - very near one metro and a short stroll to another metro, the Ramblas, Placa Catalunya, Gothic Quarter etc, various eateries, bars  shops, Located on a quiet side street but easy to find. PRICE - very reasonable considering where you are and what you get. STAFF - very helpful, efficient and friendly. ROOM - fairly small yet clean, modern  comfortable, with a very nice bathroom and a large balcony - unexpected and most welcome in the 19 degree sunshine we experienced! BAR/RESTAURANT - we got breakfast in with the deal. Plenty of choice and good quality. Bar is cheap if you fancy a drink on your way in or out. We had a fab time and would return here without a doubt!

<Content>Nice hotel I spent there 5 nights with my boyfriend at the end of November and was quite satisfied with the overall service quality.The Hotel is really very well located, a few minutes from Las Ramblas and Catalunya square and only a few meters away form the Universitat underground station. The street of the Hotel, carrer de Gravina, is small and silent, which is really a great advantage in such a noisy city as Barcelona! Actually, you are downtown but without the incredible traffic of carrer de Pelai and its shops, which are just round the corner.While booking online, I had asked for a king size bedroom instead of two twin beds; since our plane was delayed, we arrived late at night and all king size rooms had already been given away, but the following day we were offered to change the room and to move to a different one - with a king size bad as we had asked. Both rooms we had were large and seemed recently renovated. Bathrooms were new and big enough, with very nice bath amenities (bath foam, shampoo, and so forth) by ETRO. Cleanliness sememd ok as well.The staff was very helpful and on arrival we were overwhelmed with city maps, information leaflates and so forth; we were even given a voucher allowing us to buy the Barcelona card with 5 euros discount!The only negative aspects about this hotel seem to be related to the breakfast (much too expensive - 10 euros a person... it is much better to have a coffee and croissant outside the hotel) and to the safe (you have to pay something like 4 euros a day if you want to use it, but it is written nowhere, unfortunately). We also experienced some problems with noise coming from other rooms and from maids who used to shout a bit too early in the morning.

<Content>Dec 15th-18th 2005 I chose this hotel to celebrate my and my old man's silver, our 25th, wedding anniversary. It had clean and tidy rooms with comfortable furnishings although the bed was very firm which might not suit all but was fine for me. Good location in quiet side street very close to Ramblas, MACBA and Gaudi sights (which I highly recommend). I did find there was a noise issue - the walls were not at all soundproof and I could hear the extreme vomitting going on in the next room which was not very attractive or conducive to romance I can tell you!!! One other grouch was the bath. When I say bath I should really say tub. When I say tub I should really describe it as a puddle! The bath is VERY small. there is no way you can lie down in it unless your legs are vertically up in the air!! Usually with those 'sit in' baths they are deep so you do get reasonably wet but with this one you only needed a couple of pints of water before it started to leak into the overflow thingy. The shower was fine though.Dont even consider the breakfast buffet. Although the photo in the lift looked very attractive the reality was far from it - cold and dried up scrambled egg and bacon, dry and curled up cold meats, fresh fruit that looked well past its use by date and a toaster that only started to colour the bread on its third pass through the machine! Only the peach juice was pleasant though you would have to drink a lot of it to get your ten euros worth. Best to go out and try the absolutely scrummy thick dark and not at all sickly sweet hot chocolate and churros or croissants in one of the many, many bars/cafes that Barcelona offers.I found the price of the rooms varied enormously depending on where it was booked. In the end I found ----- to be the cheapest (I paid 90 Euros for a double room and 75 for single whereas the hotel's website quoted double that at time of booking).So if you are after a comfortable not too expensive hotel within easy walking distance of all the sights, the shops and the bus back to the airport you (probably) cant do much better than the Hotel Reding.

<Content>A little gem I liked the location on a quiet street. Yet then you plunged straight into the very buzy Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas. Just off these is the Gothic quarter which had the added bonus of the Christmas markets.All the hotel staff were very pleasant,helpful and spoke good english. I'm very sensitive to tobacco smoke but even though there were ashtrays in my room it didn't smell of smoke. It was a reasonable sized room and the bathroom was good. The towel was big enough to wrap around you. I could hear the person in the next room snoring. Though I probably gave as good as I got!I did find it odd that you had to pay 1.5 euro if you wanted the tea/coffee/milk topping up each day. But it was nicer to people watch in the chocolate cafes anyway.

<Content>Well priced choice for weekend break Very well located for La Rambla and for airport/tour buses - but on a quiet street. Room/bathroom size/decor/facilities fine for rating and very clean so no complaints. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet. Controlled access through manned reception so secure - which seems like an issue with some Barca hotels. Thin bedroom walls could be an issue if you're a light sleeper.Recommended.

<Content>Very pleased with the Reding A very good value in an expensive city. Clean and modern with great buffet breakfast for 10 euros. 5 minutes walk from Catalunya Square and Las Ramblas. Eager to please English speaking desk staff has complete control of who comes and goes in the hotel -- a real plus in Barcelona. Our only complaint is, with 44 rooms, it's darned hard to get one. Book early.

<Content>weekend away A great hotel, near La Ramblas ( 3-5 mins walk) close to metro for airport. Clean.Friendly staff. Large bedrooms with extras (dressing gowns and slippers, shampoo etc.)Only downside - breakfast not included so 10 euros was expensive and breakfast not very good. However, close to Placa de Catalyuna and street cafes so breakfast not a problem. Excellent location. Would stay there on a return visit
