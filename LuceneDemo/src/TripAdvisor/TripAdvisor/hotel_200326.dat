<Content>Hotel Domus grew on us Our initial impression was disappointing but over the two days we stayed here it grew on us. The only other people we saw staying here were old men which was kinda weird but once we got accustomed to our surroundings, it was okay. I'm not sure I would stay here again. We seriously overpaid because we were there for World Cup. Our next visit to Berlin, we'll stay near Potsdamer Platz.Rooms were fair, carpet of Days Inn quality, bathrooms tiny. You could smell smoke from adjoining rooms during the night. We never even tried the breakfast but opted for the fresh fruit market next door. The front desk staff was friendly and accomodating.One highlight was the Hamlet restaurant nearby. Great atmosphere, friendly service and good food.

<Content>Great location Big fan of the Domus-have stayed there 3 times while visiting Berlin. Rooms are sparse; bed, TV,table and chairs but it is clean and in a great location within walking distance of the Ku'damm. Shower was a bit small and leaked alot which required some mopping up. Lots of good local restaurants in the neighbourhood. Very quiet-no noise from street.Breakfast is included and just fine.

<Content>Stayed many times at the Domus Have stayed many times at this small hotel set in a charming upscale area of Munich near the town center, museums by foot or underground. Can't say enough about the hospitality, breakfast, cleanliness and location. Great little restaurants in the area too!
