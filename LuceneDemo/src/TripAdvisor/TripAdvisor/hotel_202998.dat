<Content>Not what it looks like on the internet. The hotel had lovely pictures on the internet with a modern looking room with a balcony. In reality the hotel has never made it past the 70's. The room was clean but very dated with a lot of wear and tear. We requested but did not get a balcony room - but the view from our windows was lovely. The hotel is also quite a distance from the city center and the main attractions.

<Content>Everything you need in Florence We found the reviews of this hotel Trip Advisor to be totally accurate. The rooms are very utiliarian, but ours had a great view of the Duomo, comfortable beds and an immaculate, large bathroom. There is always someone at the desk who speaks good English. The staff is very helpful-- I e-mailed in advance for advice on how to take the city bus to the hotel and they responded quickly and with good info. The breakfast was very good. We got a great deal by booking a full week stay through a travel website. Not many people stay that long, but we still haven't seen everything we would like to see in Florence. Everthing is in walking distance and there is a whole street of reasonably priced restaurants and pizzarias right around the corner. (We liked La Luna.) The hotel is in a residential area of Florence so the nearby businesses cater to locals instead of tourists (this can make a difference of 3 euros in the price of a gelato or a pizza!)

<Content>You won't want to be in the room anyway This is a really basic hotel. Nothing is particularily wrong with it other than it is old and tired. It's not perfectly well located, just on the edge of the tourist area for Florence. About 20 minute walk to the central district.The rooms were clean but old, with ugly green carpet. Comfortable beds.The hotel is on a busy busy busy street, so there is lots of noise and no AC. So you have to keep your windows open in the summer and hope you are not a light sleeper.The staff was great, very helpful, as most Italians are. I didn't like that I had to leave my key at the front desk when I left and they didn't even ask for ID or proof of who I was when I asked for the key. It seems you could just look for an available key and ask for it without question.The price was right for us, as we were looking for someplace cheap. It is in a decent location for tourists, so if price is important I'd recommend this. Bear in mind, the price is still expensive compared to Sienna or elsewhere in Tuscany... and outrageous for what you get compared to Canada.Enjoy Florence, don't miss Sienna (it's even more beautiful)

<Content>A solid tourist class hotel Date: 25 Oct 06Reviewer: Salado, Texas USAThis is a solid tourist class hotel that caters to individual guests and large tour groups. During our 2-week stay we saw groups from Europe and the Far East as well as individual families from England, France,  Germany. The hotel is situated in a very quiet neighborhood fronting a busy, but not too noisy, thoroughfare. We paid approximately $110.00 per night through an opaque travelsite. This was the non-refundable, advance, internet purchase price. For that price we did not get any of the rooms you see in their brochure or web site. Two double beds shoved together, built-in armoir, small bath with tub  flexible shower, sink, and toilet/bidet. Although the hotel says that rooms were renovated recently, I suspect our floor (#2) is the last to be completed. The room was clean and towels were changed daily. For those whose room price includes the breakfast, it was a treat. What one sees in the breakfast room pictures on the hotel's web site is accurate. Very tasty and filling. A great way to begin the day exploring Florence.We found the hotel staff to be extremely courteous, cheereful, fluent in english, and always had an answer for all questions. They recommended the right buses and stops to maximize getting to distant places in the city, and certain sights to see and tours for distant locations.There is a supermarket withing walking distance of the hotel (Co-Op). Just like the US, but with wonderful fresh breads, meats, and cheeses.The city center is a leisurly 30-40 minute walk from the hotel. Local bus stops are just 2-4 blocks away, depending on where in the city you are going. The front desk sells bus tickets.The hotel recommends a local Trattoria-Pizzeria for evening meals. Do not pass on this place. A Trattoria is one step down from a Ristorante, but don't let that fool you. We ate there almost every evening. The atmosphere and food were great and prices were very reasonable. It is a true neighborhood establishment where the locals go.If you are looking for a place to sleep in reasonable comfort after a full day exploring the city and surrounding environs, this is a good choice for a reasonable price. We enjoyed our stay and do recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very nice Stayed two nights. I was looking for a hotel just out side the center because we were with a car, which I ended up parking in the street (free on Sundays). Only a 15-20 minute walk to the center. Room fairly large and clean. Good breakfast. Staff are helpful.

<Content>Loved vivacapital Santa Croce/overall excellent, location average We were very pleased with the size of our room- for 4, 2 children, 2 adults. Very large for Italy standards. The bathroom was also very spacious and clean. All areas were clean, the air conditioning worked very well. Staff spoke English very well even though we were in an area that was much less touristy. Staff was also very helpful and courteous. We had no difficulties at all in this hotel. Breakfast was very good, with lots of choices and the breakfast room was large also. I have to say we then were disappointed with our next hotel in Rome, after staying here! I would like to echo the other reviewer that the hotel is in a location where you mingle with real Italians and the 2 places we went to for lunch, we needed to use our basic Italian language skills. It is also away from the tourist crowds so one did need to walk a bit more, but we ended up walking everywhere and did not take any buses. So for some this would be a negative. I think the service, the rooms and overall the hotel price made up for the location!

<Content>Another treasure in Firenze! I got a good deal for the Hotel and was somewhat worried when I read the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff and the fact I was able to bend with the TRUE Firenze rather than the tourist crowd. Still at a walking distance from Ponte Vecchio. Bus 14 conveniently brings you from the Train station to the Hotel. The line runs every 10 minutes even on Sundays!The room was clean and had what I woud expect from a Hotel that is basically a place to crash in a safe and quiet area. There is also a SPA nearby and lots of trendy shops in an area where tourists don't venture and lots of good bargains!I tend to be picky with hotel but this one would remain on my preferred list on my next visit to Firenze.

<Content>Hotel is ok location is awful No complaints on the hotel. The room was ok I had no problems with bugs or musty odors. The buffet breakfast was the norm, cold cuts, danish, cereal, juice and coffee. For the price it is adequate, but if you can, spend a little more and stay closer to the centro storico. The walk is so long from this hotel that by the time you reach the center of town you need to sit and recoup before you can enjoy this wonderful and beautiful city and then there's the walk back.....

<Content>It's not the Ritz nor it's not the pits...... Stayed for a night in the capitol and found it to be ok. The price was very cheap, the room was clean and warm. The bathroom was a bit small but completely functional although it did not have a power-shower, the shower was adequate. The breakfast was a typical cold buffet etc. All in all, no complaints with the capitol. I have stayed in many of the best western group hotels but i will say the standard is normally higher. Also, its a bit of a walk though from the center.

<Content>It will work in a pinch. I stayed here for three nights in late June 2004, primarily because most other places were booked. I must say it was equivalent to an average Holiday Inn Express - rooms were not spacious, but bathroom was roomy. The rooms need to be updated. Breakfast was adequate. Staff was pleasant. The biggest negative was the location - there were few places to eat nearby, and it is located on a very busy street which is involved in construction. The walk into the center of town was about 15-20 minutes - one plus - it's about 10 minutes from Bar Vivoli (famous for its gelato)! I would not stay this far from city center again, but it works in a pinch.

<Content>this place really crawls My room was crawling with bugs, especially the bathroom. The hotel had a stale musky smell like water damage. The interior of the room was bizarre. The only good thing was the large patio and view. Very far from town.

<Content>Horrible hotel This hotel needs a complete refurbishment, its an Italian tourist hotel at its very worst. My room was just horrible, out dated, more like a cell. This hotel is more two than four stars and the location is just inconvenient for Florence being on a busy ring road and at least a half hour walk into the centre. There are so many more hotels right on the city doorstep at the same price level reaching a four star standard. Not recommended, I just could not wait to get home.

<Content>Easy to find, good hotel Nice hotel on the outskirts of Florence - walking distance to city centre and all the major sights. A short taxi-ride from the train station. Nice clean rooms, good breakfast selection, helpful staff, good bar area, working air conditioning with temperature control in the room. Would recommend this hotel as a place to stay and would stay here again.
