<Content>A distaster Together with 2 other friends we booked a three-bed room for 5 nights. We were slightly chocked already when we entered the room - it had no windows! It was a humid warm burrow with a false window to some kind of an internal well. But ok, we came to visit Barcelona, not to sit in the hotel room, so we did not spend too much time thinking about that.During the night we couldn't sleep, it was too warm (not working air-co) and too loud (you can here people talking in the corridor, slamming doors, etc), but the worst we were scratching most of the time. I thought (oh, how naive one can be) it's nervous itching, some kind of psychological reaction to the first night in not known place. Unfortunately, in the morning we discovered bugs on our sheets! We identified them as bed-bugs (brrrr), later we've learnt there were also fleas. We packed our staff immediately to change the hotel.But at the reception desk another nasty surprise - we booked the hotel via barcelona30 website and pre-paied by a credit card a certain percentage of the total price which gave almost 90 Euros. When you book the hotel, it is suggested you pre-pay a part of the accomodation price. U-huh, as we've learnt aaalllll 90 Euros was the fee for the booking service! and we still needed to pay extra 80 Euros for the spent night there. I'm still to write a formal complaint to the barcelona30 company, and I will not hesitate to take legal steps, as it's simple cheating. All together an awful adventure.And as for the bugs, we were so badly bitten, that we needed a dermatological assistance - we are still taking anti-alergic pills and apply a special ointment. I wish I have taken photos of red spots on my feet and swallowed wrists so I could send them to the hotel. Higly not-recommended place to stay.

<Content>Great value for the price, very cute hotel and great service We stayed here on a short holiday and found the room not too big but nice. This is what we paid for, no complaints. The bathrooms were new and lovely and the bed was great.We ate at the restaurant they have at the hotel: the food was top quality and the price was right. The hotel is excellently located just downtown Barcelona, near great dining places and tourist attractions.

<Content>Dirty, old and horrible hostal with mean and unfriendly people at the reception II booked the room at Hostal Paris through the website [--] for one week (7 nights) where they charge you 87鈧?straight away and tell you that each night comes out to 59鈧?. The price seemed reasonable and after reading reviews about the hostal it seemed quite nice. But it was absolutely awful. It is extremely old and very ugly. The rooms are dirty, the bed sheets very used and the towels have holes. The soap in the bathroom belonged to another hotel. The bed had bugs and and me and my friend were bitten while trying to sleep during the 1st and only night (as we booked another hotel just 20鈧?more and on the Ramblas with breakfast and a fantastic room with a wonderful view and soundproof windows). The noise you can hear in the Hostal Paris is the same as if you were outside, or the people talking, screaming, laughing and cars, ambulances were inside your room making a huge noise until the morning. The 2 people at the reception of the hostal do not know how to smile (nor even understand any other language beside Spanish) The night receptionist told us when we said we were leaving the next day that we did not have to pay anything more as we had already paid 87鈧? The next morning when we checked out, the lady at the reception screamed at us saying that we had to pay an extra 53,50鈧?(after already having paid 87鈧? for one night. Said that the 87鈧?was barcelona30 commission, but that鈥檚 not what barcelona30 said before, never had they said that the room was 53鈧?0 per night (they said 59鈧? it was a horrible 1st night in Barcelona (a fantastic city that we were visiting for the 1st time). It is a dreadful hostal, horrible rooms, very unfriendly and badly educated people who work there. I do not recommend this hostel to anyone. Absolutely the worst thing with mean uneducated screaming people working there, that I鈥檝e ever encountered in my life.

<Content>not bad for location and price we are staying here at the moment (21st of May 2006) and so far so good. we drove down this morning from the sth of france and after a major stuff up by La Terrassa hotel we walked into Hostal Paris (first place we found off Las Ramblas) and asked if they had a triple availble. Yes. How much? 75 euros. Done! we inspected the room and it is clean, three single beds, a clean and large bathroom with shower/bath, a tv and an airconditioner. it was up the first flight of stairs and towards the back...the windows open into a central air well (not pretty to look out on but quiet and decent air flow). they don麓t serve breakfast but there is a great cafe around the corner that does a full english breakfast for 6.50 euros incl coffee and juice or plenty of tapas places or pastry shops nearby. you are two seconds from las ramblas and in a perfect location for price. since we drove down we had to park the car somewhere and parked under the cathedral. 30 euros for 24 hrs. certainly not cheap but close by and only paying 25 euros each for accomodation meant 30 was fine (even when converted into aussie dollars!!). as mentioned above by others the staff (husband and wife i think) aren麓t exactly a ball of fun but i suspect that is because of the language more than anything else. they are always polite and try and help.so, in all, for the price a pretty good deal. certainly not luxury but clean and awesome location.

<Content>Not Bed Its a cheap Hostal with great location for those who want to be in Barcelona`s heart (Ramblas and Plaza de la Catalunha). Good bathroom, not a bed room. The only problem its the noise from the other rooms. For those who just want a place to stay at night its very good.

<Content>Fantastic location OK, the decor was nothing to write home about but the rooms were acceptably clean. However when you can look out of your bedroom window onto the Ramblas, nothing else matters. Despite this proximity, the heavy shutters kept out all light and noise until we were ready to get up and go out again.

<Content>Don't look down! Very basic -- rather creaky and rickety beds with tasteless 1970's sheets, but the shower had a plentiful supply of hot water. Got our own bathroom, and the toilet and shower were well-cleaned and worked as they should. There were a few problems with air conditioning -- we stayed in September and it was quite humid at night, and we definitely felt it even with the air conditioning switched on. No lift, and at least five flights of steep stairs, so not idea for people with heart problems/lack of upper body strength! The location was quite good -- very close to Las Ramblas and Passeig de Gracia metro station, and for 20 Euros a night we could have done a great deal worse. Gorgeous ice cream shop selling a myriad of flavors (including 'blue ice' which tasted like raspberry jam for some reason!) is few moments north from the amusement arcade. The Erotica Museum is also nearby, as is the Chamption Supermarket (great place to pick up a litre bottle of water for 30 cents!)The staff didn't seem particularly friendly or unfriendly due to the language barrier. We didn't speak Catalonian and they didn't speak English, but they were patient in writing everything down for us and understanding out really bad Spanish/Catalan hybrid. The security wasn't the best -- simple key lock for the doors and wire lock for the windows, so make sure you take passports, etc. with you when you leave the hotel for the day just for peace of mind.Basically, it's clean, fairly comfortable and basic, and if you're staying on a budget and want a room to yourself for washing and crashing, I'd recommend it.
