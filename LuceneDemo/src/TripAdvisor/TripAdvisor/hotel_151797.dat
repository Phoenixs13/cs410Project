<Content>OK but a bit overpriced We stayed one night here and paid $150 including taxes and breakfast. The staff was friendly and the pool area was nice. We were given a room at the opposite end of the hotel from the casino which meant it was mostly quiet, but twice (once at 6pm and once at about 6 am) somebody opened a fire door and we had to wait ages for somebody to come and turn off the alarm which was very noisy. The room was OK but the place didn't have much character and for the money we stayed at much nicer places in Puerto Rico. For 1 night it's fine but it's not great. The free wifi was appreciated though.

<Content>above average Quick check inn, nice staff, nice room (we would of appreciated a microwave in the room, we hat to go to the restaurant to heat the food for the baby, but it was not a problem, the girls at the restaurant were very friendly), the pool is great .The only thing we did not like was the food from the restaurant, it was just horrible. We tried the restaurant on the first night and it was awfull (we didn't eat anything), we gave it a second chance coming back from a long day visiting, we had sandwiches from the room service, it was terrible. How can someone make a chicken and a club sandwich so revolting, I don't know but don't eat in the restaurant !

<Content>Do not stay here! The only good thing about the hotel was that the staff was friendly. Everything else was terrible. The rooms and bathrooms were disgusting. The rooms smelled like mold and the AC unit sounded like a truck was in the room with you. It was a family vacation and we had 4 rooms and children and teens. There was no access to the beach and there was major construction on the road and on the highway along the hotel. The casino which we thought would be fun was always packed with locals. Which is fine if the casino was away from the rooms, but you had to fight your way through the lobby to get to the elevator to your rooms. And the floors were accessible to everyone. The casino and club clients always had the parking lot packed. You had to walk to the end of the earth to get parking, and that really stinks after a day of traveling and touring the island. Do not stay here, the only rooms with a view are the ones facing the pool. You can find better hotels and if you have a choice stay in San Juan. We spent a day there and it is beautiful and you will pay the same price or even less for a nicer hotel on the beach.

<Content>An Average stay.... The location is nice on a hill top that was nice. The rooms were average there was mole on the walls and around bathtub but didn't really care I wasn't gonna be living in my room for vacation. One night found moled on 4 out of 8 pillows (had 2 double beds) called and within 2 minutes I had fresh new 4 pillows. Our room was on the 2nd floor facing the pool it was a nice view of the pool and the sea. Staff ok food ok casino didn't go in but on the weekend the locals come to this casino and parking is tough. Would I stay here again probably not. There is a water park literally 2 minutes away by car...was fun one day with the kids.

<Content>Loved It !!! Loved our stay here. The rooms were clean and everything we needed was at our finger tips. The restaurant was excellent and the service was great, the food was out of this world., and don't get me started on their fabulous french fries !!. The waiters and waitress were so polite and made sure we had whatever we needed. I would love to return and spend more time there.

<Content>Great Place We were on our way to Rincon and decided to spend one night in Ponce to enjoy some of the attractions of Ponce, but also to experience Pito's at night. The Holiday Inn was up on a hill and had every ammenity you could think of. The rooms were very, very clean and newly renovated. The bed was comfortable and the room was quite large and had a fridge, micro-wave, marble bathroom. I was very impressed and would advise anyone to stay here. The price was right and also continental breakfast was included in our rate. Parking was free and it had a casino as well. Don't pass this one up.

<Content>Great Views from Holiday Inn Ponce! I'll preface this review by stating we're Platinum Priorty Club Members, but I think this would have been a good choice regardless. Check-in was flawless. The bilingual staff was very helpful and accomodating. Free breakfast and drink coupons were provided on account of our Priority Club status. Our room was nothing fancy, but it overlooked the Caribbean. Couldn't ask for more than that! Watched a picture-perfect sunset from our balcony.The double beds were a little small for us, and just ok from a comfort standpoint. The bathroom functioned as it should, and the amenities were standard Holiday Inn issue. The towels were not so great. Like drying off with sandpaper. These could use improvement!We took advantage of the very neat and clean pool area. The water was cool, but extremely clean and otherwise pleasant. There were not many people around, so you could really relax. It's probably not always like that, but on our two days here, it was. One complaint - the lounge chairs were a little stained, like yours probably get at home. I think it's probably time to replace some of them. The continental breakfast in the Club Room in the mornings consisted of fresh fruit, cereal, breads, coffee/tea and juice. It was all very nice, and the attendant was a sweetheart. I enjoyed reading the complimentary Enlish-language Puerto Rican newspaper while having my coffee. I don't gamble, so I can't really comment on the casino area here. Parking is plentiful and free. We took all our other meals in town, so we didn't try the on-site restaurant. Overall, I think this was a good choice for us on our trip to Ponce. This hotel is on the western edge of the city (quite easy to find), not downtown, but it is only a short drive to get there. If you don't have a car here, I am not sure what you would do. The hotel could probably stand some updating in terms the physical plant, but not so much that it would put me off staying here again. We really liked the friendly staff and the pool!

<Content>Was well worth it! We did not have a reservation because we had booked at another hotel which was complete garbage (Parador Guanica 1929) so we were at their mercy for a room and for a good price. They provided both and the front desk staff was very accomodating and the room was roomy and clean. The pool was nice and the hotel ambience was great! The hotel restaurant was not too pricey and the food was decent. I would suggest to venture out of the area in Ponce to truly see what it has to offer. We even asked where we could find a good monfongo and they referred us to a Dominican man in a truck.....for $13 bucks you get huge shrimp and the best Monfongo we had ever tasted!! Pharmacys and shopping was close by. This is a good place to stay and we would recommend it.....

<Content>Only okay We stayed at this hotel for one night recently,renting 2 rooms(2 couples.)The hotel was adequate for the money.It is on a hill above a busy highway but you do have a great view on the ocean.There are no beaches anywhere close.The areas south of Ponce(we were told) are great and the best places to go but it was spring break and the hotel staff said it would not be wise to go while overrun with teenagers.We did not go.The hotel was renovated recently so the rooms were pretty decent and had upgraded amenties and furnishings.There is road construction nearby and kind of a pain.There was a sewage smell towards the construction.We did not go to the pool.The parking situation is poor because of all the local casino traffic.We did eat breakfast at the hotel and it was better than alot of hotels,but nothing to rave about.The area near the hotel has no good restaurants.The one we tried about 10 minutes west on the main highway(on the water) was just awful.The food was cold and the service was deplorable.When the server brought the check, she had added the tip which must be the reason we never saw her.Find a chain like Outback or similar east on the business highway and do not try anything local.If you want to go to the beach,etc, stay somewhere else.For business or passing thru,the hotel is fine.

<Content>Not So Good We have just returned from this hotel. The front desk staff was friendly. The room was clean, but the shower was clogged. House keeping just work until 5pm, and I needed more sheets for my twins and couldn't get them. The pool area was clean, but there is no bar, just 2 Coca-Cola vending machines, no music. Very windy area.The food at the only restaurant was awful. The mofongo was very dry and crumbly. The meat that I ordered was tasteless. The kids macarroni and cheese was really penne(too big for little mouths), and cold. To expensive for the quality of food.At breakfast the eggs were not good (over cooked), the pancakes were burned.Woldn't stay again

<Content>Don't waste your $, go to the Hilton! We are Priority Club members and stay at Holiday Inns regularly. This was the worst Holiday Inn that we've stayed at on a vacation. The Holiday Inn Express in San Juan is a far better hotel in terms of service and amentities than this one, and it's far cheaper. There are no transportation services to/from airport or surrounding sites and no tours to sign up for even though there are plenty of sites to see in the area. My room was serviced only once during our 3 day visit. When I complained, towels were left on the bed. The dirty towels stayed on the floor in the bathroom, and the bed was not made. Even though we're members of Priority Club, we weren't told that breakfast was complementary until we overheard someone talking about it on our last day. However, you are given $10 in casino money for certain tables, and 2 drink tickets. If you want a great time in Ponce, go to the Hilton on the beach. They offer tours and transportation. If you're planning to see San Juan, the Holiday Inn Express in Condado is relatively inexpensive, has complementary continental breakfast, and offers tours to sites around the island including El Yunque, kayaking in the bay, and the beaches. BUT, has NO PARKING, otherwise check out the Comfort Inn across the street. They offer parking for $10/day and are relatively inexpensive. If you want a great time in the rainforest, stay at Casa Cubuy and take a rainforest hike with Robin Philips. This BB is wonderful (not a 5 star resort, but a great family atmosphere, great scenery, and very private). It was the highlight of our 8 day trip!

<Content>Spend the extra 50 bucks and go to the Hilton! We stayed here for one night after arriving unexpectedly in Ponce. The first night we checked in late, went straight to our room, walked out on to our balcony to discover it was located directly over the trash bins. The bathrooom was sooo outdated.I was totally exhausted so we decided to stay the night and deal with it in the morning.Throughout the night we endured loud banging. We didn't realize that deliveries were made throughout the night. We checked out the pool area in the morning and decided that we would stay if we could have a first floor pool view, AWAY from industrial noises. They were able to accomodate us,however, this room was even more outdated than the last!The bathroom had lighting fixtures that were such a dark shade of yellow from age that you couldn't even see your own shadow in the bathroom. The mirror was cracked and stained.... We made a quick u-turn back to the lobby and quickly decided to check out the Hilton down the road.Holiday Inn cost $160 Hilton $220.As soon as we pulled up we took a deep sigh of relief. Spend the extra couple of bucks,it was well worth it.

<Content>Okay....Nothing to write home about We just spent a week in this hotel. It was okay, nothing special. I couldn't tell that the place had had any renovations. Everything seemed old. Our room wasn't the cleanest, either. The swimming pool is nice. You can see the ocean from the hotel's balconies and the swimming pool, but I wouldn't call the view spectacular. The view O.K. Hotel is on the main highway and there is a lot of traffic. It was a little difficult at times to get out onto the highway. There is also a lot of road construction going on right now. Also, the beach is not accessible from this location. You have to drive to a beach.I think the rooms are overpriced for the type of room and the location of the hotel.

<Content>Loved the Pool Stayed for 2 nights in June and was surprisingly pleased with the hotel. We were also given a room on the executive floor, yes the bathrooms are small but the room overall was spacious and not at all dated. The continental breakfast and evening cocktail hour in the private room on this floor was a nice perk. The staff was friendly and helpful. Loved the pool. Most likely stay here again when visiting the Ponce area.

<Content>nice location, room My husband and I stayed here in Feb. '04 and we were pleased with the hotel in general. We had a room on the executive floor and got a very nice, quiet room away from the casino and also a very good continental breakfast. As far as the previous review goes, we did not think it was that bad of a room-and who goes on vacation to stay in the room, anyway? The nearest beach was not all that good-nicer ones in Fajardo or Condado-but the pool was nice. Would probably stay here again.

<Content>Typical low-end Holiday Inn at 5 star prices This hotel is your typical old style Holiday Inn. The rooms are comfortable but nothing memorable. The bathrooms are small and seem kind of outdated. In the U.S. this type of hotel would be no more than $50-75 per night, but they are charging $125 for the cheapest room. Along the south coast of Puerto Rico there are precious few places to stay, therefore the rates are high. I had to go to 3 floors to find a soda machine that worked, but other than that, everything seemed to be in working condition. It's an ok hotel to stay 1 or 2 nights, but don't plan your whole vacation around this property or you will be disappointed.
