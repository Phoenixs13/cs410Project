<Content>Warning to travelers I just returned from Mexico and spent my last 3 nights at the Imperial. The business office use and internet was free - a great asset for me - the breakfast buffet included in our group's package was fabulous and most of the staff was very friendly and helpful.There were several members of our group who complained that their personal bags and suitcases had been ruffled through and some items were missing, including a cell phone. We checked out of the hotel one day early because of these incidences and also because the maint. department began a painting project that filled the entire atrium and thus the rooms with a very intense turpentine odor. We requested that they cease until after we departed. They agreed but continued to paint anyway. The next day we left the hotel when the odor was extremely bad and members of the group found personal items missing, but were unable to find another hotel that day for one night to accomodate the entire group. The Imperial promised to deal with the issues we presented. So we returned for the last night. The painting started again and it was the very last morning, during a meeting, when my own jewelry disappeared. I believe it to be a housekeeping management problem, and not the housekeepers necessarily. I hope to find resolution with them, but write this review prior to the end of this incident because the hotel administration appears to be accomodating but the behavior continues.

<Content>Classic Classic hotel inaugurated by Porfirio Diaz in 1904. Completely refurbished and air conditioned in 1956. Excellent location right on Reforma, near Juarez and just a few blocks from the Metro on Balderas. Elegant high ceilings, excellent service and a good restaurant; bathrooms with showers over tubs. Reasonable prices and seasonal special offers.

<Content>Great potential, needs work This hotel has a lot of potential, the exterior and lobby (per the internet ) looked great and that proved to be true, however, the lack of attention to details made it a very average experience. Dirty Carpets, chandeliers and rust around the bathroom fixtures and not replacing the bottled water we consumed were a few of these examples. Additionally, the ample jacuzzi tub looked like it had not been cleaned, therefore, we avoided use. The bedroom curtains facing the street did not close, this compounded the street and traffic noise. The bedding was sparse for the cool weather and they certainly could have used some comforters or at least additional blankets. The mattresses were hard  we had to ask for additional pillows. The staff was inexperienced and incognitant of directions or surrounding area restaurants aside from the extremely overpriced below average hotel restaurant. We did have a great (hotel arranged) tour guide to the pyramids, ballet folklorica and the floating gardens which I would highly recommend. With a little bit of TLC this place could be a great hotel, it just need to be tweeked!

<Content>Delight This quietly elegant hotel is a former presidential home and later, embassy. The building is wonderful, the service extremely helpful and the location is great. Our large suite with jacuzzi had a terrific view of Reforma and was more than reasonably priced. We are delighted with our choice of hotel and have quite possibly found a new home in Mexico City.
