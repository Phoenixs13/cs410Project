<Content>Good value, some difficulties We were on the top floor, so we had to carry suitcases up four flights of steep stairs. The shared shower/toilet with one other room was a surprise. Otherwise, breakfast, service, welcome, advice and safe deposit box were very good. We chose the hotel because it was the only one with a reasonable price for our visit. As advertised, we had to pay by cash in advance.

<Content>Good value for Amsterdam We stayed here for 2 nights in late May. We were on the next to the highest floor and the stairway is very steep. Located right at a tram stop so that is the best way to get to the hotel from the train station. The staff was very friendly. Breakfast was included. The room included a double bed, bed end tables, closet, table, 2 chairs and TV. The window looked out onto a courtyard. The bathroom included a sink, toilet and compact shower. The weather was warm and with the window open it was rather smokey during the evening. The hotel is within walking distance of many tourist sites and located right over a grocery store. We booked by email about 3 months prior to our stay and paid 85 Euro per night including breakfast. It was a good value for the price.

<Content>Decent place for a group of 3! This review is a little late as I stayed at this hotel around the World cup in the summer of 2006. It was very hard to get a room at any hotel for a decent rate because of the world cup but managed to get a decent rate at the Abba for 3 people. I was a little skeptical at first as whoever was at the front desk did not appear too friendly but my friends and I got a decent rate for a room with 3 beds. When we went to our room we noticed in the closet that Aqui robin was written on the back which means robbed here in Spanish. After seeing this we very cautious in locking our stuff away but at the same time gave the hotel the benefit of the doubt. The room was moderately clean and comfortable and made for a decent stay overall for 3 young travelers. If you are looking for a fair priced place to crash after partying and in a good location then this is an alright place. It is right above a grocery store as well which is quite convenient if you are on a budget while traveling.

<Content>Very Basic We stayed in this hotel in November 2006. Pros:-Price was great-Clean Room-Good Location (right near tram stop)-Above a good supermarket-Comfy bedCons:-Shower was small and yuck-Walking to our room up the stairs had a horrible smell everytime-No lift (hard to carry all our luggage upstairs)-Room was very basicI wouldn't stay here again in the future. If you can, spend a little more and stay somewhere nicer.

<Content>Don't go!!! (mouse...) I booked 5 or six months before and I was expectant for my holiday in Amsterdam!!! Then I arrived there, I thought it's not so good but it's accetable....then during the first night I heard noises out of the window, I thought there was a man on the window sill so I slept with an eye opened....the noises continued and I said to my boyfriend to switch on the light..He looked outside but the noise became strongly from the basket trash!!! there was a mouse in that rotated whirling!!!We go downstairs (at 4 a.m.) and the man at the reception said it's the middle of the night I cant hepl you, it can't kill you!!! but a mouse has a lot of diseases and for a man they are very dangerous....the plague, the tifo, the toxoplasmosis, the elettrospirosis can be lethal...after 15 minutes of discussion, I said that I wouldn't have wanted to go upstair and I would have called the police if hehasn't made nothing so he said that he would have given back our money...We spend the rest of the night on the stairs until 8 o'clock then the reception opened and we went to another hotel...the fantastic Rho hotel....

<Content>Pretty good little place My girlfriend and I stayed in a private room with a bathroom for 5 nights at the end of March 2007.Pros:1. Directly above a nice grocery store.2. Directly in front of a tram line which you can take to almost anywhere in downtown Amsterdam within minutes.3. Very close to the beautiful Vondel Park.4. Friendly enough staff, front desk people speak english well.5. Smoker friendly.6. Price was very reasonable for Amsterdam. Cons: 1. The shower was too small even for Amsterdam showers, and the shower curtain was like from a dollar store.2. No elevators, but you have to expect that there.3. Small room.4. Trams stop at around 11pm during the week and a liitle later on the weekends, so if you want to be out later than that it is about a 15-20 min. walk to city center. Don't take any taxis in Amsterdam.Not many other cons I can think of. Overall I would definetly recommend the Abba to Amsterdam visitors on a budget.

<Content>great location... Hotel Abba is not bad if you don't mind sharing a bathroom or paying extra to have a bathroom in your room. It is in a very good location right of the Leidseplein and compared to most places to stay in Amsterdam it is very cheap. Just don't go with high expectations...Very friendly service. There isn't a lift so be prepared to haul all of your luggage up several flights of stairs (it's above a market) and there are also two or three keys for different doors before you get to your room...not bad for one or two nights, i wouldn't stay for an extended period of time...

<Content>Overall good value As a 22 year old first time traveller through europe i was pleasantly surprised with hotel Abba. We stayed at the same level of accommodation throughout europe and you never know what to expect but hotel Abba was simple with not much to complain about. Positives-the room size...booked a double but for some reason it was a triple and it was nice and spacious...a nice change as most budget accommodation = tiny rooms.-good location, close enough to walk to the center but not too close that you feel everything's on top of you.-tram stop right outside-nice area with food stores and bakeries nearby-comfy beds and pillows (which we found is not a given in budget places)-we had quite a large bathroomnegatives- our room faced the street, was cool except when you wanted to open the window at night which let in quite a bit of noise. (when windows were closed was fine) -the stairs were steep but really not a big issueoverall i felt it was basic in a nice way - not much can be wrong :Pwould deff stay there again

<Content>really fine budget hotel i'm here right now for 4 night stay in a basic single room, toilet and shower down the hall, access never a problem. It's room 3, and has floor to ceiling glass doors leading to a shared balcony that overlooks an interior courtyard. it has been very quiet despite being fully booked (neighbors are quiet.) breakfast is fine, the typical dutch breakfast, and the woman who sets it out does a great job keeping everything replenished. yes, the stairs are steep, but not the steepest i've seen here. overall, i'd recommend this hotel, and would stay here again in the future.

<Content>fine for budget accommodation Hotel Abba is fine if all your looking for is budget accommodation and somewhere to put your bags and sleep. The good points about this hotel is that it is in a good location next to the train line, on top of a supermarket and not too far from the action (but far enough to get away from the action if you want). The staff were friendly and helpful and you get a free basic brekkie.However there were bad points as well. My group were by no means unfit but getting to our room on the top level with our backpacks on was like running a marathon! The stairs are like a ladder and never ending and I wouldnt want to be too intoxicated whilst going up them thats for sure! Our rooms at the top were like an oven - avoid them if at all possible as outside it didnt really seem that hot (but we are from Australia so probably have a high tolerance to the heat!) so I would hate to have them in a heatwave.Be aware that it is a smoke friendly hotel which didnt bother us but might some people.If we were to go back to Amsterdam, we would probably spend the money to stay somewhere else, and I wouldnt take the kids there, but as I said at the start, if your looking for somewhere budget to stay, which the Abba was one of the cheapest places I found in Amsterdam, this place would be fine.

<Content>Avoid the ABBA if you can My girlfriend and I stayed in the ABBA for 2 nights this july and I was more than happy to leave. It is in a good location to see the sights of amsterdam (and also directly above a grocery) but that was about the only good part. We booked through the tourist information and at first had a double room on the third floor and it was a filthy box of heat, so we complained and they moved us down a floor to a tripple which was nice of them to do, but the bathroom was the smallest in europe, literally just a shower and a toilet, like if you sit on the toilet, your feet are in the shower - oh and then later we were looking for something behind the bed and there were mouse traps behind the bed - I felt like we should have saved our money and stayed in a Hostel because it would probably be better - the downstairs reception area was pleasant and the breakfeast was a typical crappy euro breakfeast of bread, cereal, ham, cheese, and juice - I recomend spluging on a place to stay in amsterdam if you can swing it.

<Content>would stay here again Solo female traveler, stayed here for 4 nights late April. Extremely nice gentleman at reception who provided me with helpful tips on sightseeing. As previously mentioned, tram stop right out front and 5 minute walk (if that) to Leidseplein, 10 minute walk to museum district, many affordable eating options stone's throw distance, nice fairly quiet neighborhood. Room was spotlessly clean, appx. 8x12 feet, french door open to small balcony (shared) which made room seem larger, sink in room, toilet  shower few steps down hall. Never had to wait for facilities, so not many rooms sharing, also kept clean. Had 2 keys for access. Could hear those in room next to me a bit, mostly just coming and going but was fortunate to have quiet neighbors. Was a real treat to be able to smoke in room after being on feet sightseeing all day, relief to open balcony door, put feet up and relax a bit before turning in. Breakfast adequate quality, quite a few choices, liked that it was offered early, room (actually 2 rooms) bright and cheerful. Left my umbrella in breakfast room one morning and found it returned to room that night. I rate this place excellent for the price because of outstanding staff and cleanliness!

<Content>Excellent value for money, but avoid if you don't like the smell of weed! We stayed at this hotel for a one night, budget trip to Amsterdam. Overall we thought it to be good value for money.GOOD POINTSVery good accomodation for what you pay forReally lovely, friendly staffGreat breakfast, excellent coffeeExcellent location - you can walk into the centre, or there is a tram stop right outsideHandy supermarket underneathVery secureBAD POINTSSteep stairs (not really a problem for us, but can see how it could be for others)You need three keys to get into your room (a little inconvienient, but makes you feel safe)There was a little bit of mould in our bathroom, but not loads - all above eye levelThe biggest problem for us was that management allow weed to be smoked in the hotel, and as we were unlucky enough to have neigbours who stayed in all day and smoked, it really did smell very strongly of weed. I think maybe we were just unlucky, but it did spoil our stay a bit.WOULD I STAY AGAIN?For another quick budget stopover, yes. For longer than that, or if I had kids with me, no way.

<Content>Budget hotel, a little rough around the edges The Abba is not kidding: it is a BUDGET hotel. That means that if you get a double, that means your twin beds will be pushed together. If youre travelling with a significant other, I suggest being careful you dont fall through the crack in the middle of the beds! The sheets are all sewn together and the whole place has an air of being cheap. But, really, for the price (65 Euro a night for a double), it wasnt that bad. We only shared a bathroom with one other room, the hotel was close to the Leidseplein  a very short walk from the Center of Amsterdam. You can take the 1 or 6 tram from Central Station or if youre really ambitious, you can even walk. The front desk was friendly  while the stairs were defenitely a killer, it didnt have an endless party atmosphere. I should mention that the supermarket the Abba lives above closes at the unheard of hour of 800pm. As Americans used to 24 hour everything, this was a bit jarring. Luckily there was a night shop across the street  an awesome Dutch automaat around the corner for cheap beer  kaasouffle. My only big gripe with the Abba was that they only took cash. Fortunately, there is an ATM right by the hotel so you dont have to walk around Amsterdam with a wad of cash. All in all, a decent one star.

<Content>Great low budget hotel We arrived at the central station and went into the the tourist information center. They recommended the hotel and booked it for us. 30 minutes later, we were in the hotel room. Small stairs like in many houses of amsterdam. Very clean rooms. Very good situated in the center of amsterdam. Very friendly staff. Small but good breakfast buffet. Tram station next to the hotel. Leidseplaan with many bars is only a walk of 5 min away. Supermarket immediately next to the hotel. All in all a very nice and cheap hotel.

<Content>Value for money I stayed a single room. It's value for money. If u want to stay a single room this is good. Room a bit dirty and smelly, but it's bearable. Hotel is not too small. Staff is friendly. Tram is just outside, very convenient. 30 min walk to red light district.

<Content>Good  We've spent 3 nights at Hotel Abba in January 2006. It was our 6-7th visit in Amsterdam, but first in this hotel. There were some things that we liked but unfortunately the majority of things we didn't like. Obviously, the positive thing was the price. The breakfast was also okey (the same as in any other hotel). TV set in the room was also an advantage. The location of the hotel was also quite good - it's not the strict city center itself but you can get almost anywhere on foot in a short time. Now the negative sides of Abba Hotel. The main problem was the walls: they were so thin that you could virtually hear what the neighbors were wispering. And if you'll have so much bad luck as we had, i.e. having very noisy neighbors, it'd be even impossible to sleep. Next thing - keys. To get to your room you need 3 keys. It is good for security reasons but there was a constant problem with opening the doors, the keys were getting stuck all the time. And after several attempts to get them out it started to be quite frustrating. Another problem: bathroom. It was a shared bathroom (for 2 rooms) leaving aside a huge fungi on the ceiling, there was a patch of pubic hair on the tiles uncleaned for the entire time we've spent in that hotel!!! Last but not least, to get to the breakfast room, you had to go out on the street and go there using another entrance to the hotel. NOT pleasant in winter time. Forget about going to breakfast in your sleepers!

<Content>It was ok for the money Just returned from a weekend at the Abba. Easy access to and from Central Station (E1.80 single, tram stop No 1 just outside hotel.The hotel is ok, basic but clean with lots of stairs. The reception staff are very helpful. I was impressed with the security, different keys for access to stairs, corridors and rooms. Breakfast is standard continental, lots of it.If you dont want to eat/drink downtown, it only takes 3 minutes walk to get to Leidseplein, and about 10 minutes walk to the Van Gough museum.

<Content>Great Value Well situated and excellent for the tram as there is a tram stop outside the entrance to the hotel that goes directly to the train station. Also a late night convenience shop opposite as well which was useful for bottles of water and snacks. Friendly staff. Be prepared to carry your case up very steep  narrow stairs (I was on the top floor by the last day of my holiday I felt pretty healthy with all the exercise). The rooms are basic but clean and towels where changed everyday. I felt for the money (55 Euros a night for a twin room with private bathroom) the hotel was excellent.

<Content>Exceptional Staff You cannot find a better value than this hotel. I paid 35 euro a night for a single/shared bath. Steps from the Leidseplein area which has dozens of bars and restaurants. Tram stop is right in front of the hotel, though I reccomend a bike. The staff here is really nice and eager to help you find some great things to do. It is also a smoke friendly hotel.

<Content>Great value for your money! For a one star hotel Abba is excellent! Our room was clean and the staff was very friendly  helpful. This was exactly what my girlfriend and I were looking for. Even the location was better than we expected, half an hour walk to the train station, but only a few minutes from Leidse Plein and the best shopping areas. Only minuses came from the fire alarm accidentally going off one night (someone forgot to open the window while smoking weed;) and from the staff only giving us one fresh towel the second day (they fixed the mistake right away). Would definitely recommend Hotel Abba to all young Dam -visitors!

<Content>Good place to stay My Husband and I stayed at the Abba Hotel with two friends for 3 nights. I have to say I have not got one complaint, the hotel was quite near to the nightlife bars etc... but not in the centre of the City. The number one tram will take you from central station to the hotel and stops right outside the hotel so very handy, it would be approx. a 20min walk to Dam Square from the Hotel so it's really not that far out. The rooms were basic but very clean and comfortable. There is a supermarket below the hotel and a late shop just across the road which can be handy. I would stay in this hotel again.

<Content>A great place to stay for a week in Amsterdam We stayed 7 nights at Hotel Abba. For the price we payed, the hotel was more than we expected. Breakfast every morning was delicious - toast, meat, cheese, eggs, cereal, coffee, tea and orange juice. The staff was exteremely friendly and made our stay in Amsterdam very enjoyable.The location was fantastic - near Vondelpark and Museum Quarter. Close to the center of Amsterdam, but not in a loud neighborhood. Certainly not a 'ghetto' as another reviewer stated, simply a city neighborhood. We never saw any mice or mousetraps for that matter.Yes the stairs are steep, but they also were very steep in the other hotels we stayed in, in the Netherlands. One thing to watch out for - the television. We had trouble leaving in the morning because we would get sucked into European MTV - a dangerous endeavor.

<Content>Mouse trap under my bed!!!! - 0 stars I stayed at this disgusting hotel after reading the reviews on this website and this place is a nasty dump!!! I would only recommend it to my worst enemy!For starters walking up the dirty filthy steps to the reception area: I smelled urine!!!! C'mon!!! These folks don't even hose down their nasty steps on a regular basis.. One has to wonder if they change the sheets on a regular basis..Also the steps are sooo steep that I laughed when I saw them.. I couldn't believe that someone took the time to design and build such ridicules impractical steps.. The designer/ builder was obviously drunk, high, or incredibly mad with the hotel owner..Mouse trap..My hotel room didn't include soap; a face towel; and curtains for all the windows, but it did include a free mouse trap under my bed!!!The neighborhood surrounding hotel abba looks ghetto by US standards..Needless to say, I would NEVER EVER stay there again!!! And would give this hotel a big fat ZERO!Tammy..P.SI was lucky to get out of there alive!

<Content>Worth the price The staff was extremely helpful at Abba. As with every place in Amsterdam, we had to deal with steep curving stairs. We had to share a bathroom with the neighbors as well as the balcony. Interesting view into private apartments from the balcony. It was worth the price, due to location, cleanliness, breakfast, and amenities.

<Content>Worth the Price Stayed at the Hotel Abba in November of 2001. Good location outside of the city center yet close to museums and entertainment. Check out The Noon coffeeshop nearby. My single room was small but the bed was comfy and there was a TV with CNN in english. Staff was friendly and room was clean.

<Content>No frills but just what we wanted - "crackin'" Myself and a group of student mates stayed at the Abba in'dam back in January '02. Once we had negotiated the steep stairs with liquid running down them we were surprised to find a spacious room with are own private bathroom! The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, especially Flangelena Von Fanny Van Flange. Although breakfast was offered the four of us never quite managed to get up in time to sample the delights! Ideally situated and only a 2 minutes walk from a 24 hour photocopying facility!! Really useful for us students....? For what we paid we couldn't have asked for any more! We even wrote a song:Hotel Abba Budget Price (in the tune of Hotel California, by The Eagles)Living it up at the Hotel Abba Budget Price what a total disgrace, there's mice all over the place Living it up at the Hotel Abba Budget Price such a s*** place, you'll offend your mates...copyright mcgOnly kidding it's a great place!

<Content>Enjoyed my stay This hotel gives a great value for the small price that they charge. While their prices have gone up over the years, I've always found a welcoming staff, decent rooms, interesting fellow travelers and (and this is very important), excellent coffee.

<Content>Abba - no complaints We have stayed at the Abba twice and have had no complaints. It's great due to the fact that it is cheap, clean, breakfast is what you would expect for Amsterdam, on a main tram route and handy for everything. Anyone that complains shouldn't be staying in a budget hotel they should be digging deep and paying for what they actually want from a hotel.
