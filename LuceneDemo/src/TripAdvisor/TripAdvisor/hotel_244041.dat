<Content>A perfectly suitable budget motel. Our family of four (2 adults, 2 children) stayed at this Motel 6 for one night March 18, 2008 as we had an early flight to Disneyland the next morning. We just wanted a cheap, clean place to sleep as we were leaving at 6 a.m. The big bonus was that this motel offered free Park  Fly for the week we were away, just for staying the one night! We left our van parked right outside the motel office which is staffed 24 hrs/day so felt it was safe. The cost for the airport shuttle, which came immediately when we called, was only $8 total for our entire family. As far as the room goes, I had expected a nightmare but it turned out to be just fine: Simple, but clean. It had two queen beds, a TV and the bathroom was spotless. My only complaint would be that they didn't provide shampoo, only soap. No biggie. But, by far, the main reason we would recommend this motel is for the great deal on Park Fly and the cheap, convenient shuttle service. (By the way, the shuttle is provided by Extra Car which has their office right next to the motel--hence the quick pick-up. Their service was friendly and professional.) We would have no problem staying at this Motel 6 again.

<Content>Hated it We knew we would be only staying a few hours, just to catch some sleep before heading on the rest of our journey to see family. Our flight got in so late that we knew we would not need any fluff, just a good nights rest. We should have just kept going and not wasted our time and money. The motel was dirty, hairs in the beds, slobber stains on the pillow cases. It was just plain nasty. We asked for new pillow cases, which they did supply. That was better than nothing, but the stay was not enjoyable. It was also very noisy. We got to the hotel at about 1:30 AM and you would think it would have been quiet, not so! I wish we had not stayed but having got in so late they had already charged our credit card, so what do you do? Even losing our money would have been better that to have stayed there. Don't know if I will ever stay in another Motel 6 again.

<Content>You are better off sleeping in your car We spent 4 nights in the Seattle area and since we were flying out early in the morning, we thought we'd save money and stay at Motel 6 Seattle Airport. This was the biggest mistake we made. Our room was a health hazzard. There were blood stains in the bathroom and we found a drug syringe in the roll of the toilet paper. I complained to the hotel manager and she didn't even apologize. You're better off sleeping in your car.
