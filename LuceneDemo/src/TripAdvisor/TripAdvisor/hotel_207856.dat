<Content>Lovely Hotel, Great Location! We spent four nights in this peaceful, pleasant hotel, just my husband and I for a few days in Paris, without our kids. We had booked a deluxe room but when we arrived at the hotel, we enquired about upgrading to a suite. We were shown a lovely room on the top floor with a living room, large bedroom, and a bathroom with a jacuzzi/bubble bath, which we were offered at a reduced rate and we were keen to accept. The hotel was fairly modern in decor, the beds were comfy and everywhere was nicely cleaned and looked after. Our only criticism would be that the carpets were very dated and quite dirty and the wallpaper needed replacing.Breakfast was good, not the best we've had, but good, a reasonable choice and kept us going throughout the day. Patrick, the hotel concierge, was extremely helpful and went out of his way to chat to us and give us any information we needed. The location was good. We walked to the arc de triomphe easily and caught a sightseeing bus from nearby, which we used for two days to get around Paris. This was a very pleasant hotel and we would stay there again.

<Content>A great hotel... When looking in brochures for hotels in Paris the boutique style of La Villa Maillot instantly stood out and on arrival I wasn't disappointed. I had booked to stay for a long weekend with my family for my 18th birthday and the helpful and pleasant staff made sure that the holiday was one to remember. The lobby and breakfast areas are very attractive and the hotel is very conveniently located near shops, cafes and the metro. A fantastic stay!

<Content>An unexpected surprise We booked to stay in the Residence Foch for our weekend in Paris, after much research and taking the advice from the Tripadvisor reviews. The day before we were due to go, the hotel contacted us and because of problems with the water there, they had rebooked us to stay at La Villa Maillot. I was a bit disappointed, especially because Residence Foch was number 1 on the popularity index, and the Villa Maillot was number 364! However, we had a very good experience there. The rooms and the bed were a very generous size for a Paris hotel, there was a good sized very pleasant bathroom, bath robes etc etc. The helpful hotel staff recommended an absolutely excellent restaurant nearby (L'Auberge Dab)It is 10 mins from the Champs Elysee, 2 mins from a metro station, so in a good position to get to wherever you are going.If you want a good comfortable hotel, this is great, but the downside it that it is clearly a business hotel and is quite impersonal and doesn't have that Parisienne je ne sais quoi.... but having said that, we had a great couple of days there.

<Content>A gem of a boutique hotel We stayed 6 nights at this boutique hotel conveniently near L'Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower...the Metro was also very close by. The staff was wonderful and our room was exceptionally clean and elegant and fully equipped with flat-panel tv, mini-bar, hair dryer, robes, slippers and tea service. The buffet breakfast was lovely in the glass covered dining room and bar 143. Full service on an intimate scale. Overall, it was just lovely.

<Content>A touch of luxury We stayed at this hotel with our 11 year old son, who shared our room. If I have one negative comment about this hotel it would be that the room we were in was just a bit too small to accommodate a third bed. However, the room was otherwise great. It was really thickly carpeted and we heard no noise from other rooms which is really unusual. There was a plasma screen TV on the wall and a mini bar which we used to chill our own drinks! The bathroom was lovely - marble, great shower, loads of hot water for a deep bath, hairdryer, toiletries and towels changed twice a day. Toilet and bidet were screened off from the rest of the bathroom by a sliding door. There is a turndown service at night and they leave you a little card with the next day's weather forecast. The room had air-conditioning/heating which was great because it was freezing when we were there (October).Breakfast was buffet service, although if you weren't early, there sometimes wasn't much choice left. If you were lucky though, there was cereal, salmon, scrambled eggs, cold meats and cheeses, fruit and, best of all, pastries and croissants! The coffee is excellent and strong and our son loved the hot chocolate. They also happily do refills. The breakfast room is lovely - it's quite small with a glass covered roof and it looks onto a small garden. In fact the whole hotel is really beautifully presented and very clean. The decor throughout is modern and tasteful. We found all the staff really friendly although I don't know if it helped that I speak reasonable French. The whole atmosphere is very welcoming and cosy. It felt like a nice hotel the minute you stepped through the doors.Location wise, it's on a nice quiet street, near a Metro station and within walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe. There is a small supermarket across the road and an excellent Chinese restaurant next door which served the best tofu I've ever had anywhere.If you're going to Paris for any reason, this hotel is worth considering. We would definitely stay there again - we loved it!

<Content>I love La Villa Maillot They are very kind and helpful, and serves excellent breakfasts. Since the place is near conference center, the street in front of hotel is very quiet. Although it is not cheap very much, I think it's worth paying.

<Content>Boutique Magnifique One of the most memorable hotels in the world for its intimate charm. The staff gave us the Four Seasons treatment on each stay. All the best that Paris has to offer is within walking distance or use the subways or buses to reach those far off destinations. The rooms were spotless with all emenities that are necessary for a relaxed stay. The beautiful marble bathrooms contain not only the usual hair dryer but also a bidet and telephone.Recommended to all who enjoy luxury at an affordable price.
