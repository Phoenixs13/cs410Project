<Content>The views were great, the hotel was average. I stayed at this hotel in March 2007 as part of a college trip to Berlin. The name of the hotel is explained when you look out of the windows of the room, particulary if you were on the 9th floor as I was. The views from the hotel across the city are amazing. The rooms, however, are small and two single beds really means two single mattresses on the frame of a double bed, which led to poor sleep.The security of the hotel is good, as it is not possible to get into the hallways without an electrontic tag for that floor. The lifts are small, very slow and are the only way to move between floors as the stairs can only be used in case of a fire. The transport links are good, it is 10 minute walk from Charlottenburg S-Bahn station, and there is a bus station right outside the hotel, which has buses to Tegel airport. However, the location of the hotel is not great as the area contains a lot of strip clubs and sex shops which may offend some visitors. The staff are friendly and a number of them do speak English. The food at the hotel is average and the breakfast selection is uninspiring. Overall, this hotel is average, it's not the worst hotel in Berlin but it is not the best either.
