<Content>A bit disappointed Pros: well located, helpful staff, not outrageously priced.Cons: -- Rooms were tiny and cramped. The chair could not pull out completely from the table because it hit the bed. You have to almost crawl around the room it is so tight.-- Bathrooms smelled. The air vents for the water drainage system are in the floor so there is a constant, light scent of sewage. It is not overwhelming but it is unpleasant. Also, several times suds came up out of the floor vents when I was showering.-- Workout facility. The pool is great but the athletic room is a joke. It is tiny, has a few pieces of older equipment and should not qualify as a real athletic facility.

<Content>Great location in Berlin We stayed at the Kimpinski for three nights in mid September, 2008. The hotel rooms were nice, a bit old fashioned, but we found that charming. They were very clean and well maintained. Breakfast came with our room and it couldn't have been more delicious.The location is wonderful in the midst of the shopping boulevard. The pool and health spa area was excellent after a long day of sight seeing. We were able to do a lot of walking to points of interest from the hotel. If we go back to Berlin, we would choose to stay here again.H  P Friedman

<Content>Mixed feelings Well, we have some mixed feelings about it. We spent 3 days in thi hotel. Booked on a hotel website for a junior suite including breakfast. The hotel is 5 star but semed to be a little bit cheaper than some other 5 star hotels in the centre of Berlin. Stayed in Kempinski hotel in Dresden last year and absolutely loved it so we were looking forward to another lovely experience.The entrance and public rooms are great!!! The reception people were very friendly and the same can be said about the Concierge. We were told that we were going to have a bigger room than a junior suite and were pleased at first. Well, now this is the bad point about the whole stay. The room (229) was indeed very big with a separate room in addition to the bedroom, there were two bathrooms. But there was no DECOR to it whatsoever! It was so BORING! It was ORDINARY and nothing could remind you that it is indeed a 5 star hotel!! The wiring, the furniture, the heating system, the curtains, even the bed spread looked so cheap and dated!!! Not to mention ugly looking drains on the floors of both bathrooms!!! It was quite a strange feeling coming from a grand reception area into such a room!!!Breakfast was very good with lots of choice of food. We also had a very good dinner in the same restaurant.

<Content>Small rooms, No aircon/heating control, Overpriced, Great Location Stayed in Berlin end of Oct 2008, first time to city.Good points- The hotel is in a fantastic central location, close to shops, with easy transport links nearby access to rest of city.Staff, all very friendly, helpful, knowledgeableRooms clean, tidy all very presentableBad points- Rooms very crampt, even the deluxe/superior rooms. Air con just does not work, there is no way to control the temperature of the heating - its either on or off. (we had to sleep with the window open to maintain any sort of pleasant temperature at night!)Breakfast was hugely overpriced 25euros each! The starbucks opposite hotel, or any number of nearby cafes a much better option.Wifi was not free with room rates. At the price they charge, Id expect that to be free!Overall -The hotel is good, great location, but I dont think its really a 5* hotel. Its sells itself as the oldest grandest hotel in Berlin with a fantastic rich history, which it certainly cant be knocked. But as a modern 5* hotel, no. Would I recommend this to others? Unlikely. The hotel really needs to sort out the aircon/heating systems - a basic necessity of a 5* hotel

<Author>HonestJohnUk
<Content>A little disappointing for a 5 star I booked this for a 3 night stay, on my own. I opted for a deluxe superior room which was being offered for the same rate as a standard.My room, on the 4th floor overlooking Fasanen Strasse, was perfectly adequate, but as others have said not really up to 5 star rating. It was a warm (Berlin Marathon) weekend in late September, and the room was quite stuffy - the 'air cooler' switch did nothing but generate a trickle of air and some noise. Air conditioning it was not.The furniture and fixtures were a little tired and knocked about too. The bathroom was quite reasonable, but the sink plug plunge/lift mechanism was broken leading to a lot of fiddling around to fill and drain the sink. And the bathroom smelt quite 'drainy' too - there was a steel grid in the marble floor through which I could see some foul water - nice! Someone else has commented on this bathroom odour elsewhere in these KB reviews.Otherwise, pretty unremarkable really. I've stayed in loads of hotels in Berlin, and most were at least as good if not better despite lesser star ratings and cheaper prices. And I avoided the expensive breakfast - a coffee and a roll in a cafe in the Zoo S-Bahn or Europa Center is 4 Euros - and sufficed for me.

<Content>Thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Kempinski Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The hotel reception area is very impressive, the rooms are on the small size but very comfortable and the bed was big and extremely comfy. Good size bathroom. Staff were very professional. Breakfast was fantastic, served in a pretty mock- country kitchen arrangement, and you can sit in the hotel's cafe area to eat, overlooking the main street and watching the world go by. All kinds of breads, cakes, muesli, fruit, jams, hot buffet items, cheeses etc are available, and also excellent espresso coffee on request. Hotel is very well situated, close to the main shopping area, and buses and trains. Swimming pool is a good size (not crowded at 8.30am, people swimmming in well-behaved lines!) and sauna area is very pleasant, immaculately kept and run, but be aware that the showers are at the side of the pool not in the actual changing rooms. Bath robes are provided. Would certainly return for this hotel experience.

<Content>A great hotel I travel on a regular basis to Berlin on business and have just stayed three nights at the Kempinski Hotel Bristol .... I am very surprised at some of the comments I have read. Firstly the staff at receiption, the bar, and the pool area were simply fantastic. All etremely helpful, polite and very professional. The room was fresh, very clean, and although compact very well laid out and extremely comfortable. I had a truely wonderful stay. The hotel is well positioned on the Ku Dam, yet quiet and the food was simply terrefic. I have recommended that my company use this hotel in future it was a pleasure to be a guest at the Kempinski and I look forward to returning there in Qctober.

<Content>Great Location, rooms small. We stayed here for the weekend  certainly the location is great, just off the main shopping thoroughfare, Potsdamer Platz  very close to the train station  the Metro. The hotel is an old Art Deco property that has been rebranded by Kempinski, so with their refurb of the main lobby, many of the original featues have been lost. Breakfast  the food in general is good if not a tad pricey for the quality. The rooms however are small  the pics on the web have been cleverly taken to maximise the space, so be careful with the type of room that you book. The bathrooms are also small, but with very high quality giveaways, which is always good. Staff are very pleasant especially on the Concierge desk. We would recommend.Also in Berlin try Vapiano Italian Restaurant, very close by. Fab food  a great swipe card system.....Enjoy!

<Content>Luxury that needs an update - but with world class bartender We booked this hotel via a special offer on a Danish website (USD 350 per person for 2 nights including flight from Copenhagen). Having stayed at some great hotels in Berlin previously (Grand Hyatt at Potsdamer Platz and Louisa's Place on Kurf眉rstendamm), we expected quite a lot from Kempinski Bristol. Expectations we're only partially met.The staff was every bit as service minded as you could expect on a 5-star hotel, and the rooms, lobby etc. was spotless. We got two excellent restauranttips from the reception desk. The service was great, including room service.The rooms - which had an OK size including a quite large bathroom - were, however, a bit worn down and in dark colors. Not that the carpets etc. needed replacements, but the rooms in general just need to be shined up and taking into the 21st. Century. This also applies for the pool, which definetely needs to be given a refurbishment.But, but, but - the hotel bar (Bristol Bar) has one of the best bartenders in the world (Thomas), and he gave us a treat of some of the best drinks we ever had. He's worth the stay alone.All in all a defintely above average stay.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Reviewer: Deirdre Elliott, Dublin IrelandDate 27th February 2008Myself and my husband stayed in the Kempinski Hotel Berlin for three nights (from 18th February 2008 checking out on the 21st February 2008). I have to say this is a very lovely hotel. Yes rooms may be a bit small but very cozy and clean. The staff of this hotel from the chamber maids to reception staff were extremely polite, friendly and very helpful (always saying hello as you passed in and out) and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. I would recommend it to a friend and I would have no hesitation about staying at this hotel again. The location is brilliant near plenty of shops, restaurants and sightseeing busses are just across the street. I want to say a big thank you to the extremely friendly staff at this hotel who made our stay very special.

<Content>Rather disappointed Ideal location for our first trip to Berlin as it is near shops, an underground station, the main station and strolling areas but......rooms were very small (amongst the smallest I've ever seen) with the bed taking up most of the room so really no space to walk around at all, dated in appearance as if they needed a very overdue refurbishment and absolutely not the 5 star rating it was given. We have stayed in 5 star hotels and I'd give this 3 stars only. Staff OK but although we had a very late flight home, they would not even listen to any requests for a slightly extended check-out. I was dismissed with a wave of the hand. Can't comment on food as prices looked high so we eat elsewhere and there were good places for all meals close by.Really enjoyed Berlin but I would not stay in this hotel again because of the room size.

<Content>Tale of Two rooms Yes, the reviews of other guests are correct. This hotel is definately a mixed bag, all depending on the location of your room. The lobby area is nice, the breakfast buffet (if you get a rate where it is included) is one of the best in the city and the location at the Kudamm really is top-notch. Ah yes, but back to those rooms. We stayed at the Bristol a total of seven nights on two seperate occassions. The first room was terrible. Although we had booked a superior deluxe room, wall paper was torn, barely functioning heat and a window where the frame looked like it was rotting. The hotel offered to move us once they could not get the heat to work, and we promply accepted. What a difference a few hundred yards can make. The second room was bright, freshly renovated, and everything you could ask for. On our second stay - same story. First room assigned was sub prime and we immediately asked to move. The second room was great. My suggestion if you stay here: see your room before you check-in. Overall the hotel is a solid B+, it just depends where you get your room ....

<Content>smells like [--] To be honest i dont have words to express how i feel after wasting 210 euros in this hotel. first impression, the lobby.it is a small 50s decorated space with only two seats to rest.if it is freezing outside you have problem because the cold comes through the entrance and you can really fill the chill.Approaching the desk now the staff does not welcomes you at all (VERY APPROPRIATE for a 5 star hotel) they give you your keycard and the instractions how to go alone to your room.And here comes your biggest surprise. OUR ROOM. Was on the 5th floor and by the time the elevator door has opened a terrible smell[--] hit us.We thought that this would be only in the corridor but boy we were so wrong.Our room had the same horrible smell and espessially the toilet.The misfortune did not stop here.The decoration of the room was shoking, the firniture were 60 years old, some of them broken, and by the side of the window there were vitrines with scaring statues inside. We were so disappointed but we could not go anywhere else because these were the only 5* rooms that we found in the internet for these dates. So we started to joking about this with our friends(we were two couples) and late at night we went to sleep. Around 8 in the morning we wake up from the noise.So long my sweet sleep. We thought that the housekiping ladies had a fight and shouting to each other but after this continued for two hours and the other couple told us that the same thing happened to them(their room was far away from us) we realized that this was the staffs attitude problem and lack of respect.Around 10.30 i went down to the lobby to tell my beefs and ask for another room.But the girl in the reception was not polite at all and seemed not to understand me.At the end they gave us a new room same as the other but not so smelly on the 4th floor.  I must say thet there was a good thing about this hotel, the breakfast.Delicious with variety of products. Concluding this humid old hotel should not be pronounced a 5 star hotel.its a shame.

<Content>residential care home Every year we travel 2 times to Poland and have a stop in Berlin. Last time we stayed in Radisson SAS and Marriott, 2 wonderful hotels. On our way back last august we stayed in a 3 star hotel, Sorat(see review there) which was much better than Kempinski.We have a little baby so we need some room, but our room was so small that she could almost only sleep in the bathroom. We requested for a bigger room which we got (friendly service). The rooms however are very out of date. Maybe the people who stay there, average over 70 (I guess), like that. Breakfast was very poor, very little choice. The worst I have ever seen in a 5 star hotel and not comparable to Sorat mentioned before. Location is great but for the price/quality is absolutely far too high. We'll never stay there again.

<Content>OK but not 5 star Lobby and rooms were beautiful and clean (upgraded to deluxe)but breakfast was appalling for 5 star, confusing menu (despite speaking German) and not very helpful or friendly staff. They forgot our eggs which were overdone by the time we got them, coffee not included in deal which is standard in most hotel breakfasts and the jam pot I was given (just one pot, mind you) was half empty as already opened - overpriced and not what you expect from a 5* hotel. Bill included drinks from pool bar but we never went to the pool! The worst was when we collected our bags from the store room for the airport, they had 'lost' the camera bag with all the expensive equipment in it-the reception staff did not seem bothered at all and if it weren't for the porter who checked another guest's room in case of a mix up, we would not have found our bag. No-one took responsibility or seemed at all concerned. I overheard another couple complaining about their room and, again, the reception staff did not seem bothered. Nice decor but not up to 5 star service or standard at all. Staff need customer service training and someone to take responsibility. No wonder we got such a cheap deal!

<Content>Ok Place to Stay in Berlin! The Kempinski Hotel is surely an ok stay in Berlin, however I am sure there are better stays for less money! Let's just say this place is a bit overpriced and snobby. The front desk staff were very helpful and accomodating! The restaurant staff were really snobby and rude at times. I was expecting better from the kempinski, the hotel room was a bit dated and looked worn, however the room was a good size. The bathroom was ok, but not the cleanest. The hotel claims to have air conditioning...do not be fooled...it is fully controlled by the hotel and it turned on very very low if even on at all! We had to ask for fresh towels daily and had to get a fan as the room was really very hot. Overall it was an ok stay.

<Content>if you like to be disappointed! I stayed Istanbul Kempinski hotel and it was marvellous gorgeous andthats why I didnt care about the bad reviews. Unfortunately they wereright! We got a suite looking at the backyard of the hotel where pipes and gas etc were. Room was very spacious but 50 years ago maybe it was luxurious! Old window frames, carpet, bed, bed covers, cassette player (!) old eveything...The bathroom welcomed us with a lot of stink from the old pipes. When I tried to open the windows then old and dirty curtains amazed me this time! IThis hotel doesnt deserve 5 star at all. Maybe 2 or 3 I would give. It is such a shame for Kempinski chains..It needs complete renovation from top to toe.The location was great for shopping but definitely not good for historic sites cause they are miles away. We didnt eat or drink at the hotel because we just hated to be there. Never again!

<Content>Faded Glory Stayed here on business for 8 days recently. As the other reviewers noted the lobby is beautiful but the rooms are shabby. What irritated me most is the fact that the rooms don't have any noticeable airconditioning. There is just a switch that you can flip that says airconditioning but no individually adjustable temperature. In my room there was no noticeable difference between leaving airco off and turning it on. As the whole week was very warm (temps up to 31 degrees C) sleeping was virtually impossible. Also the beds were very hard and uncomfortable. Upon inquiring at the front desk the person there acknowledged the problem and said he could not do anything about it. I will not stay here again as there are many very good and cheaper alternatives in Berlin. Think twice before spending your money here.

<Content>Not Grand Any More The hotel lobby is beautiful, and when you arrive, the check in is fast and nice. Then they escort to your room and surprise! The room is tiny and shabby. The room has rundown carpets, broken window frames, ugly and dirty bathroom. Actually the bathroom is uncomfortable and very badly designed. The furniture is old, and the beds have a dust odor. Breakfast is okay in quality and variety but service is not good. The only five star thing the hotel have is the price.

<Content>So Hot! We found the staff here very helpful and polite and overall we had a great time, however we stayed in a standard room which did actually have air conditioning but it was very old fashioned and really was useless, therefore the room was always absolutely boiling and even though temperatures outside were 5-6 degrees the hotel room was so hot we had to have the window open at all times. We could not close the curtains because the room was airless if we did. All in all though it was a good hotel.

<Content>The Kempi IS Berlin Stayed again at the Kempi - this time (our 6th) with a small group of friends; we all booked deluxe rooms and all of us were very happy indeed. We ended up with a Junior Suite with two bathrooms (just a bit of heaven). The new Reinhardt's restaurant on the Ecke now does the breakfast - and was well up to the Kempinski standard of having the best breakfast in town.The front desk and lobby lounge staff are truly quite remarkable for their friendliness and knowledge.Never hesitate to book the Kempi - we haven't since 1996.

<Content>Bristol - Faded Lady The Bristol Kempinsky USED to be a wonderful hotel. I have stayed here many times in years past. When this was the American Sector this hotel was alive with luxury and glamour. This time it was sad to see how far this hotel has fallen. I was shocked to see it's obvious decline from a top hotel to where it is now. It looks like they might be getting ready to close it. Nothing appeared to be maintained. The carpeting in the halls was threadbare in places! The walls were seriously banged up and marred and in need of painting. The rooms were very worn and in budget condition. What kind of message are they sending when this is how the areas are kept?Where once this was a lively and beautiful luxury hotel, it is now just depressing. Very sad.

<Content>Luxury hotel - lots of positives, one negative We booked a Junior Deluxe Suite for three nights at the end of December, going in to the new year. The idea was to have a romantic getaway after the bustle of Christmas, and this is exactly what we got in this hotel. I was a bit worried having read some of the begative reviews, but fortunately without cause, once we were there. Flew in to Tegel, and from there it was a 鈧?3 taxi ride - save yourself a few Euros going through the city, rather than via the motorway. Room service was great, and the turn down service immaculate - a weather forecast for the following day, a mat with slippers laid by your bed. Breakfast was very good as well. I would suggest taking breakfast in the cafe/restaurant (Russell's?) instead of in the Gartensaal. Its just a lot nicer (Gartensaal is quite functional) and has small tables.One negative was the pool area, where the service was more like in a boarding school than in a hotel, never mind a 5* one. I did complain to the reception manager, and the next day's treatment in the pool area was much more friendly. I would certainly stay in this hotel again, and would probably again splash out a little to make sure I got the same kind of (enormous) room / suite.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, fantastic break This was a beautiful hotel in the best location - perfect for sight seeing and shopping. We did the hop on hop off bus tour which was brilliant, plenty of freedom to see the city.The Christmas markets were famnastic, beautiful food, drink and atmosphere.The Kempinski was a brilliant hotel, staff were very friendly they rroms in my opinion were of a good standard too, the beds were very big and comfy, although a little warm.The pool was lovely very relaxing after a tiring day walking round the city, didn't try the breakfast as we went to the Christmas markets and ate there.Drinks in the hotel were as you would expect a little pricey but the do a fab latte macciatto!! If you go definately do the afternoon tea, great value for soming very special, as a Travel Agent i have staying in a few good hotels and this was by far one of the best.Berlin is the most amazing city, very safe, clean and plenty to do.You'll love it!!

<Content>50-50 We visited this hotel for a 4-day, 3 night Christmas Markets break at the beginning of December.Having got a good deal on Expedia (拢266 for three nights room only), we were not expecting huge luxury and boy, for the first night we did not get it either!Our room was tidy and clean and on the first floor. We later discovered it was directly above the 'Bristol Bar' and that there was a private function that evening.The music was so loud in our room that glasses on the bedside table were vibrating and you could actually hear the words of each of the (cheesy) songs. It took 4 calls to reception to speak to a manager and, as the hotel was full, we could not be offered a different room. As it was so bad, the manager sent out for earplugs for us, which arrived an hour later (around 1.30am) and the music stopped around 2.30am.So far, so poor.However, as guests were checking out on the following day, the hotel did move us to a much nicer room higher up in the building for our remaining two nights, which was very pleasant. A complimentary bottle of champagne also eased the trauma of the first night.So overall null points for the first night and probably 4 for the last two.The hotel generally is in a great location and has a super pool and spa for relaxing after those long days around town.The service is unexceptional (slightly uninterested, but you get what you ordered.....eventually) and all of the public bars and restaurants are smoking areas.The Grill Restaurant is an enjoyable 80s throwback experience and I noticed that many of its dishes also appeared on the other Kempi restaurant's menu at about E10 less...The buffet breakfast is delish, but not great value unless you eat your main meal first thing. Head round the corner to the Uhlandstr Rosti cafe for breakfast and fantastic fresh coffee.You should assume you won't be able to get the English language Film channel at busy times of the year as this has extremely limited availability.I strongly recommend refusing any rooms on the ground floor and paying a little more to avoid their lowest class rooms. If you can do that - this hotel is definitely a great choice.I would go back because of: the pool and spa, the location.

<Content>Christmas Shopping Stayed at the Kempinski in Nov 06. Its pretty much as described by other reviewers. Great location, helpful staff, plush 5 star lobby, very very expensive bar with terrible night club singer (quite fun) and nice spa/pool. (Rooms are more 2-3 star rather than 5) Had a problem with drains smelling v badly in room. Room was big (paid for larger one) but very dated. Brown wall paper and style of paintings depressing rather than evocative of faded grandeur......matched drains. All in all had a very nice time in Berlin and at Kempinski. Was not in room enough to complain about smell although use of bathroom etc for showering not pleasant. Spa much as described by other reviewers. Had a great massage there!Dont visit this part of Berlin without a visit to Ka de Wa the big dept store and its amazing food hall- great fun for sitting on a bar stool with feet dangling and good glass of wine. You can snack on anything from oysters, pasta, fish, anti pasta, chocolate, sausages etc etc.....and really watch the world go by! We sat down at 5pm just to rest our feet for half an hour and were still there at 8pm with no sign of store closing. Great bar next floor up aswell that we never knew existed until we were leaving. Hotel handy for open top bus etc which was great way to get around when only had 2 nights. Jewish museum very moving and excellent. Turkish quarter great night out. All in all I would return to Berlin but would definately try another hotel. Popped in by chance to the other kempinski in East Berlin and that looked so much nicer. That said what the Kempinski lacks in nice rooms (they have had their day!!) it makes up for in room price, service, experience, location location location and spa. If you have booked already I am sure you will have a good time. Got train (Airport Express) there from Schonweld which was ok but very long wait on a Saturday as not very frequent.Taxi back to airport from hotel was 35 euros and only took 25 mins but not at rush hour.

<Content>Not for light sleepers In many ways the Kempinski is a fine hotel. Location excellent, public rooms impressive, staff friendly and courteous. breakfast first class with the advantage of being available from 6.30 am which was handy for us as we had a 7.30 am departure.On the downside, the furniture in the (smallish) bedroom was a bit dated and tatty. Despite the fact that we had the heating turned off it was still warm and stuffy in the room which necessitated opening the window. This was ok during the day but at night the noise of the frequent trains from the nearby railway made a good night's sleep difficult. Also be careful in the shower as the bath was particularly slippery when wet as there are no ridges or strips or a rubber mat with which to grip your feet.

<Content>Perfect location, charming attentive staff. Wonderful location right on Oliverplatz and close to Zoo station. The hotel lobby is pretty impressive, staff are friendly and polite. Service with a smile! The rooms are a good size, clean and pretty luxurious. There wasn't alot of English speaking channels on the tv though. I tried out the 'Bed Menu' option which allows you to choose bed linen and pillows from a wide selection. The pool and spa are worth visiting and there's a little reasonably priced juice bar for smoothies, juices and coffee down there. I didn't have breakfast during my stay but I did have afternoon tea one day and it was well worth the Euro13.00.The plus points for this 5* joint is the location and the relaxed yet attentive charming staff. Well worth paying the extra bucks for this little bit of luxury.

<Content>Rthe place to be I visited this hotel many times in my working life enjoying the breakfast and the pool. Now private with my wife last septemberi we enjoyed it again!Booking far in advance for one of the specialprices on one of the hotelwebs you get a bang for your buck for 120 euro's per night in this hotel for ..... location, international atmosphere and pool. Take a breakfast somewhere else, but the new restaurant with the rerrace upstairs is ok!Just opposite in the Fassanenstrasse and around Fassanenplatz you find a lot of nice good italian and german restaurants. Shopping theater and U-bahn around the corner. Till next time again!

<Content>Not as amazing as we'd hoped, but okay We found the hotel on a lastminute.com special, and booked it based on reviews. Typically we stay in hostels so we expected a bit more luxury than usual - we were a bit disappointed.The rooms were clean and an average size for a major European capital. The decor looked a bit out of date, and the room felt 'tired'. It looked as if it could do with a bit of a revamp.There was no kettle (!) and the room was heated to within an inch of our lives (we stayed in late Oct, it was 'coat - cold' outside, but not yet 'glove and hat cold'). We couldn't find a way to switch this off so we had to suffer through it.Having said all that, the location is amazing. Perfect for exploring West Berlin and close to a major station (Zoological Gdns) so really, couldn't ask for more. There is nothing wrong with the place, it was perfectly pleasant - it just didn't match our expectations of four star luxury. If we got the same special again, we wouldn't hesitate to book it - knowing that we'd expect 'Holiday Inn' (minus the kettle) rather than 4 star luxury.

<Content>A Good Hotel But Beware! My wife and I enjoyed our stay although the room was on the small side but well appointed, beds very comfortable.The Bristol bar had live music of a fairly high quality on each night throughout our stay, going on untill 01:30 each night.The staff were smart curtious and professional at all times.So why beware. The excellent leisure centre,if you wish to use the part with the sauna and steam room, are obligatory mixed sex nude bathing, this may come as a surprise to some, particularly if you have a family with you. You only find out this once you have entered as there is no notice on the outside of the entrance door.That said this hotel still provides excellent service at a reasonable price.

<Content>The bathrobes rock I went here with my boyfriend and had a fantastic time. The staff were all really helpful, and didn't appear that embarrassed that we appeared in the lobby with your bathrobes and flip flops on. The concierge recommended a fantastic German restaurant for us for my boyfriend's birthday and as the hotel is near the equivalent of Sloane Square, there were quite a few places to find some bars.The pool and sauna are definite hightlights, but the pool attendants are VERY strict on the 'no bathers' policy, but that just made it highly entertaining.The room was maybe a little small, but the robes were great, and I can definitely recommend breakfast in bed!

<Content>Traditional hospitality, but a bit tired Stayed here earlier this month for a 2 day conference. I would imagine 20-30 years ago this was one of the best hotels in Berlin. Public areas are very grand and the service in all areas really could not be faulted. I came without my european power adaptor and within 5 minutes of requesting one from reception, it arrived.The rooms, whilst enjoying all modern facilites including Wifi, are very traditionally decorated and quite small with low ceilings giving a bit of a claustrophobic feel.The hotel seemed to have a large number of elderly upmarket groups staying  I imagine they loved the traiditonal aspects of the hotel. Last year I stayed at the Marriott which was more to my taste.

<Content>EXCELLENT HOTEL, FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL STAFF - expensive breakfast! Excellently located in the heart of one of Berlin's nicest shopping areas. Several tours begin within a couple of blocks of the hotel and it is only a short distance to many restaurants and bars etc. The Zoo is also close by and the Zoological Garden Station is only a few minutes walk away. Stayed in a superior deluxe twin room. Plenty of space. Two single beds, with several feet between then. Individual bedside tables, a desk, two armchairs, two wooden chairs etc. The overall standard of the hotel is excellent. Staff are exceptionally helpful and fluent in English. Checking in and out is fuss-free.Both the Kempinski Grill and Le Restaurant are of excellent standard with fabulous gourmet food.They are not cheap choices, but you certainly get value for money.HOWEVER two words to the wise: Bag took longer than would have liked to arrive at the room (around half an hour). If you are anxious to go out and explore I would suggest you take up your own. Also breakfast does not come included in the price of the room and, although there is plenty of choice from meats and fish, to breads and pastries, fruit, yoghurts and muesli, and even freshly-squeezed orange juice, it is very pricey. It is hard for even the heartiest appetites to eat 23 Euros worth of breakfast! There are several lovely cafes just around the corner on Kurfurstendamm which serve breakfast at a more realistic price.

<Content>Nice, but not superb I have stayed in quite a few four-five star hotels, and while this one qualifies, I would say there is nothing spectacular about it. The location is very good if you want to stay mostly on the Kurfurstendam. It is very convenient to the hop-on-hop-off bus tours. The room was nice, but the wear and tear of the years is showing. Be warned, although the room has air conditioning, it will never get colder than 76. For some that might be fine, but it is too warm a temperature for sleeping under the down duvets that are provided (no top sheet means sleep under the duvet or with no covers at all). Our phone was locked and we tried over and over to use it. My husband finally went downstairs to notify someone, and they came to fix it almost immediately. The staff was very nice, and the room service breakfast we ordered came quickly and was good. We most likely would not stay there again because for the price, you can find other hotels in Berlin that are probably a bit more luxurious and unique. The air conditioning situation alone would deter me unless it were winter. However, this hotel is definitely acceptable and worthy of four stars.

<Content>Enjoyed the Kempi After 5 years of being away from Berlin as a business traveler, my wife and I decided to go as tourists for a week at the end of March. Far greater value for money compared to London hotels and the room was spacious and all elements were in good repair: bath, bed, furniture, carpets, etc. Staff was very helpful in finding out of the way restaurants. Business center was also great for staying in touch via email, although the Easy Internet cafe across the street had a Dunkin Donut shop on the ground floor. Definitely recommend the multi-day travel pass as you can't beat the U-bahn or S-bahn or the bus system. Main restaurant on the corner was being converted into high end shops, but as we tend to eat out, that wasn't a negative for us. I've stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Potsdammer Platz which is far more sleek and chic. The Kempi is comfortable in a traditional way.

<Content>Great hotel in a perfect location I stayed at the Kempinski Hotel with my girlfriend and we had a fantastic time. The staff were very helpfull and friendly. The pool was a great way to relax after a day of shopping and sight seeing. The room was very clean and spacious but the air conditioning didn't work that well, so it was very hot in the room at night. The ku'damm is a brilliant street filled with shops, cafes, restaurants and bars with beer gardens. The europa center on the ku'damm is a cool place to hang out, with many street performers and friendly surroundings. Also berlin zoo is 5 minutes away and worth a trip too. The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is the breakfast. It's very expensive and you don't get much for that price. We had a great holiday in berlin and in the kempinski hotel and we would definitely come back here again.

<Content>The last uncool hotel in Berlin? This hotel is very conveniently situated. There is a bus stop a few metres away on the Ku'dam. The Zoo centre for all transport is two stops away, close enough to walk. The staff were without exception helpful and friendly. The room we had was surpisingly small for a 5* hotel. We suffered from the drains smell in the bathroom mentioned in the reviews. It disappeared after a shower of rain. The one thing that would make me choose another hotel is the lack of proper air-conditioning. We were there in early May and found the room too warm. The only thing we were offered was the use of a large fan! I hate to think what it would be like in high summer.Tip: When visiting Berlin buy a City-Pass (24, 48 or 72 hours) It covers every type of transport and is great value. It even gets you reductions into some places. Can be bought at the bus station or at some street kiosks.

<Content>Middle of the road The plus points - in a great location. Near to Zoo, which is great for transport to the rest of the city. On the main shopping street and close to some good restaurants around Sevigny.As for the hotel - rooms were clean, swimming pool is great and beds were comfortable. We got it at a great price and as we were there as tourists and really did not spend that much time in the hotel so if that's your plan then it's a good place.It is not worth spending big bucks on though - I would certainly not put it in the plush or deluxe category, more 'comfortable tourist'. The lobby is quite elegant, but the bedrooms are small and furnished in cheap looking wooden furniture. The soft furnishings did seem clean, but quite dated and not luxurious at all. The bathroom was standard, again no touches of luxury there i.e. no body lotion, no toothbrush, but there were robes.They are also doing building works on one side of the hotel - we weren't that disturbed by them, but there was definitely drilling going on late morning/early afternoons so do check where your room will be.

<Content>Stayed in January 2006 Just back from The Kempinski Bristol and can't understand some remarks about the location being poor. Location: Turn right out the door and your on one of the best shopping streets in Europe -Kurf眉rstendamn. High end shops all the way to bargain stores and plenty of restaurants. Facilities:We got a great deal on a junior suite for 鈧?99, well worth it. Room was big with a great walk in closet, nice bathroom and large dining table as well as coffee table with couches. They offer 6 different types of bedding and are only too happy to accomodate with these requests, or any others at all. Leisure: My fiance took advantage of a massage and found it excellent. The pool area is very relaxing with a bar. The hotel also offers a salon and sauna - al fresco! Food/Drink: Large selection at the breakfast buffet, but the hot food was luke warm at best. The formal restaurant looked very nice but we really aren't into the artsy menu. A fillet steak was 鈧?4 which I seldom will pay and didn't. The hotel lounge was large, comfortable and great for champagne by the fire or afternoon tea. The hotel has the Bristol bar located at the back of the lounge but if you didn't wear a dark pinstripe suit and had celebrated at least 65 birthdays, you got looks! Staff: All staff was top-notch, extremely helpful. Overall: Having stayed in various 5 star hotels, I would highly recommend this hotel and I would not be one to do so without good reason. However, as far as 5 stars go this is at the low end. The good thing is the only people that will notice this difference are those hotel snobs who bring a briefcase on holiday.

<Content>Non smoking rooms!!! We checked in at Dec. 29 and out at Jan. 3.It was a group reservation part of the offered program and were told that is was a five star Hotel. Well, five stars maybe not, but it's close to four. Rooms were clean but not big, personel is very willing to help and well trained. Breakfast is plentiful but needs a special touch to be satisfying. We placed at the first floor at the 147 no which was a smoking room, without being asked when checking in. Therefore smoke was penetrating from the connecting door from the next room, which was completing annoying especially at the night sleep. The reception suggested moving to a non smoking room, but this was quite an ordeal when you have already place your stuff around. So we suffered the torture with a promise to our selves to be more cautious next time. Germany is a heavy smoking country.

<Content>Good hotel, great location We stayed at the Kempinski purely by chance when we booked a secret hotel deal on Lastminute.Having read a number of bad reports about this hotel, I wasn't expecting too much however I was pleasantly surprised. Even though our rooms were small, they were clean and tidy and apart from having been allocated a smoking instead of non-smoking room (which resulted in a room change) I had no complaints.The pool area was very good but be aware that costumes are not allowed in the sauna and steam room (we decided to take the plunge and go native anyway!!).Located just off the Ku'damm the Kempinski was ideally placed for shopping. The U-Bahn just meters from the hotel provided easy access to the rest of the city.I would happily recommend the hotel if you are able to get a cheap internet deal.

We paid 52 Sterling per night  got the added bonus of being put in one of the superior rooms. Normally, we pay about gbp 70 / eur 100 a night and end up in 4-star places - we both felt the Kempi was a cut above what we are used to.The room was huge - there was a double bed, 2 armchairs, a desk, some cupboards and drawers yet you still had plenty of floor space to move around in. The bathroom was also very big - eg. 2 sinks -  immaculately clean -  We really loved the bathrobes. The only thing missing from the room was an iron (as usual!). The pool was nice, although a little small for doing lengths in  there were plenty of loungers where you could lie and order drinks. Any staff we dealt with were helpful  friendly.Location - Much as we loved this hotel, if we come back to Berlin, we will try and stay on the East side in a livelier district closer to the main sights. That said, public transport in Berlin is superb, so the location was never really an issue as you can get everywhere very easily. It's not a bad area to be in - just that you'll probably find you spend most of your time on the other side of town.Overall -I'd recommend the Kempinski without hesitation, especially if the price is right.

<Content>Great location  LOCATION:Hotel is in a great location on the Ku'Dam (West Berlin: tree lined shopping boulevard) and near Zoo Station. Savignyplatz is nearby also with a great choice in bars/restaurants (see Berlin Gal's postings which were great reference). However most of main Berlin attractions are in the east side of the city so you will find you will be using the S/U Bahn alot to get to them from the hotel. But to be honest, with the great public transit, this isn't much of an inconvenience. ROOM:Hotel room standard was excellent; not 5 star but a good 4 star level. However we did one incident: a change of room as there was a foul smell from the bathroom. Reception changed the room without hesitation and the new room was smell free! In fairness, walking around the city later there seemed to be the same drain smell in certain locations. VALUE:Great inet deals for the hotel. Would return to hotel and will be definitely returning to Berlin (lots still to see and do). The Christmas markets and atmosphere was great.

<Content>Superb Location Stayed at the kempi earlier this week. Their is quite a bit of renovations going on at this hotel at the moment however this should not put people off. The hotel has a lot of character and is situated in a great location with many bars and restaurants nearby as well as the underground which is minutes away. We had booked via lastminute and to be fair I was expecting a room of should we say a lesser standard. I couldnt have been more susprised as we were allocated a great room. The pool is very good and was nice to use at the end of a days sightseeing, although prudish guests should note that swimwear is not allowed in the steam and sauna rooms! I went in but quickly turned around!! All in all very pleased with the hotel and would recommend it to any future guests.

<Content>Good Hotel, Great Location We found the rooms and service in the Bristol to of a good standard, not quite 5 star though. The pool is a welcome bonus after a hard days sight seeing. If you can get a room for about 拢80, as we did, it represents exceptional value. In my opinion it is hard to beat the location of this hotel in the heart of the main shopping street in West Berlin, with the excellent public transport system close by, you can get anywhere in the city quickly.If you don't wish to travel too far for your evening out, there are some good reasonably priced bars and restaurants down most of the side streets off the Kurfurstendamm.

Room had been recently refurbished and everything had been thought of. Reception were very keen to recommend restaurants and were friendly. Swimmimg pool was very clean and a nice get away. Perfect location just minutes from the shops and major sights.

<Content>Very Nice but Very Uppity At the time I was in Berlin, I was working for a very large internet hotel booking company and advised the staff I would be visiting and doing a Spot Check for my company. Over the phone they were delightful and seemed to be eagerly awaiting my arrival. The hotel was beautiful, the rooms were small but still extreamly well furnished and upscale. the coincerge was more then helpful finding me tickets and getting me just about everything I needed. I was disappointed in the front desk as they looked right over me several times to talk amoungst themselves. (quite a suprise considering I was from a company that sells their rooms for them) All and all it was beautiful and the location was amazing. Not quite the 5 star calibur I've stayed at before. For the money I would stay at the other Kempinski though. Still beautiful.

<Content>Great location, but a bit of a disappointment I spent 5 nights at the hotel at the end of September this year. I had found a 'top secret luxury hotel deal on a 'Lastminute' site and had only paid 拢62.50 per night which was fabulous value. However I was expecting a top quality 5 star hotel. The Kempinski is nice but hasn't got the edge. My partner and I both said that it was possibly the equivalent of a 4 star in the UK. However the clientele obviously still treat this hotel as a 5 star - when you return to your room after a long day with a coffee and doughnuts for supper, you receive very disapproving looks from othe residents in the elevator!My partner went for a massage in the 'fitness area' which was really impressive. The swimming pool is very cold so be aware.It's in a great location, across the road from the underground and is surrounded by shops and restaurants.However if you go to Berlin you must visit Cafe Adler, across the road from Checkpoint Charlie. Its very famous a great tourist attraction, and the food is great and inexpensive.

<Content>Poor quality rooms Stopped in the Bristol Kempinski in Berlin during June and would have to say I was very dissappointed with the size and standard of the room we were allocated. The room was very basic and small and in need of refurbishment to breathe some life back into it. The air conditioning was none existent even though it was very hot outside and the fact that we could not shut the curtains meant that we were awake early every morning as soon as the sun rose, (could have had something to do with the amount of alcohol consumed though). The bathroom whilst clean was pretty drab.On a positive note the location of the hotel is great being on the Ku'damm and close to Zoo Station, and the communal areas of the hotel did exude class.If I go to Berlin again I would probably try to stop in the more modern Swissotel which is in an equally as good location but looks alot more modern.

<Content>Kempinski Bristol in Berlin lied about their accommodations. We were there on hot days in June. They told us, upon checking in, that the hotel was not airconditioned and gave us a loud fan instead. We stayed five nights and discovered that they lied -- they do have air conditioned rooms. They finally gave us one free night.We feel that they lied and misrepresented the hotel.I would never stay here again, obviously.

<Content>A hotel that has seen better days I can only echo some of the comments from fellow travellers. I too had high expectations, but those expectations had been met by the Westin Grand Berlin and in the Steigenberger, so why not here?I too suspect that unlike the other two hotels I mentioned, that the Kempinski gives those who order rooms via Expedia their ugly ducklings. Our room was not only dated, but also dirty, I felt like I was in a bad version of the pensions I was relegated to during my student years.The lobby is impressive, but that only made the dingy room seem even worse. I felt like I was in the slum area of the hotel and a high quality hotel should not have any such rooms.The spa area is nice, but nothing special. The Westin Grand and Steigenberger are far better in this regard (and all other regards too). I agree that the street cafe is great spot to sit and watch the world go by, but I would suggest that you stay at another hotel and then walk over to the Kempinski cafe, which is a far more comfortable place than the room I had.I cannot recommend this hotel, and I would not stay here again. Berlin is a city full of outstanding hotels, and my experience here has led me to conclude (with all due respect to the Kempinski name), that this hotel has seen better days.

<Content>Disappointed My wife and I stayed here for two nights in April and we were very disappointed in our room. I do not understand how this place rates five stars. While the location was great for shopping and the public areas were nice, the room was cramped, pitiful, and worn. We also stayed at the Westin Grand (East Berlin) and at the Swissotel in this same area and we were much more pleased with both of these properties.

<Content>great stay we spent three lovely nights here last weekend.the staff was helpful and friendly . i LOVE their beds and pillows. Not accustomed to this level luxury. got super interent rate and couldn't resist.I do agree with a previous poster that the hallways were a bit dated, but our room was very comfortable and must have been updated. The small size of hotel was enjoyable, and the location cannot be beat. Many reknown restaurants in neighborhood, along with internet caf茅s, shopping, transport and metro at the door. Three Musketeers Musical two blocks away. Would return if I get good rate again.

<Content>Past its peak I used to walk past this hotel many times as a teenager, wondering what it would be like, staying the night in a hotel where one night would have blown my weekly budget. Then, in the cold war years, I thought of it as one of the absolute top hotels in town. I was disappointed when I finally stayed there as a guest. The first impression was quite what I expected, though I did not appreciate being told off by a doorman about smoking outside the hotel, and throwing a cigarette end on the pavement. Reception was as polite and professional as expected, though I found the room tired and in need of refurbishment.As I took up an offer, paying about what you would expect for a mainstream 4*, I found the value for money OK. Would go again just for the location, but thinking of the hotel as on a par with the usual chains.

<Content>Comfortable I have just had a long weekend here. The location is perfect. A 2 minute walk on the main street brings you to where all the city tour buses depart. This is in my view the most beautiful part of Berlin since there are some original buildings in tact. And it's close to all the main shops and the main department store. The hotel is large. There is an excellent buffet breakfast with everything anyone could want - and good quality too.The health club is lovely with a very big pool and saunas. The restaurant at night served us an excellent meal. At night the Kempinski's street cafe is busy and you can watch the world go by - quite Parisien.The bar is relaxing and subdued at night. But be warned, if you are a male traveller there is a chance you will be approached in the bar by ladies of the night! I saw one go off with an English guy up to his room. An hour later she was back. She kept smiling at me and after a while it was funny because the poor woman didn't guess I was gay! She was there every night, and the bar man gave her free drinks! Apparently the Kempinski is 'famous' for this. But she was an upmarket femme fatale, not some street tart. So at least she blended in! The hotel is very inobtrusive and doesn't blink an eye at guests' comings and goings - much like the whole of Berlin.The room was large with a large bathroom. But it did feel cold in that it had no personality, and absolutely no view. Just a large functional but comfortable base. In my view 4 stars not 5.But the location, excellent staff - Berliners really are very friendly and put us Londoners to shame, - and the space in the hotel (no one is on top of you, except the young lady in the bar!). So overall the public areas felt classy and spacious.Also I thought the hotel was very clean. The health club was spotless.We got an excellent deal on Expedia - we paid far less than for a similar hotel in London or Paris.So if you want a good, comfortable, central base with all amenities, then I could not fault the kempinski. And Berlin was fantastic - one of my favourite cities in the world now.But a tip: on Sundays Berlin closes down completely due to religious laws. So it was a wasted day for us - our flight swere Monday morning. We searched high and low for a cafe that was open to no avail. All shops are closed too. So for us Londoners who are used to Sundays being like Saturdays it came as a shock. A few gay bars were open but they were dead. Berliners apparently stay at home on Sundays. So if you're going for a weekend don't waste your money staying Sunday, arrive on a Thursday and leave first thing Sunday morning.

<Content>Dated I spent four nights here last week with my wife. All the communal areas were what you would expect and the pool was lovely. However, we couldn't help but feel that as we'd got a cheap rate from Expedia they tried to give us the most basic room that they could. The room was rather cold and the bathroom dated. My main complaint was that there was a door in the room that connected us with the next room (it was locked), when the guest in that room came in at one in the morning the non-existent sound proofing meant that he might as well as got into bed with us. Not what I expect from a 5 star hotel.

<Content>Confortable stay Last summer I stayed at this hotel for a week with my family. I had a great time there. Firstly, almost all staffs were friendly and kind. (except one bellboy.) I stayed at junior sweet room. It was big and it had two powder rooms. Amasing!I had breakfast in a buffet restaurant everyday. There were so many kinds of bread, cheese, ham, fruits, salad. I was not bored to choose my breakfast everyday.I use a massage salon, a female staff was kind. Her skill of massage was wonderful.

<Content>Pampered perfectly! Great Hotel We arrived at the hotel mid afternoon on Boxing Day and were immediately greeted at the door by a lovely young girl who spoke very good English and took our bags straight to our room. The room was lovely, great kingsize bed with individual cotton-covered duvets and choices of pillows - nice fluffy bathrobes and slippers!The spa is fantastic with steam room, sauna and swimming pool.Waiter service brought us drinks and nuts and snacks whilst we lounged around the pool.The breakfast room served a great selection of cooked and continental and you're able to fill up quite substantially for the day!We found all the staff to be friendly, helpful and responsive. We required an electric adaptor and extra pillows and both things were provided within 5 minutes AND with a smile.If we visit Berlin again we shall certainly stay here again.For any Gay visitors, we found a great bar/restaurant 100 yards to the left of the hotel entrance under the arches - called ART - excellent food very reasonably priced.

<Content>Kempinski Mostly Excellent Spent two nights at the Kempinski 2-4 January 2005. Paid 拢71 per night including room upgrade from Lastminute. The room was excellent, with a very comfortable bed. The room decoration was ok, but perhaps just a little dated for a good 5 star hotel. The front desk did not know of my room upgrade offer so I had to show them the print out from the computer which they honoured, but a room of the next level up was not ready and they had to have it cleaned. Also there was hair caught in the bedhead when we got up to the room -- not a good look -- and there was lipstick on one of the towels. Eerk. But other than these things the stay was great. The staff were first rate, and the front desk spoke excellent English and were very accommodating and very knowledgeable. The pool, sauna, steam room etc is first rate, even if it is largely underground. It is very well maintained, although some may find the mixed steam room and sauna either a little confronting or exceptionally liberating according to taste. The location is fantastic, and the lobby is very comfortable -- except too many people smoking but hey, that's Germany. Didn't dine or drink in, but it did look pretty good. All in all would recommend, try to get the best deal you can, and try for the room upgrade to next available level, but I can't vouch for the next level down, because I didn't see it.

<Content>Spoiled at the Kempinski Bristol! We were spoiled rotten at this place! My wife and I stayed at the Kempinksi Bristol from 17-20 November 2004 while on our honeymoon. We were provided with a complementary bottle of champage and flowers upon arrival. Our junior suite was very reasonably priced and comfortable, with one and a half bathrooms and a separate entry hall. The room service was impeccable and moderately priced. The staff were always a pleasure, and the pool was great too. The hotel is well situated on the main street of the city, with good access to shops and cafes. It is also close to tour departure points and airports.

<Content>Hotel staff couldnt be more helpful We have just arrived back from spending 3 nights at the Kempinski hotel. From the minute we arrived we were treated like roylaty. The staff couldnt have done anymore for us. We lost our video recorder and the staff took care of it straight away.Although on previous reports on this site it mentions not to eat breakfast in the hotel due to expense we decided to order room service which was delicious although19 euro it was excellent value and enough to feed 4, first day we had breakfast in the adjioning restuarant Eck which was 21 euro and unedible uncooked sausage this was called the Berlin breakfast bewareAs far as location it was great with lots going on around you. Great trip!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Almost Excellent Hotel I stayed in this hotel from Sep 23 to Sep 26, 2004. I had gotten a great internet rate via Expedia at a little over $100 per night. I was not disappointed. This hotel is great. The location is about a 5 minute walk from the Berlin Zoo station, about 3 and 1/2 blocks away. The room was very well appointed and the bathroom was super and included a huge bathtub. They even provided bathrobes. What was really wonderful was the pool area, which I took advantage of at the end of each day. There was always a person in attendance to welcome you and attend to your every need. I used both the dry sauna and the wet steam room and they were just great, especially after a long day of walking and sighseeing. While relaxing after the steam room, the attendant even gave me some fruit, which I though was a nice touch.I just had a few minor complaints which prevents me from giving it the 5 stars or Excellent rating. First, the thermostat in the room was very crude. It was this lever that controlled the amount of air that was being forced into the room by the air conditioning. You would expect a thermostat on the wall for this class of hotel. Second, they had the strangest pillows which I found I could never get comfortable with. They are this huge square pillows that you have to fold in half to get any support for you head. I believe they were goose-down but I just had trouble with them. I didn't bother to complain and ask for conventional ones. Lastly, aside fromt the chair for use with the desk, they had an armchair for relaxation and it was not very comfortable. Not what you need after a long day.

<Content>Okay hotel-great location I received a great internet rate and after reading reviews on this site, I expected a great stay. They have certain downgraded rooms for people that get these low rates. The rooms are not the same--not even close to 5 star quality. The room was very small and the bathroom was old, dirty, smelly and gross. I was disappointed but the location was so good. If you can afford it, stay at the Zoo but if you get a good rate, stay here but don't be surprised if they put you in a crappy room.

<Content>Just Ok Perhaps I was expecting too much from this hotel. It is in a pleasant location, staff are friendly enough and our bedroom was spacious. However, the hotel does not have the 'wow' factor. To the business person, this hotel is functional but for the weekend holiday maker, like me, I found it bland and run of the mill. It lacked the personal touch.
