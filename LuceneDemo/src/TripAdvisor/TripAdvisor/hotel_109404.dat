<Content>ok stayed here last week. hotel was clean- but our airconditioner leaked water over half of the room . It would have been helpful if the front desk personnel spoke and understood english. saw many frustrated guests try to deal with that issue

<Content>Its Biggest Flaw is the Head of Housekeeping  I staid at the Candlewood suites two years ago for a extended stay and it was great. This time a big problem has been the head of housekeeping, Mr. Fernando. He is rather loud, nosy and wants to know everything about where I work, at what I am leaving, if i left for work, etc. His behaviour is weird and unprofessional and at often times you find him using the computer at the business lounge.

<Content>A nice stay! I have stayed at Candlewood Suites before -- this same one, for example -- and, as usual, had a good stay. The General Manager is up front and hands on to keep the place in good condition -- and he even helped on the front desk to do our check-in. It was a good experience right from the start!The Candlewood Cupboard was helpful as we needed a few supplies - including soap to do the dirty laundry that was piling up from the first part of our roadtrip (FREE use of machines, I might add!).Also, this is the first and only Candlewood that I've ever seen with a pool -- but it is a GREAT amenity! The pool and area was very well maintained and was definitely enjoyed after driving so many hours and being in the middle of the recent heat wave.The room is a typical Candlewood suite...but it's GREAT to know what you're going to get! The surprise on this was we were put into a one-bedroom suite -- at the same price as a regular suite! The extra room made it more like home.There is a Texas Land and Cattle restaurant within a short drive from the hotel. GREAT food! GREAT service! I want to go back to Texas just to get more ribs and then go swim in the hotel pool!The check-out process was also just as efficient and we were on our way to our next stop in no time.Once again, great work, Candlewood!

<Content>Beware!!!: Booked this hotel based on price and proximity to the American Airlines Arena (about 5 miles). Booked a double non-smoking room through Lastminutetraveler. Was told when I showed up that all double non-smoking rooms were taken and would have to take a single or a smoking room. Took the smoking room due to no other options. Stayed 4 days and never had any staff clean, make beds, or bring fresh towels.. Terrible customer service, stay away!!!

<Content>A This property is exhausted. A major make-over is past due. The concept is great. The layout of the rooms are excellant. The managers reception and breakfast are above average. The staff was very helpful and professional. The biggest problem we experianced was charges on our credit card, after we paid cash upon check-out. After calling back to this property and explaining the situation, the clerk we spoke to assured us this would be taken care of. The next week a new charge was added to the credit card along with a credit which still did not fix the problem. The following week the credit was made correctly. Even with this mix-up I would give the staff an excellant rating. They were very helpful and respectful any time we had contact with them. Although, I have to admit with the price of our stay, using our AAA discount, I would stay here again even if the property is in the same condition.

<Content>Okay' but only just okay. Nice Hotel but needs redecoration. The beds were a bit too soft and the furniture was a little old and broken in places. The bathroom was small and also needed redecoration. The front desk staff were fine. Although the night shift clerk was not very friendly when we checked in. I hope this perhaps has changed maybe he had a bad night?? The surroundings were clean and efficient. This hotel is okay for a night or two and the freeway is easily accessible from hotel.

<Content>Showing its age I've stayed here twice on business. I love Candlewoods because the rooms are comfortable - the desk in the room is perfect to work at - and the $0.25 sodas in the pantry are a nice perk. This one was looking a little worn on the inside. All of the usual Candlewood stuff is here - it's the same layout as all the other Candlewood Suites I've come across, but it is a bigger property than most. The pool is nice. In one room, there was a hole in the wall from someone opening the door too hard. In both rooms there was a fabric shower curtain that wasn't quite long enough and no vinyl liner behind it. The rooms at the front get a lot of freeway noise, so ask for a room at the back. If you need to be near downtown/market center and don't want to fight the traffic, go for this one, but if you don't mind the drive from Los Colinas, the Candlewood there is newer and nicer for about the same rate.

<Content>Candlewood Rocks!!!! My husband and I spent our week vacation there with our 4 year old and it was GREAT. We had the one bedroom suite which gave us ample room with a kitchen (and 2 TV's, very important that Baylee not miss her beloved cartoons!!) It had high speed internet access for me and was just minutes away from the Mav's at the American Airlines Center for my husband. It sits right on Stemmons so you have easy access to anywhere you want to go only about 20 minutes or so from Six Flags (without 5:00 traffic of course) The pool is enclosed in the middle so the public can't get to it. They had a reception one night with BBQ for all the guest. I left a note for the mgr about DSL at the pool area and he was quick to respond to me with a solution for the next time we stay there. The staff is very helpful anytime you need something. They have on-site groceries you can purchase(on the honor system no less) a library with books to take to your room, large TV, electric massage chair, and fresh bagels in the am. What more could you want? The longer you stay the better deal you get on the rates. (that was my experience while planning the trip anyway) 2 thumbs up!! Laurie B. Anson, Tx
