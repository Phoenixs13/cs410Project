<Content>Not 5 Star as they claim, but 3 star Upon making a reservation by phone, we were told that it is a 5 star hotel so we made the reservation. It is not a 5 star, but a 3 star. Old furniture in rooms, dark hallways, missing towels in bath, poor bath amenities, hard beds, poor shuttle service to airport.

<Content>Loved it! The hotel is in excellent shape and the service was great for a 3-4 star hotel. The rate was very reasonable for the location. We had free breakfast every day which was very good, however, the waiters were a little slow. The room service and dry cleaning service was fast and cheap! The staff was friendly and always ready to serve you. There is a restaurant about 2 minutes walking distance and more restaurants with a little shopping center about 10 minutes walking distance. The hotel also offers free airport pick up and drop off.
