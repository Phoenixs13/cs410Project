<Content>Scary, Unmentionables! As a necessity I needed to be close to the hospitals in Dallas. I needed 3 surgeries. After the last surgery the manager called and told me the monthly rent was due the day before. I went in to pay and she told me that she had left a courtesy message on my phone the day before. Phone hardly works and shows no message waiting light. Her response was that She was sorry, but I would have to pay a $15.00 late fee! This was 7:00am the very next morning no less. I had been staying there since April 08 and this was Sept. 08. Poor customer service. After I am well enough to leave I will never use their facilities again anywhere --no way! no how!Besides being a high crime area, the MANAGEMENT does not seem to care about keeping the good residents.Any complaints about anything will fall on deaf ears here. I do not recommend this facility for anyone. Empire Central and Stemmons Frwy, Dallas, TX

<Content>dog policy Guest beware of the dog policy of this company. While there is some flexibility as with size and age of pet there is a problem.Some city ordinences restrict breed of dogs allowed in city limits.We were not made aware of this until our 6th week of our extended stay.We have a large terrier mix older dog that looks like an American Pit Bull. This company does not take in to consideration that one bad apple doesnot spoil the whole bunch! We were told that we must get rid of our child because he looks like a pit bull! We were given one week to place him or move out.All in all our stay was not so bad but this one glich made our lives unbearable as we had to scramble to check out our options.This part of our stay was horrible. So if your dog is of questionable heritage please check the city ordinces and policys fully of any extend stay motel you choose.I hope this helps others not have a bad experience like we did.dog lover in dallas

<Content>Scary stay The room smelled of dog urine and the carpet was greasy feeling. We had to stay during a move for several weeks. The other guests were very undesirable and scary. It was like a ghetto. There were people using bbq grills under the stairs and against the walls and management did not take any actions on it. Lots of loud kids and adults. There seemed to be no control of the guests.

<Content>unfriendly uncooperative on-duty-manager you will be in questionable company once you check into the budget suites of dallas, tx at market center - be prepared for a ghetto-like atmosphere including junk-cars, drug-dealers and prostitutes. in the room they will not give you a blanket because they think you won't give it back - instead they ask you to use the bed-cover as substitute. that will be made of plastic and has never been cleaned. the on-duty manager will treat you like judge judy, not even close to accomodating any request at all. and they think they can do it because charges are non-refundable. the way around this is to check out early and dispute the charge with your credit-card-company. first and last time for me at this chain.
