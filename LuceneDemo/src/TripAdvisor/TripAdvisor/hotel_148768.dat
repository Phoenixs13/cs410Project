<Content>Dissapointed, Not worth the money My parents stayed in Hacienda Juanita for their honeymoon 27 years ago and I wanted for my parents to stay here again since I have never been here. Seems I will never be back. I got a 4 day/ 3 night offer which supposedly included breakfast , lunch and dinner. They never told me beverages weren't included and I had to pay extra for the aditional drinks. Desserts are also not included (another extra cost). There is a limit of $7 for breakfast and $12.50 for lunch/dinner and the prices of the food on the menu are more than the limit, so you are forced to pay extra always. Restaurant service is terrible. Tablecloths were all dirty and I noticed they were not changed for three days. The food is not of good quality and most of the menu items were not available which is extremely dissapointing. The second day of my stay front desk told me that lunch was from 12 noon to 2 pm and I arrived at 1:30. The waitress didn't want to take my order since the kitchen was closing in in 30 minutes and there were another orders before mine and there were no time to prepare mine. I was forced to eat the daily special which was a cold beef stew done since the morning.UNBELIVABLE!!! Pool was all dirty and 3 of the 5 arcades of the gaming room were not working. Housekeeping lady was very kind and nice to us (toilet paper was never missing). Bathrooms need refurbishing and no water pressure in the faucets. My offer was of $754 for the 4day/3nigh and I ended up paying over $900 because of the extras. This place its not worth the money, I will never be back.

<Content>Beautiful but wouldnt come back I enjoyed staying at Parador Hacienda Juanita (Jun 21 2008) but the parador needs urgent repair:Positives:Beautiful Property /Perfect location Nicely maintained garden Good food  Negatives:Rooms are in a desperate need of renovation, mainly bathrooms. Faucets /bathtubs need major refurbishment. Bathrooms in the restaurant area are total disgrace: broken faucets, smelly toilets / broken doors and lack of working soap containers as well as toilet paper Service: waiters need to work on multitasking better (a food order in an empty restaurant should not take one hour and 3-4 times remaining what needs to be brought up)  I thoroughly loved the plantation but wouldn鈥檛 recommend it to the friends and family given the lack of basic maintenance.

<Content>Sometimes the staff is the best of the place I am from Puerto Rico and this Christmas my family and I decided to forget about cooking at home and go to a place where we could be taken care off and spend a good time. After a beautiful but very long drive we arrive to La Hacienda Juanita. As soon as we checked in we decide to go directly to the restaurant and have something to eat and that鈥檚 when everything start to go down hill. The service was slow, they did not have many of the menu items and the food was not what we expected, and certainly not what we read about at their web site. I feel sorry for all the tourists that think they are getting the best Puerto Rican food. After dinner we went to the so call game room where only one machines does actually work, to me it looked more like a game room commentary. Since there is nothing else to do we decide to go to sleep, which at the end was very difficult without pillows and with a comforter that has not seen a washing machine in a very long time. After a few back step what really make the worst part is the lack of customer orientation the own owner of the place have, you are not going to receive a good morning, good night or even a simple smile, the only thing you are going to get is a bad humor face and a harsh or out of place comment. Although I will never go back or even recommend this place to my worst enemy and do have something nice to say about the place and is that the general staff is great, friendly and very charismatic. I think that the only way this place could be safe is if the staff runs the place instead of the owner.

<Content>Colonial Rustic Overall I rate this hotel average. It is fairly dismal in some respects, and stellar in others.Service:The establishment seems understaffed. There were gaps in the published menu and what food was really available. The food service was often behind schedule in starting for breakfast or dinner, with slow service. The breakfasts were fairly good, but the dinners were just passable insofar as table fare is concerned.Accomodations:The pool is usable, but maintenance is poor. It is up to the guest to remove the leaves and insects floating on the surface. The water was clear and cool, and the pool is large enough for lap swimming.The rooms have no air conditioning, there are no insect screens on the windows, and the bathroom facilities are aged and in need of some repair. However, the facilities did work.Cleanliness was okay and the rooms were cleaned and serviced during my absence while I was on business in Maricao during the daytime hours.I recommend walking around the compound and selecting the cabin/room you will stay in, as some are near sources of noise (like gathering locations for local parties) and others are near hotel garbage storing sites located behind some cabins. Location:This is where the hotel shines. It is on a cleared hillside in the tropical forest. The immediate grounds have nice paths and little gardens. There is a path following the periphery of the compound clearing boundary with the forest that is maintained, allowing one to treck on the forest edge. The path leaves the compound grounds near an old coffee processing machine, circles down near the tropical forest for about a quarter mile or so, traverses along the lower slope of the compound hillside and circles up hillside to re-enter the compound near the kitchen building. There are all types of insects, spiders, birds and lizards. I found a spider that has defied classification for a year. There was also a lizard lying dead near the office steps with a spider in its mouth, an apparent dinner that did not go so well. A dead mongoose on the path provided testimony to the mammalian creatures inhabiting in the area.Atmosphere:This place is reminiscent of the 1800s colonial compounds seen in old pictures. The setting, especially when in the vicinity of the cabins immediately adjacent to the restaurant building, seems to bring one back in time to a pastoral society where life is slower and the bustle of the modern world is missing.For someone used to camping and seeking a rustic and secluded night or two with a real bed, running water and available services, this place is great. I worked in Maricao during the day, but had I the time, a great day could have been had with an early morning walk along the path (I did this), a day of reading and viewing from the restaurant building veranda and an evening swim (I did this) before retiring early. I would recommend bringing a good book or two and a pair of binoculars. This would allow a person to have two or three days of peaceful, introspective adventure.

<Content>This is one of those places that you leave behind as soon as you can. I had been to this place about 15 years ago, and unfortunately, the place has become a dump. The ladies in the front desk could not have cared less about our arrival, and the second lady late in the day was more interested in her homework than in answering our questions. There was a small puppy that was way friendlier than the front desk attendants. The rooms are despicable: dark and musty. The bathroom is absolutely filthy. When I looked inside the bathtub I was totally disgusted. The food at the restaurant was very good, and the view is nothing to call home about.

<Content>Fantastic Loved this place, its so peaceful and relaxing. The staff and owners were all really nice, taking the time to chat with us over a drink and making us feel really at home.The rooms are pretty basic to be honest but they fit in with the surroundings - they feel like they belong in the setting and the hotel compliments rather than scars the beautiful landscape.Had some lovely food in the restaurant, all home made (I think by the owners mum) and authentic puerto rican dishes on offer. Great range of rums to try in teh bar aswell if I remember rightly.Sort of place you could happily hang around for a few days, just lounging reading books and chatting. Great place.

<Content>Run For Your Life.............. Once you get there you may be welcomed by the coqui's beacause there isn't any staff to do so. When I made my reservation I was told that my room key would be left for me inside of my room because there wasn't any personel on staff at 10 PM. (I wasn't smart enough to get the hint!!) Once I get to my room at the roach motel after several minutes of searching for it. Yes my key was there along with the dirty room, but it was so late I didn't dare to leave. I was up at 6 AM due to the small and uncomfortable bed. When I left at 7 AM I had to leave the key in the room because once again there weren't any employees only to be contacted by the owners wife, Maria Elena, very rudley questioning me why I left so early and left empty cans in the garbage at the room. I felt very scared after this phone call. Please Don't Go There.

<Content>Hacienda Roachita The grounds were nice but if you compare a room here with on at Motel 6, the Motel 6 would be a 5 star hotel. The bed was very very small and hard, the windows have no glass or screens to keep the bugs out except for wooden shutters. To compound the problem your only means of trying to cool off is a single fan. Do not open the shutters to get fresh air into your room or you will be eaten alive by the swarms of hungry mosquitoes! Oh, and if you have to get up in the middle of the night because of the crowing of the roosters, you better turn on the light and wait a couple of seconds before you make your way to the restroom to give the biggest roaches I have ever seen a chance to run off and hide. Puerto Rico is a great. If you want to see a coffee plantation take a trip to Hacienda Buena Vista. It is well worth it. Save you time and money (as it takes a lot of both if you stay here) and visit the islands many other wonderful places!

<Content>A true jewel hidden in the mountains of P.R. This Parador was exactly what I was expecting. If you enjoy the fresh air of the mountains, the sounds of the coqui (small native frogs) at night and really good creole food...look no further. Even tough the driving is not a piece of cake, the peace that you'll find once you get there will make you forget all about it.

<Content>Would not stay here again Hmmm...two five-star reviews and one one-start review...what to do?After looking at the Web site, my husband and I decided to risk it. You know what they say about hindsight.The pros: Lovely views, falling asleep to the sound of coquis, breakfast and dinner included in the price of the room, a friendly dog (her name is Juanita). The inn is well located for everything we wanted to do on the west side of the island.The cons-Once you leave the highway, getting to HJ involves driving along very narrow mountain roads and PR drivers are pretty wild. We wanted to go to the bioluminescent bay near Lajas, but frankly were downright scared to drive back after dark!!-Room and bathroom were not all that clean. One day they forgot to give us a clean/dry bathmat.-The restaurant wasn't very clean either.-Water took forever to heat up. -One morning there was no water at all because of no electricity [pole down because of overnight accident]. While this cannot be helped, there was no back-up plan other than giving the guests bottled water.-The restaurant is a meson gastronomico, but the food and service weren't all that great, they were out of something we wanted at least 3 times and often forgot to bring everything that came with our meal. (Annie was by far the best waitress. Another practiced her English on us and was quite charming, though.) At least the beer was cold.It wasn't bad enough to make us leave, but we wouldn't go back and wouldn't suggest it to anyone else.

<Content>Major disappointmnet. No welcome upon arrival. Deserted grounds and sullen staff. Room stark  barren, no charm, with a desolete run-down feeling. Despite gastronomic claims, most items on menu were not available. Food we ordered did not fit menu discription. Service was abysmal. Pool dirty. Worst issue: Rooster started crowing at 11pm and continued until 7am, preventing sleep and prompting our immediate departure.

<Content>Found Paradise in Hacienda Juanita My fiancee and I stayed at Hacienda Juanita two years ago. It was my first trip to Puerto Rico, but my fiancee grew up there. I fell in love with this parador. It was so far removed from everday life. You wake up in the morning, open your window shudders and look out into a lush tropical forest. You can spend all day wandering around the grounds, going swimming, hiking trails, or laying in bed. They play festive music nightly, and the food is AMAZING. I can honestly say that it was the best food I have ever eaten. You can haveyour meals on their terrace which overlooks the tropical landscape, or you can eat in the main dining room or even have the food sent to your room. The service is excellent and the area is gorgeous. It has been two years since I was at Hacienda Juanita, and I can't stop talking about it!
