<Content>Convenient to exit 152 of freeway I-5; basic amenities useful for a short stay The motel comprises several, connected, two-story (ground- and second-floor) buildings with internal corridors. The far back facing away from traffic on S.188th street and I-5 probably has quieter rooms.A pleasant, cooperative receptionist, at our request, assigned to us a room on the upper floor. We stayed one weekday night while on our way south, and it worked out successfully. The double-glazed windows effectively blocked noise from the parking area outside.The motel did not seem completely full, so we cannot say what to expect if all rooms were occupied. It would depend on the behavior of other guests. The gap at the bottom of the door can admit noise from the corridor.The location, very convenient to exit 152 leading to and from I-5, appears popular and to attract a variety of customers. For an extended stay, you might want to consider elsewhere. Also, management should have the outside-access key-card locks at the emergency exits repaired so that they work.

<Content>questionable business practices I booked this motel through the Motel 6 website - where it stated credit card required to guarantee for late arrival or something similar. So I trusted this motel with my credit card information, and I trusted the website. I left a note that I would be arriving late and even stated after 10PM. My flight was late, and I arrived after midnight. The clerk was rude and nasty and had sold my room to someone else for a higher rate. She barked you were supposed to be here at 10 o-clock, and I've charged your credit card. She growled there was nothing she could do for me, and I would have to come back and speak with the manager in the morning.First of all, I can understand that the credit card is required in case I don't show up, so they don't lose money, but this motel is running a scam and making twice the money off the room - by re-selling rooms at higher rates to drop-ins, and refusing to refund money to those who reserved and showed up.Second, why would I want to waste my time speaking with a manager who authorizes his staff to conduct those types of business practices. I'm travelling, I don't have time to waste running around over $60. Also - she gave me a printout of the charges, but they don't actually supply any phone numbers or names to that particular hotel, so you can't call them anyway unless you go to a lot of trouble.The invoice did state the motel was independently owned - so I don't think this is standard practice for Motel 6, but beware of this motel. In the end, I called the Motel 6 company complaints line, and eventually got my credit card refunded - and the company was very helpful and did not question this as it is obviously dishonest.Although I was able to get my money back, I think it is important to know the potential problems you may face with this hotel.In summary - this motel tried to rip me off, were not helpful and have the most unprofessional staff I have encountered.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised I was pleasantly surprised - this was good value for money. The rooms are fairly spacious, seem to be rather new, that is including the carpet and bathroom. You could detect some stains occassionally if you looked really close, but this is no 4 star hotel. The room was clean. I would recommen trying to ask for rooms in the middle wing of the motel - this is the most quiet. The wing faicing the interstate gets the noise from the road, but if you turn on the airconditioning, you do not hear the road noise, only the ac. The check-in process is painfully slow if you check-in after 10 pm and there are more people waiting. Overall, I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>MMmmmm... Basic hotel right near SEA-TAC airport. Low price, but noisy at night from nearby sports bar nightclub, but really convenient location. Rooms spacious but basic. Good if you need short term accommodation near airport.

<Content>Convenient for early a.m. flight and to return rental car. After a week long trip, we had an early a.m. flight out of SeaTac. I was looking for an inexpensive motel that was close to the airport, close to our rental car return and in a safe neighborhood. This motel met our needs.The room was TINY, but hey, it is Seattle and Motel 6. No frills, of course and the usual itty bitty towels, but it fit all of our requirements and got us off to a good start on our return trip home. Just what we needed!It was less than 5 minutes from the airport and the car rental!
