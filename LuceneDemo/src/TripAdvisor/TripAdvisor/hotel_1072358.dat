<Content>good budget great hotel, cheap enough, been stay in this hotel twice, once in standard once in superior. Standard room is smaller. Superios room with twin bed. Bed is amazingly narrow, watch where you sleep, you could fell off.But other than that everything is perfect, furniture and furnish is brand new and completely functioning, LCD tv. No window on very room I think, they cover the windows with green sheets.Aircon works OK, bathroom abit small but good and clean.Location is very good close to everywhere, particularly closed to simlim for IT shopping and bugis.Will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Mod hotel close to everything Stayed in the 3bedded family room (which is the largest when we looked at a double room) for 2nites which was just nice for the three of us. It is close to Queen Street (5mins) and Bugis MRT (10mins) and Serangoon Rd,Little India (5mins). The rooms were nice, new, n clean as the hotel had just opened beginning this year. Liked the LCD tv, power showers, helpful front desk staff and comfy beds. Good value for a budget boutique hotel. As for breakfast - not included but no worries as there are good eateries everywhere. Would recommend this for all, shoppers, backpackers etc. Only gripe is that there are not enuff cupboards and places to hang stuff. A bedside table wud also be good.
