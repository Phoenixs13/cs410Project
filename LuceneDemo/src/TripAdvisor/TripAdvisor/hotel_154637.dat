<Content>Nice Hotel - A few Complaints I stayed here for 3 nights in September for business. The hotel feels safe and is in a decent location. It is close to shopping and restaurants but a taxi is necessary.The room was big and modern. I think the bed was a little hard, but there is a large flat screen tv and the bathroom was very nice. The restaurant downstairs is decent. The menu is not big and the service is a little slow, but the food is fine.My biggest complaint about this hotel is the wireless internet service. It is horrible! All three days at the hotel- the service was spotty at best. I called the front desk and I believe they know they have problems with the wireless internet. (internet with an ethernet cable is not available). The front desk was very rude about the problem as it seemed as though they are also frustrated by it.

<Content>Good experience, but... Stayed a week at the Royal while visiting my daughter who is a college student in Mexico City. Overall a very good experience. Price was same as I booked via Travelocity and the room was very nice and clean. Service was very good and the lobby restaurant was exceptional for a lobby restaurant. Nice pool and spa. Now for the however....lots of street noise at night even though the room is quite some distance off the street. The location is in a business complex area with no shops or restaurants within walking distance, so a taxi ride is necessary for everything. Finally, I arranged through the front desk for a taxi the airport at the end of our stay at a fixed rate. The driver did the classic and raised the price once we got to the airport.Overall a nice hotel and good experience.

<Content>Great Hotel at Reasonable Price I have stayed here twice - each time for four days - and it is excellent. The rooms are large, lots of TV channels, lovely and comfortable ambiance, good restaurant in the hotel, friendly and attentive service from the staff. Sounds like I'm related to the owners, right? I am not. Even the bed sheets smell delicious. I highly recommend this hotel.
