<Content>Nice Location! Hotel Denit is located 2 minutes away from plaza Catalunya, which means it is the centre of Barcelona.It is a brand new with nice style 3 stars hotel.The business room has a good size, a large plasma TV , nice bathroom although there were missing some small details like a brush for the toilet.A good detail was the size of the towels... huge!There is no refrigerator in the room which is not good.The breakfast was poor : toast bread, 3 kind of jam, honey, juice , croissant, coffee and a kind of sweet. That's all!When we asked for an espresso they respond that it was not possible, although in the lobby you can have one.The value for money was really good, 79euro per night including breakfast.In general I believe it will be a good hotel after a while because now Denit has some problems especially with the staff which is unprofessional and they don't have the experience to handle some situations or be flexible , in order the visitors leave the place with a very good impression.

<Content>Disappointing Although the hotel is in a good location, we were very disappointed with the poor service received from the staff, who were remarkably inflexible, considering how new the hotel is, and had a poor understanding of their own terms and conditions.Next time, we will be booking with a more established hotel.

<Content>Not terrible but not great either.. The hotel Denit is in a great location, just a minute's wak from the plaza Catalunya and the Ramblas, but on a quiet side street so it wasn't noisy at all. The hotel is simply but stylishly decorated in clean white. To be completely honest it is finished in quite cheap materials (the flooring outside our room looked a little like chipboard) but the overall look is clean and modern. It's a very IKEA look.Our room was advertised as a double room with a shower-room, but it was in fact two single beds pushed together, and the shower-room turned out to be a wetroom (basically a large shower cubicle with a toilet inside. The bathroom fittings were very nice though, with a large overhead shower and an additional small handheld shower head. Water pressure was good and there was always plenty of hot water. The room also had a small wall-mounted LCD TV in front of the bed and a small writing desk. There were no tea and coffee making facilities or minibar in the room, but there was a coffee machine and a large fridge with soft drinks and sandwiches in the lobby. There is breakfast included in the price of the meal- albeit a very basic spread of bread which we had to toast ourselves and a selection of cookies and cheap budget supermarket pastries. There was a woman overlooking the breakfast who really relished having all of that power, first by telling us off for using the wrong elevator (this was the elevator that was right in front of our room door). The next morning she told us we were too late for breakfast (despite the fact that we had come down exactly the same time the day before). And finally I was sent away from breakfast on the last morning for not wearing proper shoes. The rest of the staff were fairly good though. The lady that checked us in was very friendly. She initially gave us the wrong room key and we ended up going into an already occupied room, but she apologised and sorted out the problem quickly and efficiently.So in conclusion:1. Great location2. Quiet3. Clean and stylish4. Cheap-ishBut:1. Wetroom2. No tea and coffee facilities or minibar3. Variable staff
