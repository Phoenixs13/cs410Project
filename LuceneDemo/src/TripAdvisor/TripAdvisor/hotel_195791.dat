<Content>Great, Clean Hotel! This Hotel was just perfect. We had a One bedroom suite. It had a full bedroom with bath and a seperate living/ full kitchen area. It also had a balcony. It was so great for the price. The bed was a california king , triple sheeted and so comfortable. We enjoyed our stay and I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice , clean place to stay. The staff members were great as well. Full hot breakfast.

<Content>Great Location, Unconfortable Beds I have spent just one night after a cuise at this Staybridge. Got a good $50 rate at Priceline, and wi-fi, parking and breakfest were included.Our room was very nice, with a queen bed, a working area, a mini-kitchen and a sitting area. Altough it was clean, the bed was not confortable.They have free shuttles to mia airport, which was good.Breakfest is ok. Service was good.

<Content>Loved it. Would stay again! Staff ( especially Diana Alaniz, who checked us in) were very friendly and helpful. The room (a studio suite), was clean and comfortable, with kitchen area, couch area, and bedroom area. Although we did not use it, a desk area with free wireless internet was available in the room. There was a dining area (for the free breakfast buffet)off the Lobby, a fitness room, and a library, and hard- wired computers were available in a room off the Lobby. The hot breakfast buffet was included in the room rate and items were plentiful and kept restocked, with a great variety of hot and cold items. The hotel had many safety features, including use of room keycard to get to and from rooms via elevator. It offers most amenities to rate it as 3 star hotel. The hotel appears to be in a safe area in Miami. You do need a car to get around, as I did not see public transportation available in that area, although we may have missed it and did not ask. We recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again if in Miami.Elizabeth Thompson Date of stay 10/18/08

<Content>Great for passing thru Miami...try Cuban restaurant they recommend! We stayed here for a quick overnight en route from Dominican Republic back to SFO. We were pleasantly surprised. The suite was simple but clean, no frills. The free shuttle service was superb. It did the job what we were looking for. The highlight for us, however, was the Gourmet Cuban restaurant one of the front desk girls recommended. We had never eaten Cuban food, so wanted to give it a shot. OMG, we were completely blown away by La Rosa's Cuban Restaurant. The Staybridge gives you a free shuttle ride over there, and believe it or not that was one of the highlights of our trip! The beef tenderloin was unbelievable and the fish outstanding. Not to mention the fried green banana chips that taste better than potato chips, I kid you not.The only drawback is that the early morning (5amish) staff is not as attentive as the evening staff, but overall we were happy with our stay. And DEFINITELY try La Rosa's Cuban Restaurant!!

<Content>Always liked Staybridge I have been a big fan of the Staybridge product. I think that they offer a lot for your money. The lobby is gorgeous and unlike any other Staybridge I've seen... and that's saying a lot!Breakfast was typical Staybridge: Make your own waffles, yogurt, juice, fruit, various breads, etc. They had biscuits and gravy for their hot item that day. Hotel shuttle from the airport was prompt and front desk arranged for a taxi to go to the port for our cruise. Outdoor pool looked great and little courtyard was cute. Mosquitos are always a problem in FL so bring some repellant. Plenty of restaurants around, but we were tired and had Pizza delivered to the room. Convenience shop was expensive, but convenient.Studio suite looked like all of the others I had been in: Queen size bed, sofa-bed, desk, chair, 27-inch TV, kitchenette, large fridge and microwave. I also like the fact that the there are two sinks: One for the bathroom that is outside of the commode and shower room, and the kitchen sink. If you are travelling with one child or two small children a studio would work, but there are one bedroom suites that are bigger and provide a little privacy for mom and dad and are not that much more. I have been upgraded on occasion to two bedroom suites when overbooked on one bedrooms and these are ideal for families with many children and/or teenagers.I would recommend this Staybridge to anyone!

<Content>good location, clean and functional on a quick business trip to miami and decided to take wife and small children. staybridge suites is very convenient to a myriad of business locations in the airport and doral areas. after business completed on friday, we decided to do metro zoo on saturday and then on sunday we grabbed lunch at bayside before flying home. contrary to another review that hotel is inconvenient to activities, we were at metro zoo in 20 minutes, and about the same to bayside (downtown waterfront shopping area). i will note that traffic in the area is pretty intense on weekdays during rush hour, but that's to be expected in any large metro area. there are dozens of nearby restaurants to suit all tastes.as for the hotel itself: the rooms are ideal for traveling with small children (or on solo business). internet in rooms, small kitchenette with medium sized refrigerator, microwave and stove. the living room had a couch and a nice t.v. the bedroom was cramped with two full sized beds. overall, the furnishings seemed nice and functional. the room was clean.the staff was friendly, eagerly providing directions when asked. no problem getting more towels, etc when needed.the hotel property shares a pool with the adjacent holiday inn and it looked nice, but we didn't use it.breakfast was fine. plenty of everything and not too crowded on the weekend. it's one of those hotels that caters to weekday business travelers.all in all, we'd defenitely stay there again.

<Content>Some problems but its okay overall Breakfast buffet was running out of items before 9:00 and they were not replaced....bedding was not that comfortable and the rooms were not laid out well for a suite-style hotel. The property seemed to be in decent shape but is not in the best area. There are, however, many places to eat in the immediate area. Not the best location for things to do activities-wise.

<Content>Not Recommended We noted that during our stay the hotel was undergoing some renovations, but those aside we were somewhat disappointed with the hotel, especially in comparison with other Staybridge Suites locations we have stayed at in California and New York.We were surprised and disappointed that basic microwave cooking utensils were not available when requested, for example, and that the television picture was terrible. A request for the later to be addressed went unanswered as did a request for an extra chair.The windows in the room were streaked and dirty and there was mold on the edge of the tub in the bathroom. The garberator came apart when we used it, and the general appearance of the hotel entry was scruffy, including the elevator and room furnishings. The mattress on the bed also seemed old and tired. Food service was also not up to the standard we experienced at California locations.
