<Content>Happy at Hamptons Stayed for one night after a long late flight. Easy to find after collecting car at Budget Car Hire (Dolphin Expressway and Florida Turnpike ) The staff at reception were very pleasant and we were in our room within 5 minutes of arriving. Had a burger and chip in Tiki Bar. This was perfect as we did not want to travel again that night. Breakfast the next morning was excellent (part of the price). We paid $111 for 4 people and I thought this was excellent. Considering I booked about 6 months previously I was most impressed when they honored a price reduction which came into effect in May 08. (I email them when i noticed a lower price on other websites AND THEIR OWN) Would definitely stay again if looking for a stop over hotel

<Content>No Thanks Room was on the 1st floor near the lobby, very loud in the morning once breakfast started at 6 am. The 1st night went to take a shower and there was something yellow and greasy in the tub. Called the front desk and 30 minutes later a maid showed up and cleaned the tub. Tub was still very slippery and difficult to stand in, felt awful on your feet. The bathroom was very dark, had to apply my make-up out in the room. We were travelling with another couple, went to the pool there were 3 lounge chairs. Seems ridiculous for a hotel pool. Beds were comfortable, breakfast was average. Desk staff was very friendly.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Convenient Location My husband and I spent one night here prior to leaving on a trip to the Florida Keys. Our flight got into Miami late and I was a little concerned about finding the hotel, but the directions from the website were great and we had no problems finding it.The room and bath were generously sized, including a sitting area with a couch and small table. The furnishings could use some updating, but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. I saw an exercise room and laundry facilities, which would certainly be a plus for longer stays.The continental breakfast in the lobby in the morning was very nice, with various basic choices - quite enough to get you started for the day.The staff was pleasant and helpful, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Nice hotel friendly service. My husband and I, along with my two adult children, came early to Miami before our cruise and stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. We did not want to live too close to the airport, and the location of this hotel was perfect. There were many restaurants and two major malls within short driving distance. The front desk person was very helpful in directing us to a nearby cuban restaurant that served delicious Cuban food. Would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>We loved it! We stayed at this hotel for one night prior to going on a cruise. We chose this hotel for a number of reasons, it's free airport shuttle, the free breakfast  the close proximity to the huge Dolphin Mall....as I was travelling with 2 teenagers, this gave us something to do the night before, lots of great shopping, dining  entertainment options there. We were picked up at the airport within 20 minutes of my calling, by a very friendly  informative shuttle driver, Juan. Juan also later drove us to the mall  came back and picked us up again when we were done....I was very impressed by this, as it's not something that the hotel advertises, just a simple courtesy that saved me money on taxi's...Juan even stopped for us so we could take pictures....this went a long way for us! All of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, right from the moment we checked-in....they even arranged our transportation the next day to the cruise terminal. Everyone seemed genuinely happy to be working there, as there was always a smile and a warm hello from the staff. The rooms were clean and very comfortable, we all slept great. A big plus was the free breakfast the next day, especially with my 2 very hungry kids...everything was delicious and fresh. The free internet was also a plus. Overall this hotel was a very pleasant place to stay, a great value for the money. I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Nice Hotel That Lived Up to the Hampton Name It truly was a pleasure to stay at this hotel. Staff was friendly and accomodating; hotel and hotel premises were clean. We had a second story double room that was spacious, quiet, and private. Internet hookup (although not wireless, at least in my room) was adequate - they provided an ethernet cable in the room. Breakfast was nice, with a higher than average selection of food compared to other Hamptons. Parking was a bit tight, but nothing to complain about. In the lobby, you will find a convienient business center that allowed me to print my airplane boarding passes (at no cost) the day before I departed. The architecture was nice as well - for a 2 star hotel anyway.In regards to the reviewer that noted the loud music and partying in the downstairs bar, I was fortunate enough to avoid this experience. While there were some people down there at night, they were absolutely no bother to me at all. Perhaps his/her experience was an isolated incident. (I wanted to comment on this, as it was a concern for me, especially during a weekend in which the hotel was to be full.)For the race fans out there: We stayed at this hotel for the Homestead NASCAR race weekend, November 2006. Looking for something that was along Florida's Turnpike, this seemed to be in a decent location. About a 25-30 minute drive to the speedway - at the time, it was the best we could find.

<Content>Overrated but still a good choice We stayed here July 21st for one night. The room was decent but could have been larger and cleaner (dust on wall-to-wall carpet in the room, stains in the corridor, one Q-tip behind a piece of furniture). People had a picnic on the tables near the pool on the evening and nothing was cleaned up in the morning so it made a bad impression looking outside. But the staff was pleasant and the breakfast really very good with a lot of choice and delicious cakes. The location is good if you just stop here to sleep.

<Content>Decent, but shouldn't be in the Top 10 I recently stayed at the Doral Hampton Inn for one night on business. There were some things I liked about it, and some other things that I really didn't like. All in all, it was adequate, but I don't think it should be listed as one of the Top 10 hotels in Miami (not including Miami Beach hotels). I would only recommend it for business travelers (but don't get a pool-view room...see below) and/or people needing a hotel near the Turnpike. Pros:--Free shuttle bus is available to pick you up from the airport (or take you to the airport) and can also take you to/from nearby restaurants, Doral mall, etc. Very nice if you don't have a car--Free breakfast in the morning. I didn't go for the hot breakfast, though it looked decent enough, but I did take one of the free to-go breakfasts which was convenient and easy--Clean room. The bathroom tiles could use some grout cleaning but otherwise it was adequate--Free internet...a nice perk!--Very very good air conditioningCons: --The biggest con for me was the outdoor bar next to the pool. My window faced the pool, and the bar was VERY loud until about midnight. It was supposed to close at 11 but stayed open since there were people there. People screaming, music, etc. And this was on a Tuesday night! A related negative of the hotel would be that there isn't any nightlife nearby to speak of, so everyone just goes to the hotel bar. If staying at the Hampton, I'd highly recommend requesting a room that doesn't have a pool view. --As noted above, there isn't any nightlife and very few restaurants to speak of in the vicinity. There is no restaurant in the hotel at night. Your only options are to order in, drive to the Doral mall (nearby, but not walking distance), or have the shuttle bus take you somewhere and then pick you up later. --The pillows are very thick and hard...if you like flatter, softer pillows...bring your own or stay elsewhere--In my room, the desk was right next to the air conditioning, and since the air conditioning is so good, I couldn't have it on while working at the desk. So, I couldn't turn on the A/C until I went to bed. Minor point, but thought I'd mention it

<Content>Excellent Hotel Chain This is the last of 5 hotels my family and I stayed in during our 2 week trip to Florida and we were very impressed with the standards of this chain of hotels.We tried to get in the other Hampton Inn that was nearer the airport but it was full. However, this place was fine. Exceptional levels of cleanliness, the staff were brilliant and extremely helpful, even though we only stayed for the one night. Out of the five hotels, this had by far the most comprehensive breakfast whichwas very well presented and not laced in sugar! They also had free internet access on 2 PC's which kept my kids quiet all morning as we waited in their lobby. You have to vacate your room by 11am and we did not need to leave for the airport until 1pm. They very kindly let us stay in their comfortable reception area and even provided free coffee!We had a twin bedded room which only cost $157 for the night which was very reasonable indeed. We can highly recommend this hotel and if we go to the States in the future, I am going to seriously look at staying at this chain of hotels - they have put a lot of thought into them as to what a customer wants...PS There is a Tony Romas just up the road as well!

<Content>Clean Room  Our family stayed here for 3 nights in March and found the staff really helpful and the room was clean. We used the shuttle to the airport and really enjoyed talking to the driver. We also appreciated the availabiltiy of a washer/dryer as we used them before heading off on our cruise. Only one small complaint was I found the one bedroom suite to be a bit cluttered with too much furniture. Anyways the room was clean and would definitely recommend it. If your planning to stay here before a cruise, the taxi to the port was $46.

<Content>Good deal Customer service was great... definitely a good hotel for the price... if you are used to a Westin, W or something along that lines, this is not for you. Good basic hotel. Clean, a little on the older side, but free shuttle, breakfast, and workout room!

<Content>Service is the key! We came in at night, and we were taken care of instantly! we flew in from American Arlines, we called the hotel and they had a pick up van there in 15 mins. I believe Nathan and Albert or Alex i forget who was at the front desk, checked us in, and upgraded us to a suite right away! overall outstanding service and very nice property.

<Content>Great Value I've stayed at many Hampton Inns around the country and found this location to be one of the better ones. Basically, everything you would expect from a Hampton Inn plus more. I am a bit biased though, because I feel that Hampton Inn is the absolute best chain in the mid/high-budget category. Higher end chains generally do not offer free hot breakfast, wireless internet, and parking (even at airport locations).I appreciated some of the extras offered at this location, which are not always present at other Hampton Inns, such as the cookies at reception and a nicely-sized business/computer center. There was even a tiki-bar at the pool that served food.Internet worked fine in the room and the bedding looked new, was comfortable, and there were many nice pillows. I have also stayed at the Hampton Inn Miami Airport/Blue Lagoon which is highly ranked at this site and generally charges higher rates. This Hampton Inn Miami West, to me, seemed to be just as good as the Airport/Blue Lagoon location. I believe both have a free airport shuttle.I will certainly stay at this location again.

<Content>Great Hotel The staff was very courteous and helpful. However, we reserved a double smoking room and received a nonsmoking suite because the hotel was supposedly booked up. It was nice to be upgraded to a suite but the shower was designed for handicapped individuals which made it difficult to take showers without getting water all over the bathroom floor. It was great to have the extra space though. Our room was facing the poolside bar and we didn't have problems with any noise coming from the bar. The bartender makes great apple martinis! Also, they have breakfast each morning with eggs, sausage, bagels, pastries, etc. Overall the hotel is very nice with clean rooms. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Place This hotel is perfect! Great rates, We paid $89.00 a night, we booked a room with two beds and they upgrade us because we belong to the Hilton frequent stay program...they did with out us having to ask! Great suite(and very clean) with full kitchen,which is great if you have kids. They have a pool, very clean and next to the pool there's a tiki bar! Not usual for Hampton's but it's a plus! to have drinks while the kids are on the pool.The lobby is real nice, they have a huge aquarium, kids loved it!The front desk was very helpful and they gave my kids a puppet to play and keep!I will stay there again and highly recommend!

<Content>Pretty good I just completed a four night stay at this Hampton which began one day after the other review of this place was posted. By and large, I agree with their comments - this place is all around pretty nice and good value for the dollar. I do have some other points I'd like to address. The previous reviewer mentioned the outdoor bar area. That isn't a bad deal (I don't drink) but I would caution people having a room facing the pool area - even with the windows closed and the air conditioning running, I did hear too much noise coming from this area. If you are a light sleeper/go to bed early/or simply don't like the noise, you should definately try and get a room not facing the pool. The previous reviewer also mentioned being right next to the FL turnpike. That is convenient, but be advised I found it rather difficult/risky exiting the parking lot in the morninig rush hour and trying to reenter it in the afternoon. One final note - I personally evaluated hotels (both high end and low end) on how they execute the small things. It did bother me that several days I didn't receive a newspaper and that as a Platinum member of the Hilton Honors program I didn't receive any recognition for that status. Small stuff to be sure, but that was factored into why I didn't give it an excellent rating.

<Content>Would stay again!!!! Stayed at the Hampton Inn for seven days. Rooms were clean and comfortable, good value for the money. Cont'l Bfast from 6-10am each day, good selection and good quality. Local phone calls are free and all rooms have free high speed internet access which is awesome is you travel with a laptop or on business. Hotel has a business center with computers to use free of charge. Hotel has a patio/pool area in center courtyard with an outdoor awning covered bar/grille that is open during the evening 3pm to 2am with bigscreen tv and regular tv's with all of the sports games on. This area is quite popular and is always crowded. Also the bartender Molly is great and makes great drinks!!! The hotel is right next to the FLA turnpike which makes it easy to go north or south without having to get on the palmetto expressway (terrible traffic and construction). There are alot of shopping centers and restaurants within a 10 minute drive of the hotel and the shuttle drivers will take you anywhere within a short distance of the hotel. The only negatives related to the stay is the location. If you like to go downtown Miami or South Beach, it is a bit of a drive (20 to 30 min) If you are staying for business or visiting freinds or family in the NW or SW parts of Miami/Dade county this hotel can't be beat. The hotel is also close to the Dolphin mall and the Doral Country Club.
