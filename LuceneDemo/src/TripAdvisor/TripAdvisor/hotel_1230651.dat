<Content>Great value new hotel in Sydney Apparently only been open a few weeks Clean comfy room with wi fi which is a bonus. Was only in Sydney overnight to catch up with mates and got a dirt cheap rate. Much cheaper than Darling Harbour hotels and brand new. Will definately use this when I travel to sydney for work in New Year. Cheap clean and central - definately worth checking out.
