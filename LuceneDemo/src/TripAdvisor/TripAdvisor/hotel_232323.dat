<Content>Warm Customer Service from Beginning til End with Luce the Manager From the minute I checked in I was greeted very warmly by a very handsome gentleman named Luce. He even upgraded my room at no charge!The room was warm and cozy and decorated very nicely.The room and bathroom were clean with extra toliet paper and a heating towel rack with plenty of towels!The breakfast was a full course of sausages, eggs, croisants, rolls, bread for making toast, an assortment of cheeses, cold meats, very good coffee, orange juice and a variety of cereals. The chef kept refilling everything for the guests and was friendly.The hotel was very close to the famous museums within walking distance of the hotel. The Tram from Central Staation (line #16) took be directly to the street, and it was a 5 minute walk to the hotel.There was an outstanding Italian Restaurant across the street where I ate for dinner twice, it was that delicious!There is a church across the street that has a bell tower and you should know that on the hour the bell rings the hour but uses restraint in the wee hours of the night.

<Content>Dont stay here!!!! This hotel was a real disappointment, apparently its a 3*, but we wouldnt give it a 2*!It's not in a prime location of Amsterdam and you need to get a tram there from the station. On our arrival we were allocated a twin room, even though we had booked a classic double room and had paid for it well in advance. The room was terrible, the bed linen was filthy, covered in stains, the room was dated and covered in dust.We were eventually allocated a double room. although the room was bigger, the bed lined was dirty, and the shower was blocked, you could shower for approx 4min before you'd flood the bathroom!!Additionally, we found some of the staff rude and unhelpful, for example, on our booking form it stated that we would have to pay 24 euros city tax when checking out, however, we were made to pay this amount on our arrival and the staff were quite demanding.There are no views from the hotel.The rooms are strictly no smoking.Terrible building works next door, banging 6am onwards.Bed lined  towels were not changed during our 5 night stay.Some good points!!!*Some nice quiet bars and restaurants in the area.*Ideal for middle aged, non-smokers  non partying people!! *Breakfast was ok.But we wouldnt stay here again, if you want a good hotel, stay at the NH amsterdam in lidelsplein!! Great location and service plus you can smoke!! Book in advance and you'l get it cheap!!

<Content>not as good as you'd expect from a ' 4* ' hotel You should realize that somethings not right when you've booked a three star hotel but the sign outside says its a four star. We wouldn't give it a two star!This hotel is rubbish! It's not in a prime location of Amsterdam and you need to get a tram there from the station. The staff ignored us when we tried to book in and were quite obnoxious. They weren't very helpful and not pleasant at all. The room was very disappointing, as it had not been cleaned from the previous occupant. We had to empty the fridge, dispose of bathroom waste and generally tidy up. During our five day stay it wasn't cleaned once. With wall paper torn and hanging off in places it was very untidy and dusty. Breakfast was ok but nothing special. It tarnished our stay in Amsterdam as everyone else we met was friendly and provided good customer service. NOT RECOMMENDED!

<Content>Omega Hotel..... The hotel is okay but in need of updating. We had a double room with en-suite shower/wc. This was great except that our balcony door would not close due to a faulty lock and the shower doors were broken. However, the room was very clean and comfortable. The bells on the nieighbouring church will drive you mad, chiming every half an hour all day and all night!!! Breakfast in the hotel was simple but nice. The hotel is a minute walk from the nearest tram stop which will take you straight in to the heart of Amsterdam, fantastic!!Would recommend this hotel if you are using it is as a base and not planning on spending too much time there! Absolutely fine to sleep, have breakfast and then go out for the day!! Overall, had a fab time!!

<Content>Beware room 43!! I read other reviews before booking, and most were ok. We were unlucky though - went for a romantic Valentine's break  found that not only was our 'double' a twin (which I know is typically European), but the beds were squeezed into a room so tiny they would only fit in an L shape with no chance of sleeping anywhere near each other... We tried to share one bed but ended with my face jammed against a wall cos the room was so cramped. On the plus side, breakfast was good (though served til 10, not 11 as advertised - late nighters beware), and location was quiet but not too far from attractions. Just stipulate that you don't want room 43 when you book!

<Content>Great priced hotel for amsterdam Me and three friends stayed at the Omega Hotel in early september of 2006. The hotel is situated just outside the main Dam square and Leidsplien. To get to the hotel there is a tram line to Omega Hotel. Get the Tram No 2 from central station and get off at Jacob Obrechtstraat stop. The hotel is on the road behind the tram stop. The hotel rooms were fine, as were the bathroom. All rooms with TV . The only problems with the hotel, was the AC did not work and there is a church opposite the hotel, which has a bell that rings on the 1/2 hour. Did not bother us, but could affect a light sleeper. Amsterdam is an amzing city, which has so much to offer. The is a fantastic little bakery on the main road behind the hotel. The hotel also offers a great little breakfast in the morning.

<Content>Great location I stayed at the Omega Hotel for three nights. Just back yesterday. It is in a great location very close to the Museumplein (less than 10 mins). Tram into city centre to Centraal Station very close also (2-3 mins). I (female) travelled by myself and for the most part felt safe. The only thing I felt odd about the whole time I was in Amsterdam was that outside my bedroom window was a little ledge (like a balcony, but not a balcony) and also off this was a window into a room next door. I don't know if the other window belonged to a bedroom or some sort of service room but had I left my window open someone could have come from the room next door into mine. Amsterdam is experiencing a heatwave at the moment and without AC, even with the window open, it was incredibly hot and sticky in the room. My room had two beds and on the final night I changed beds in the middle of the night so sticky was it. Room was very small and would have been uncomfortable had someone been travelling with me. That said, it was clean and for the amount of time I spent in it, was fine. It cost me 65 per night but some websites were charging more. Ensuite was provided; fridge and safe in the room; breakfast included (although this seems to depend on the website you book through). Breakfast was fine - the usual fruit, cereal, bread, coffee etc and fry (although there never seemed to be any bacon). Traffic noise was non-existent at night as it is on quite a residential street. However, there is a church on the street whose clock sounds on the hour and half-hour (maybe all night?? It never actually woke me up but it would probably seriously annoy a light sleeper). There is a small but nice garden area off the bar for drinks in the evening. Encountered two receptionists - one grumpy, one nice. I don't ask for much but he could have said welcome to Amsterdam or hope you enjoyed your stay with us etc. There's a 鈧? charge for paying by credit card. Would stay there again. Loved Amsterdam. Top tips: (1) buy your tickets for the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum on the web before you go. Queues are hideous. I didn't go into the Anne Frank house but walked by mid-afternoon and the queue was really long (2) wear sensible shoes - trainers etc. Mine are in bits having spent a few days in flip flops. It is a great city for walking as it's so flat (3) get out of Amsterdam and go see Haarlem (4) if the weather is good go to the beach at Zaandvort. It's on the same line as Haarlem and Amsterdam-Zaandvort is only about 30 mins. Trains from Centraal Station are so frequent you don't need to bother getting a timetable beforehand (5) Most importantly, don't walk in the cycle lane. They will run you down.

<Content>nice stay As a single woman I was looking for a place that was safe, clean, and quiet. Omega Hotel was all of these. My single room was tiny, but adequate. The bathroom was large and clean, shower worked well. I had a quiet room facing a courtyard and was not bothered by the church bells. The location is good, easy walk to the museums, grocery, and tramlines. Only issue was with the phone, you must give a 20 euro deposit to use the phone. I did not eat breakfast (an extra charge), but the room has a small refrigerator I stocked with snacks and drinks. I would recommend it for someone not interested in being in the center of the nightlife.

<Content>A Very Nice Hotel This is a great little hotel if you want to be slightly away from the madness of the Leidesplein! Very near to the museums (Van Gogh, Reijksmuseum), it is located in a very pleasant part of Amsterdam. Admittedly the guy on reception was a little surly when we checked in however our twin room (we had booked a double, must be a European thing) was very comfortable and clean, the TV and hairdryer worked and the shower was excellent! There is also a little fridge, very handy. One downside is the church opposite that chimes on the hour and half-hour - after two nights I found the chimes quite comforting!We did not have breakfast whilst we were there (10 euros), but it looked your typical continental fare - ham, cheese, rolls, coffee etc. I went downstairs to the breakfast room/bar on the Sunday morning and asked if I could take coffee and juice back to our room - the lady that was serving didn't want any money for the drinks, and she seemed quite concerned that my husband and I didn't want anything to eat - so she gave us some of those little caramel biscuits you always get with coffee in Amsterdam. Nice touch!All in all I thought this hotel was excellent value for money and I would have no hestitation in booking here again.

<Content>Awful Chose this hotel based on previous reviews.If you plan on not sleeping and are able toreally rough it, this hotel will do... otherwisestay somewhere else.Location is convenient for catching tram intotown. Note that you have to pay up front for the room on arrival, so you may want to checkroom beforehand. Owner finally agreed breakfast was included, although in the end i didn't bother, due to cleaniness...My room was dusty and tiny, even for a single.Bathroom at least was clean with hot water.There's a church nearby, whose bell rings on the hour every hour, even in the wee hours of morning. If you plan to go in next few months and it'snot a bank holiday, note that there are building works going on next door and builders start banging/drilling at 7.30am.

<Content>Fit the Bill in Museum Area We are a retired couple and visited the Omega for five nights starting the 13th of Jan.2005. We are especially pleased with two things about the hotel:1. They accepted our small two Bichon dogs and put us in a ground floor room where we could let them out on the terrace (not likely during the summer months, though).2. The hotel is one block from a wonderful tram line stop Jacob Obersgraat, line 2 to Central Station. There is 1 stop to the Van Gogh Museum and 2 stops to the Rijksmuseum.Our room was small, has cable TV, a safe, an empty mini-bar where we kept some drinks. There is a small shower and adequate space for toiletries in the bathroom. The hairdryer is connected to the dresser drawer but there is no mirror near that spot. I warn Americans that suitcases can be a liability: travel light or stay in a larger hotel. The Omega has no internet connections in the rooms but for one euro per hr.you can use a desktop computer in the lobby. The PC has an English language keyboard. It works fitfully, but we did manage to get our email. There are only a few restaurants within walking distance but other shops existed: for example a tabac where the strippen karte ten-ride tram cards were sold. The best row of restaurants are along the st. facing the Concertgebouw only three blocks away. The Leidseplan (third stop from the hotel)has a plethora of eateries lining the sts. and is a center of activity in the evening.The staff friendliness and service were uneven--some clerks bent over backward, others were indifferent: the staff seemed to enjoy their work, performed any task asked of them, and refused tips. However, they were not terribly well informed about specific tourist questions (for example I asked one of the desk guys where I should go to see a major dept. store and he didn't really know). Breakfast was the usual: muesli to cheerios, breads, jams, butter, etc. A bowl of fruit cocktail was set out daily. Breakfast, served to 10 30am, included a hot section with ghastly scrambled eggs but good bacon and sausage. A limited selection of lunch meats and cheese slices rounded out the fare. Coffee, tea, hot choc. plentiful.Access (a concern to me) to the main reception was down four steps with a railing. Reception and breakfast rooms were a half story underground. The hotel is in a standard brick Amsterdam house. In the main building there is an elevator to the upper floors. Note that there is another attached house with hotel rooms: I did not notice if there was an elevator on that side, but the steps were a bit difficult to negotiate: I would not want to carry suitcases up the stairs on the far side of the DR.I advise that you mention mobility problems when booking.I would definately stay again except that the owner is concerned about keeping dogs (the maid was afraid of the dogs so we had no room cleanings).

<Content>Not the same hotel I remembered I have stayed at this hotel on and off for about fifteen years or more, back when it was a 2 star small run and basic hotel. Since it was refurbished, extended and upgraded a few years ago, I feel it has also gained (unfortunately) the same attitudes and airs that hotels of higher stars seem to have. I recall in the 2 star days that the staff were so friendly and always remembered me and my late wife, but now, while still courteous (as all Dutch people are), there wasnt the same friendliness.The price for rooms also shot up greatly and I dont feel that there is the small value for money, given its location.I would say that the hotel was more 3 star than 4, and that you could find better value elsewhere, but one of the attractions is the sheer quirkiness of the place.

<Content>Great location and good atmoshphere We spent 3 nights in September at the Omega. We arrived late and were greeted really graciously by Sophie, who forewarned us about the church bells. They did not bother us in the least. We had a large room on a low floor. The room had air conditioning which was absolutely terrific since it was 33C outdoors. (Our only complaint is that the fridge was not cleaned out, it may have been missed.) There was a lovely garden and we were invited to tea or coffee the entire stay. The front desk people were exceptionally helpful and printed out train and other schedules for us.The hotel is in a residential area and quite central. Wonderful Vondelpark is a 2 minute walk away and the Van Gogh museum is 5 minutes away. It was quite a difference staying in a quiet area as opposed to a larger hotel near all the action in the center. The 2 tram is a 5 minute ride from Leidesplein.We would definitely recommend this hotel and go back there again.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, good location. Celebrated my 50th birthday in Amsterdam and, overall, my wife and I were quite happy with this hotel.We arrived very late (after midnight) but there was no problem checking in. The room was small but very clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. The bathroom (shower but no bath) was clean and well looked after each day. The buffet breakfast didn't have a massive choice but was OK.The hotel is in a quiet area so the only noise we heard at night was the nearby church clock which chimes every half hour. Only a few minutes walk from the No.2 tram stop, it is within walking distance of the city centre. There are a couple of small bar/restaurants nearby which is handy.The staff are OK but there were few smiles. We got the extra towels we had to ask for but not the extra pillows.If you're looking for somewhere clean, comfortable and quiet, in a good location, at a reasonable price, then this is the one for you. We would go back again.

<Content>Good location We stayed in this hotel for three nights last month. Hotel is in a good location, just minutes away from van gogh museum and the leidseplein, and on a quiet residential street. Good base for sightseeing. Room was clean and a good size with a balcony, mini-bar was empty though. Can't understand other peoples reviews regarding the staff at this hotel though. Any time we approached them they were acting as though we were bothering them and interupting there tv viewing. They never said hello when you entered reception and i never saw a smile once. We asked at the reception to have some drinks at the bar one evening (reception staff also cover the small bar) and we felt we were really hassling him as he was obviously very busy (watching tv in back room at reception!). If it wasn't for the attitudes of staff i would recommend this hotel.

<Content>An odd little hotel I wish I could give this hotel 3 and 1/2 stars, because I think 4 is just a little too much for it. It has some very good points - it is very accessible via the 2 or 16 trams from Centraal Station, and bus. It's near enough to Amsterdam city centre to be easily travelled, but far enough away to give you a chance to escape the hustle and bustle. It is located in a quiet residential area, yet is close to the Museumplein. It's also very close to the local (underground!) Albert Heijn supermarket so you can pick up soft drinks, sandwiches etc to avoid playing hotel prices. The room was clean and comfortable as was the bathroom.Now for the bad points - the reception staff were very dour and unwelcoming. Housekeeping seemed dodgy at best. One day they left no new toilet paper in my room (despite there only being a little left on the roll) - when I went to reception and asked for more, it was played out like it was a major imposition on their time with a lot of tutting and list checking! Another day, I returned to the hotel and found Housekeeping had left my room door open when they finished cleaning the room! Thankfully nothing was taken, but I was annoyed.All in all, it's a reasonable hotel if you just want basic accomodation. However, I would not expect too much from it either. Location wise it can't be beat - service wise though, it can. Would have hoped for better from a Ramada!

<Content>Great!! Stayed for 2 nights, The rooms were lovely, clean and well kept. Staff were very accomodating. The location is ideal for a short break in the city. 5 min walk from the rail station, and great for expolring.From experience I'd say its worth paying the extra to stay in a 3* rather than 2* in Amsterdam!!

<Content>Excellent Moderate Hotel My son and I stayed at the hotel for four nights, January 28 through January 31, 2005, and found the hotel to be excellent, recognizing that it is a moderate class hotel.Without exception, the staff was pleasant and eager to please. All of them spoke english fluently, to my embarrasment as I can only speak english. Without exception, they outdid themselves to be of assistance.The rooms, my son and I had separate rooms, were spotless and in good order. They were not worn. They were pleasant and of good size, above similar US standards. Much more than one would expect in a moderately priced hotel.The hotel is in a fine location, similar to Boston's Back Bay section. There are two tram lines within two and three blocks, respectively, of the hotel.Both my son and my wife want to visit Amsterdam this May; we will stay at this hotel.
