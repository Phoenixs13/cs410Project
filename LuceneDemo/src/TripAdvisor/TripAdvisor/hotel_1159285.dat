<Content>GREAT new hotel in Boston I'm a frequent business traveler but was in Boston over Thanksgiving to see family and I didn't want to stay in a big hotel like I would normally do. The Inn was exactly what I was looking for! First, the location is amazing- pretty much in the center of Boston (but on a quiet residential street) within walking distance of the Prudential, Copley, the south end, Boston common, Fanuiel hall- you name it. The building itself is a beautiful old brownstone (you would never know it was a hotel if it weren't for the small sign by the door). Parking at the Pru was about 1.5 blocks away. The european style check-in (no front desk, just a code to punch in at the front door) was incredibly convenient- no waiting in lines in the lobby, no having to deal with hotel staff- we just went straight up to our room. The interior is beautifully decorated- the halls, the rooms, the bathrooms- all of it is done very tastefully and artfully. The bed was very comfortable, the sheets were high thread count, and I appreciated the selection of pillows (I hate when hotels don't provide you with a few options). I loved the large windows overlooking the street (and the fact that I could black them out at night). I stayed in the 1 bedroom suite and it was very spacious and well equipped (bathrobe, flat screen tv- the kitchenette even had champagne glasses). The shower was wonderful. In the morning we went down to the continental breakfast (good coffee selection) where I talked to one of the hotel employees, Mike, who was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the city and was able to give me a several suggestions for places to eat and sites to see while I was in town.Overall, I had a great stay- I will definitely be coming back to the Inn on future trips, both personal and business.

<Content>Overall, a Very Good Experience We stayed for 5 nights at The Inn at St. Botolph. Overall, it was a great experience. We booked a 1-bedroom suite (kitchenette, living room, bedroom, bathroom), and it was an adequate size for ourselves and our 6-year old son. There was plenty of closet storage as well. The many windows made it bright during the day, but the room-darkening curtains made it sufficiently dark for sleeping.The staff were consistently polite and helpful, and were immediately responsive to any of our needs. They even called us back when we tried to call them but got no answer--even though we didn't leave a message! Our room was very quiet, and we couldn't hear the elevator, which was right next to our room. The location couldn't be better (5-10 minutes to everything), and overnight parking was only 1-1/2 blocks away, at the Prudential Center parking garage. There are a few things to take into consideration if you're planning to stay as a family with younger children at the Inn at St. Botolph. First, the kitchenette is not completely family-friendly. For example, it was stocked with 12 or so champagne and wine glasses, but there was not a cereal bowl to be found. The plastic drinking glasses were so huge that they were unmanageable for smaller hands, and there was no trash can for kitchen trash. But the nearly full-size refrigerator/ freezer (with auto ice maker) was a tremendous asset, as were the toaster oven and two-burner stove top. The black rubber floor in the kitchenette and bathroom was probably not a great choice for a hotel room--they looked dirty, even when cleaned.As for sleeping arrangements, the Inn provided an Aerobed for our son at our request, but the bedroom was too small to accommodate it (also, the queen bed canopy-type frame was also way too big for such a small room, and made it difficult to move around in the room--a lower headboard/footboard configuration would have been more appropriate). Putting the Aerobed in the living room was impractical, given our varied sleep schedules.Finally, to be fully family-friendly, a bathtub instead of just a shower stall would have been helpful. The bathroom was clean and nicely arranged, and there was plenty of room on both sides of the sink to put our belongings. The towels and comfy bathrobe were of obviously high quality.We will definitely stay at the Inn at St. Botolph's again, and would recommend the hotel to others. But be aware that their cancellation policy dictates no refund if you cancel less than two weeks in advance, and it will cost you $50 if you cancel earlier than that.

<Content>One Word - IMPRESSIVE!!! I鈥檝e stayed at many different hotels in the past yet I鈥檝e never cared enough to write a review for any of them. The Inn @ St. Botolph has wow鈥檈d me beyond belief 鈥?I鈥檓 not exaggerating!!My fianc茅 and I were in town visiting family during Thanksgiving 鈥?Because we were surprising my folks we searched the web instead of asking for a recommendation. We weren鈥檛 sure what to expect, but we sure were happy when we arrived鈥?br/>The hotel is a beautiful brownstone on the corner of St Botolph Street near the Prudential Center T stop and garage. GPS brought us right to the door, but the brick building didn鈥檛 look like a typical hotel. We typed our access code and entered the hotel (we were exhausted and it was nice not having to 鈥渃heck-in鈥?. Immediately we knew the place was special. The walls were nicely painted in a sophisticated and welcoming hue of brown (which happens to be my favorite color). We found our room (#304) without a hitch. It was a studio - a surprisingly sizable one! My favorite decorations include the round ceiling fixture, the oversized wood blinds and drapery (so we could 鈥渂lack out鈥?and sleep in), huge LG TV and full body mirror. The mirror for some reason made me look 15 pounds heavier though?? Anyways, we slept like a rock even though it wasn鈥檛 鈥渙ur鈥?bed鈥?oh, and the shower was just amazing!! It came down like a rain fall鈥?We woke up just before check out time and fortunately had time to go to the lounge. My partner had smoked tea and I had espresso. I have to say, as a coffee lover, I was more than pleased to find they had terrific coffee!! Not the drip kind you usually find, but real European flavor鈥?At breakfast we chatted with one of the hotel employees, Brendan, who was extremely friendly, not what I expected of someone working on a holiday!We totally got a steal (admittedly without expecting it). The value for my money was so well spent! The Inn has it all: great rooms, beeeautiful decorations, fantastic location with a staff that makes you feel at home. It was absolutely one of the most comfortable places I've ever stayed at. I really hope they don鈥檛 raise their prices 'cause we will DEFINITELY be back!

<Content>My new haven....really don't want to share it!!! My husband, two young boys, and I stayed at the Inn at St. Botolph on it's opening weekend October 10th through 14th. We booked the penthouse suite for an incredible deal. The room had a very large master bedroom with a queen, a huge living room with sectional sofa, desk, and fireplace, and a smaller 'turret' room with a twin trundle bed for the kids. The suite also had a fully appointed kitchen and a very nice bathroom. Each room had its own flat screen tv! The furnishings were lovely; a kind of a subdued contemporary feel.This hotel offers a very quiet, luxurious retreat. A place for those not looking for a grandiose lobby, concierge, or room service. There is, however, daily maid service, a small workout room, and a guest lobby that offers continental breakfast every morning.We were a little nervous to be staying at the hotel on opening weekend. Understandably, there were a few small things that weren't quite ready, but nothing that is important enough to report. Ryan, the manager, was WONDERFUL! He obviously had been working tirelessly to get the hotel ready and was eager to make our stay comfortable. I have been to Boston many times and have stayed in hotels throughout the city including the Four Seasons, The Eliot, The Collonade, and others, but the Inn at St. Botolph fills all the requirements I have for a hotel. It is quiet (very important to me), the rooms are large and well appointed, it is centrally located, it is a great value, and it still retains a small intimate feel.We will be back!
