<Content>Hotel Metropol was certainly adequate! Hotel Metropol is not for honeymooners. The walls are paper thin but the accommodations are just fine. It is certainly a good bang for the buck. The hotel lobby is lovely, offering a lot of local marble and artwork. There are two elevators that service the 160 rooms, but they are TINY. Three of us with a suitcase each was too much!The rooms provided us with a king size bed, a beautifully large bathroom (GREAT WATER PRESSURE) and good lighting. There was NO airconditioning, and that was a little disturbing considering it was in the high 80's during the day and the high 70's at night.The restaurant was good, but not great. The food was simple, but they tried to make it elegant. The prices weren't bad, but the quality wasn't great. The breakfast buffet was a nice treat, (included with our room fee). The coffee was some of the best I've ever had in my life, and as a traveler through much of South and Central America, I know my coffee!!!!The staff was incredible. Very nice, they spoke a good broken english, and were always willing to smile and giggle! The hotel isn't on a great street, but one block up, one block down, you're in the heart of it all.

<Content>Excellent Service, Central Location We stayed at the Metropol for four days in April. The service and staff were absolutely excellent providing good advice on resturants, tour companies and more. They changed our room from interior to exterior (the front street was quiet) quite happily when we changed our mind. The hotel is located just two blocks from the very lovely and green Allemeda park and a 15 minute walk from the Zocalo. The hotel does not have air conditioning, so I could not say if it would be uncomfortable in the summer. A high quality tourist hotel!

<Content>Metropol a great hotel, friendly service Stayed here for four days. It was very hot and they put a fan in our room without us asking. Gave us key cards willingly when we lost ours. Very friendly to us, great service.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Great travel office in hotel, GOOD prices We stayed at the Hotel Metropol in Mexico City. DF on the address is District Federal which you may see on many Mexico City addresses. The Hotel is verfy central and within walking distance of the main Zocoro (city center). The subway in Mexico City is only 20 cents ! which is 2 pesos, so don't be afraid to use it. Information in the subway has colorful maps. Wonderful Museums in the city especially at Chapultapec Park. Don't miss the Restaurant Havanna. Good food and great coffee. The Hotel Metropol has a full buffet breakfast, which is about $6 but worth it. Safe in the room, but you have to pay a deposit at the desk to get the key lock, and the money is returned at checkout.

<Content>Hotel Metropol was great! The Hotel Metropol was a great place to stay. Next time I am in Mexico city I plan to stay there again. Good for business travelers and people who are vaguely familiar with Mexico city. NOT good for students traveling alone as it is not near many eateries, stores etc. - is two subway (Metro) stops from the Zona Rosa, but is within 2 blocks walking distance to a subway station.Hovever, the service is great and the restaurant serves good food. The bar is ok - only one bartender - not many varieties, and imported liquor is very expensive as with all places in Mexico.Only a 5 block walk to the Palacio de Bellas Artes and a $20ish taxi ride from the bus station.I'd say it deserves 3 stars.

<Content>Metropol 2nd Home A very good average hotel. Our group had a nice block of rooms. The restaurant service was excellent. I only wished the rooms would have been airconditioned.
