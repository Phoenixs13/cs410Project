<Content>Nice choice I've been to this hotel twice in less than a month. I stayed for 4 nights each time but on my next trip I'll probably change.I have nothing against this hotel, I just want to try something else so I can compare properly.I'll probably edit this post once i return to Mexico but the for the time beeing let me quickly describe my experience.The rooms are very large and if you get a high exterior room you'll have a great view over the city (ask for the back side of the hotel, more quiet and better view). The bed was very big and comfortable and I had everything I needed: big desk, arm chair etc... The bathrom did seem a little old but it was functional enough.I dinned at the Naranjo's several times and it was worth it. Most of the employees were very pleasent (specially the maids) but the front desk people not so much.One thing that made my stay very positive was the all around wifi connection. I travel with my laptop all the time and it was great to use the internet even during breakfast.As I said, it is a nice hotel, but before I give my final opinion I'd like to compare it with another 5 star hotel in Mexico D.F.

<Content>One of the best hotels for the price!! Very nice hotel, wonderful amenities. Here is my review:Positives:- Pool in the pent house, very nice view of the city from the top of the hotel- Travel agency in the hotel were very friendly, they have a lot of different tours to choose from- Lounge area by the restaurant where you have a piano player, a nice place to relax- Rooms are extra clean, the furniture looks very attractive and nicely chosen- Bell boys service was good.- Staff and waiters at the restaurant were very friendly and provided very nice service.- Location, it was safe for me to walk in the streets around the hotel even during the nightNegatives:1. Noise, if you are in a room in the center of the hotel atrium, expect to hear the piano playing until 11:00 PM while in your room. Worse, if there is a party going on in one of their dancing halls, it may continue to 3:00 AM in the morning. Therefore, make sure to ask for a room as far away from the noise as possible if you want to get some sleep.2. Internet charges: They charge you by time intervals, 12 hours (92 pesos )or 24 hours (138 pesos). I thought this was inconvenient for a long stay, it would be nice if they charge one flat rate for the stay or provide the internet for free like other hotels in Mexico city. Sometimes you can negotiate to get 24 hours for the price of 12Other tips:- The Taxis standing by the hotel are super expensive. You can stop a green beetle taxi or a white and red taxi for your ride instead and save up to 80% of the price. However, be careful and make sure the meter in the taxis are working.- There is a nice taco restaurant I liked very much by the hotel, it is called El-Caminero. It was not very expensive (around 80 pesos for dinner including a drink). The food tasted extremely delicious!! When you exit the hotel main door, make a left then walk until you reach the first side street, make a left again and walk around 300 M, the Restaurant will be on your left.

<Content>Overall a good stay at the Sevilla Palace Overall our stay was good. Room was a good size and in good condition. The view from the room was great too. It faced the main boulevard (Reforma) and had a great view of the city. The hotel is not in a touristry area, but was was very centralized and the area felt VERY safe to walk around in (even at night). Bellboy and concierge service was excellent. They were always very friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast in the restaurant was great...and so was the service. Our waiter Antonio was so sweet and attentive. Front desk service was not as great. It wasn't BAD, but wasn't GREAT either. The person that helped us at check-in was at the front desk pretty much all throughout our stay there. She wasn't flat out rude or anything, but she wasnt very helpful either. Her affect was typically flat and sometimes she seemed annoyed when we asked her a question. We also had a problem with the breakfast vouchers. Breakfast was supposed to be included free with our stay (as per our on-line reservation), however we did not recieve vouchers at check-in and then were denied the vouchers when we inquired and were told that breakfast was not included...with no further explanation. (We chose not to argue about it because we did not have the reservation print out to verfy it).The room's AC was also very loud, so we just decided to turn it off when we went to bed. One tip about taxis: When the bellboy/concierge staff see you walking out, they will typically ask you whether you want a cab and will call one for you. The cabs they call are VERY expensive as compared to the ones you can hail on the street. We were charged $100.00 pesos by the hotel taxi to go from the hotel to the Palacio Bellas Artes,. However on our way back, we hailed a red  white taxi from the street which charged us $20.00 pesos for the same route. When we figured out this major difference in price, we decided to take red  white taxis only during our stay in Mexico City and had very good experience with them (even considering that we were all females). The red  whites can be hailed right from in front of the hotel as well. Some have meters and some don't. If they don't, ask for the price before you get in.

<Content>A good value I stayed in this hotel twice while on business in the spring of 2005. I found the hotel to be a good value for the money, at least in Mexico City terms. It has pretty good amenities--a pool, small gym, and business center which are rare in hotels in this price category. I was pleasantly surprised by the cheaper of its two restaurants Naranjos. The food was quite good--a nice blend of traditional Mexican and international. A good value for the price. I ate at the more expensive restaurant one night and paid a lot more for food that wasn't really all that good. The staff are helpful and friendly, and the rooms are very clean as someone else pointed out.However, the hotel has 4 negative points that ultimately have led me not to return.1) Internet is only available in the rooms on the courtyard side of the hotel. This side of the building has virtually no natural sunlight reaching the rooms.2) Rooms on the street side are very noisy. Reforma is a MAJOR avenue with very bad traffic jams. (Of course, you get a bird's eye view of all protests, which can be interesting).3) Even the rooms on the street side are very dark, and frankly depressing.4) The entrances to all the rooms are on a central atrium. This is an interesting architectual feature and quite attractive (in a 1960s/70s kind-of way), but it's not such a good arrangement if you are a single woman. You can see what room anyone goes into from pretty much any point in the atrium, including the restaurant. So, I felt a bit vulnerable.Overall, it's a good choice for people on a budget. Like so many hotels in the center it was built during an unfortunate period for architecture and style, so the rooms and furniture are funky colors and a little awkward. But, that's not their fault. They do a good job with what they have.

<Content>Very nice hotel This is a nice hotel geared towards business travelers. My partner and I (a lesbian couple) stayed there as tourists and we were pleased with how quite and nice the hotel is, and we got a great internet rate of about $75/night. The rooms are large and have a sitting area in addition to the bed and bathroom. Our room was quite dark, even with all the lights on and curtains open. It overlooked a dark courtyard so that didn't help. I'd recommend getting a room looking outside the building if possible. The gym is very well equiped for a hotel, even has a punching bag. And the restaurant (Naranjos) is good and reasonably priced (though much cheaper food can be found elsewhere in the city). If you're looking for tourist information, don't expect too much from the hotel, it doesn't seem to devote much attention to that. And I speak spanish so I can't attest to their english speaking abilitites. The hotel is a nice walk to the Zocalo and the Zona Rosa (it is inbetween the two) right on a main street.A few other tips: don't use the private cabs just outside the hotel door (that the door men will offer you). Their rates are much higher than the green and white ones you can flag down on the streets. We enjoyed the touribus tour of the city (which stops right near the hotel).

<Content>Sevilla Palace Hotel in Mexico City Stayed here last year and was very impressed. For the price and quality, it cannot be beat. it's a business hotel so there's not a lot of tourists or a tourist focus (which suits me just fine) but the nice thing about business hotels is that they like to keep everything clean. Which in Mexico is really damn important. The restaurant is OK, the pool is halfway decent, worth a swim if there isnt anyone else around. I'll be staying here again on my next trip.

<Content>Overall a great experience Stayed at Sevilla Palace over the course of four nights. Seems to be a mostly business-oriented hotel, but for tourism purposes was great, too. The glass elevators in the 23 or 24 story hotel were beautiful. Staff is helpful and it isn't hard to find someone who can speak English. (Although they are very encouraging when one tries to speak Spanish.)It's located smack downtown, near the intersection of Reforma and Insurgentes, the two main roads that divide the city N-S and E-W. It's a pleasant walk to the presidential palace and main cathedral. It's also close to the fun zona rosa, with many restaurants and shops.The food is fantastic at this hotel. The breakfast buffet is well worth getting up for and includes both Mexican and American fare. (Cactus juice is a surprise!)There are a couple of bars/lounges, which are comfortable and often have life performers singing in Spanish.The pool/jacuzzi is on the rooftop and, while small, provides a great view of this vast city.The rooms are nice, include TV, marble bathroom. The only complaint is the bed was hard.
