<Content>Comfortable  I can see how one could have a high quality stay here, but our stay was far from exceptional. As per the other reviews, the positives are:- clean, comfortable rooms with double windows you can open- friendly, helpful staff- good quality restaurant in the building- in a fun, seemingly safe areaThe negatives are:- no a/c (a problem if streetside)- on a very busy street (requiring choice between hot or noisy room)Also, the weekend we stayed had a local festival in the street on one evening, which we didn't know about and the hotel didn't let us know at all - we arrived back from a long day's cycling and walking to find a street party (loads of drunk folk, broken bottles and thunderous dance music) which wouldn't have been a problem if it wasn't such a surprise and we could have planned for it!

<Content>Loved the Riehmers Hofgarten!! My daughter and I spent 5 nights here at the end of June, and had a wonderful time. The manager of the hotel, Herr Andreas Krause, was so welcoming and helpful with directions, suggestions, fixing my daughter's cell phone, etc, etc. The hotel has recently renovated an apartment which we moved into our 2nd night(180 euros) which was fabulous-- felt like we had a really cool apartment in Berlin! The rooms are huge, quiet and sunny.It is in a beautiful old restored courtyard and was well worth the extra expense. We had started off in a room facing the street which was lovely, except with the windows open, it was noisier than I would like. (The courtyard rooms were booked for World Cup.) The street-facing rooms are fine if you have earplugs or keep the windows closed, but the courtyard rooms are my first choice.We had dinner several times at e.t.a. hoffmann, the restaurant in the hotel. The food was delicious and interesting, and the ambience was delightful-- very relaxing and the three young servers are all so nice. It started to feel very homey!The neighborhood in Kreuzberg is great; not touristy. We loved the area and felt very safe and comfortable. It is a short walk from the hotel to the Mehringdamm u-bahn stop which will take you anywhere. There is a nice park, Victoriapark, nearby and good restaurants within walking distance. The things we liked most were the friendliness and kindness of the people working there, and the fact that the hotel seemed to have Europeans, including Germans, staying there. We didn't hear a lot of English spoken, except for me! The staff speaks English and everyone was nice about it. I highly recommend the Riehmers Hofgarten if you would like a friendly, non-touristy place where you will feel at home.

<Content>Most ideal hotel My husband and I stayed at the Riehmers Hofgarten in November for three nights and had a most enjoyable time. The room was huge, stylish and comfortable. The service was exceptional. The front desk staff was most helpful in planning our itinerary. The restaurant, very classy, serves excellent cuisine. As for the hotel's location, it's perfect - 8 min walk to the underground station, and in the middle of all the sightseeing, such as the Brandenburg Gate, Potsdamerplatz, the shopping thoroughfare Kurf眉rstendamm, Checkpoint Charlie and the Jewish Museum. There is a Catholic church right beside the hotel. The room rate is most reasonble - 138 Euro a night, considering it's Berlin. We would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Charming Place to Stay in Berlin My husband and I enjoyed the discreet, apartment-style vibe of this place with a small courtyard, smack in a fashionable neighborhood in Berlin. The restaurant was good, though the service was a bit slow (even by European standards). Everything was readily accessible to us from this hotel even though we didn't have a car. Would stay there again.
