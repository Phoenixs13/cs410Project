<Content>modern design hotel services can improve The hotel has been redesigned, and is looking a lot more modern. I had stayed here before. What was disappointing was the restaurant : quality and service are good, but I was all alone in the restaurant. Eating alone is one thing, eating alone in an empty restaurant is worse.TV : no pay TV so only movies in spanish and the usual CNN stuff, I expect a modern hotel to have better facilities for TV.

<Content>Nice Rooms but Staff Stole Went to Barcelona last Feb/March and the room was clean, if not a little small and we loved the neighborhood. Great small bars throughout the neighborhood that were very friendly, helpful and hospitable. Breakfast was a little spendy but acceptable. Only thing that took away from an above average rating was someone (probably housekeeping) stole 3 shirts from my wife's open suitcase. Which we discovered as we were packing to leave at 4 am and we told mgmt about our missing shirts and they said MAYBE we missed them when packing (didn't because we went thru the room with a find-tooth comb) and then they said maybe we packed them and forgot about it or overlooked it (checked when we got home and NO they were missing). Mgmt did nothing about it after we returned to the States. Very disappointing BUT I loved the city and would tell everyone who has a chance, to please visit!!!

<Content>Great Hotel! I have just come back from a 3 night stay at the NH Numancia, I found the hotel to be excellent, it was clean, modern and I found the location to be great.The hotel itself is a five minute walk from the Sants Estacio Metro station, the metrol station is on the green line and I found that most of the tourist attractions are on this line so you are pretty much central to everything. It is also only a 15 minute walk away from the Nou Camp. By staying at this hotel you are not in the hustle and bustle and for me personally I found this a good thing. The area surrounding the hotel is very nice and clean and quiet. There is also a supermarket just across the road which is always helpful.The room was very modern and clean and had everything that you needed. We did not have a view from our window however that did not bother me as you are only really there to sleep!My only concern about the hotel is the restaurant, my boyfriend and I chose to eat there one night as we were feeling pretty tired! Having looked at the menu we thought that due to the types of dishes that were availiable we felt that the food would be up to a high standard. The food was awful!!!! We both ordered the lamb, it was stone cold and when we did complain the waitress did not seem to care or be concerned, I think this was due to the language barrier. It was definitely not worth the 60 Euros that we spent on it!Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is very clean and modern and the location is ideal.

<Content>New and clean, reasonable location Nice room, recently redone. Location is only a few blocks from the centrally located Sants Estacio metro station. Safe-feeling neighborhood. Walls thin - can hear noise from neighboors but this was not too much of a problem. Reasonable staff. Safe in room was nice to find. Breakfast adequate but pricey. Would recommend.

<Content>Wonderful Staff.. Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel and could not have been happier with the service we received.We arrived on Saturday lunchtime and the young man on reception was so helpful and obviously proud of the City.Location was perfect for us as we were there to watch Barca play and it is only a fifteen minute walk to Camp Nou.Breakfast was lovely with a very good selection.Would stay at this hotel again without hesitation.

<Content>Very nice Just came back from a stay of two nights and it was wondeful. the hotel room was exceptionally clean and nicely decorated. in the lobby every morning there was a display of various newspapers including one in english and the location is great if you need to be near sans train station as you are able to walk..about 10 minutes. as far as location with respect to the city center, it is rather far....a good hour plus walking but the metro is close enough.also, directly in front of the hotel is a small convience store to pick up water,etc and next door a very good typical spanish rest. with resonable prices.for me, the only thing missing was a swimming pool as Barcelona can be hot!

<Content>good location, beautiful hotel, but noisy stay the Pla莽a del centre metro station on is just a block or so away and that's just a few stops from the centre; the hotel is - if you like modern design - really beautiful for it's price category, especially the buffet room (expect to pay an extra for a breakfast) is very different from the usual old fashioned dining rooms with a kitsch deco; the staff is friendly and helpfull; our only complaint is the noise, this hotel is located on a busy city road with buses, so I would'n advise a room on the lower front side if you're a light sleeper, despite the double glazing and the window shutters; in addition the hotel has hard floors everywhere instead of the usual hotel carpet, and the wall isolation doesn't sound like it's very thick, so although you're allowed to get your breakfast up to 11am, we didn't have a long sleep with all the noise around

<Content>Great experience Yes to echo other positive reviews here, NH was a very pleasant surprise. Booked through virginvacations.com. Business hotel in safe if bland business neighorhood, but yes conveniently a very short walk (perhaps 3 blocks) from the nearest underground entrance to the metro station, which does connect to the Barcelona Sants train station. Using the T10 card, you can get around to the touristy areas quickly and easily. Proximity to train stations convenient for day trips to Dali museum in Figueres (from Sants station) and Montserrat (from Placa Espana). Other than that, if you walk north from the hotel, you'll hit more business district, wide boulevards, chich restaurants, not typically on tourist itineraries, but its there. The hotel itself is a great place to come home to after a full day of sightseeing. very clean and comfortable beds, furniture, bathroom with amenities my wife loved. There is a flatscreen TV with mostly spanish channels but a german channel or french channel and a couple english channels. clean zenlike lobby with helpful cleancut, polite, and professional front desk staff, eager to help providing maps, directions, sightseeing suggestions. the best hotel breakfast we had in our europe trip. and there is actually some differences in the offerings from day to day for variety. Great fresh fruit selections. one day there was amazing fruit cocktail in glasses, kiwi, pear, etc. very nice presentation. There is hot food but have to ask for eggs, bacon, omelette as its not well advertised, one day, we just happened to notice the offering on a little card on the table. Otherwise, nice selections of different cold meats and cheeses are laid out. Fresh juice so good, kiwi juice, grapefruit. Different flavored yogurts and drinkable yogurts. different boxed cereals. There are few delicious sweet pastries and breads. But for me best was the spanish classic breakfast: baguette with olive oil, tomato sauce, and cured ham. You can make this yourself or they prepare small bite sized ones for you too.overall very nice hotel that is part of a chain. There are other NH hotels in barcelona too, a couple of them have cafes with ties to the world's greatest chef Ferran Adria of El Bulli fame, who is from Barcelona suburb.

<Content>Outstanding Digs This hotel was part of a flight+hotel travel package offered by 鈥済o today鈥? Based on the very positive reviews on tripadvisor we chose the NH Numancia hotel as part of our travel package. We loved this hotel. The rooms were very clean with modern amenities, bed comfortable, quiet room, breakfasts were outstanding (!), the staff was friendly, and the hotel is very close to a metro station. The positive tripadvisor reviews were 鈥渟pot on鈥? and we greatly appreciate tripadvisor as a primary guide for choosing a hotel that made our Barcelona experience an excellent one.Kathy  Derrill, State College PA

<Content>Pleasantly surprised! My bestfriend and I stayed at NH Numancia Hotel from 11/11/06 - 11/14/06 as part of a package deal from go.com. We were kind of nervous at first since the hotel we stayed at in Madrid turned out to be an apartment and it was in a pretty dirty, sub-par section of the city. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the Numancia hotel. It was clean, the room smelled really nice, and the hotel had a contemporary decor. We arrived early and since our room wasn't ready yet, the bellboy took our luggage and we had lunch nearby. The hotel is centrally located, I would say in the business section, with lots of tapas bars and restaurants around. The Ramblas was a taxi ride away, around 7 euros. The taxi and bus stop were right across the hotel as well as the Metro. The hotel was also located within walking distance from El Corte Ingles (a big shopping chain in Spain) as well as another shopping complex and also some designer stores - a short 2-block walk. The buffet breakfast was fabulous and very filling! The bathroom amenities were great. The room was kept clean by the staff everyday ....spotless. They also provided some Smint mint and also a couple of chocolate squares on the nightstand. I would definitely recommend NH Numancia for the value, cleanliness, and the location. I wouldn't mind staying there again the next time I'm in Barcelona.

<Content>Bargain in Barcelona Very nice hotel, close to the the Metro, friendly staff, clean, and great breakfast. We stayed at the hotel as part of a last minute package. The Numancia was undergoing a major renovation but that did not interfere with our stay. I suspect after the hotel upgrade is complete, the room rates will rise significantly.

<Content>Fashion hotel, clean, neat, well refurbished We spent two days, from Friday to Sunday. It impressed us as soon as we arrived. It is clean, just refurbished. Considering the rate we didn't expect such a beautiful and well decorated hotel. It is well located just near by the subway (less than a km). The district is quiet and safe. It is good for a family or a business man. The staff are kind but a little cold (considering they're spanish!! ;).Barcelona is an incredible city. It is worth visiting it.RobertoGeorgia (Rome, Italy)

<Content>Great Value Just returned from a Saturday to Saturday stay booked through go-today. Chose the least expensive hotel option based on previous review here and viewing the choices on the website. To give some perspective, we are a married couple in our fifties who can afford to stay in a pricey hotel, but as our point in traveling is to see the country, not the room, we don't see the point in spending our money that way. Our package, including Air France flights from Boston (air supplement for weekend travel), hotel room, breakfast each morning, and travel insurance, was $1,976 for the two of us.The hotel is outside the touristy area of the city but very conveniently located near the Sants Estacio train and metro stations. Train right from the airport to Sants is covered by a metro card. We found it cost effective and convenient to buy a T-10, which is sharable and costs 6 Euros. It was very easy to find and walk to the hotel from the station and to catch the metro wherever we wanted to go. We liked being away from the noisy part of town when we wanted to sleep. The staff seemed very friendly and helpful, though we are very low maintenance in that regard.The room was decent sized, very clean and newly decorated. The beds were twins pushed together to form a king-sized sleeping area, a negative in our estimation since we prefer one bed. They were, however, firm and comfortable. The bathroom was large, clean, bright, and completely tiled. The shower had plenty of hot water and good pressure. Toiletries provided included very good shampoo, shower gel, lotion, and glycerin soap. There were also a very nice comb, shaver and little shave cream, toothbrush and little toothpaste. All of these were replaced daily if they were used at all, as were the package of Smints and the chocolates that were left each night. If you require the usual plastic shower cap, sewing kit, and hair conditioner, you should pack these. The hairdryer in the bathroom worked very well. TV in room, not much in English -- but we weren't there to watch TV.Breakfast was a very extensive buffet including breads and pastries, spreads including butter and a wide assortments of jams and pates, fresh fruit, dairy products such as yogurt, flan, soy-based versions, and some others unfamiliar to us, cereal, assorted meats and cheeses, little baguette sandwiches, coffee and tea, and the best orange juice we have ever tasted. We could also order, at no extra charge, eggs and bacon, omelettes, or french toast. Everything was good. All of that being said, the hotel is still undergoing renovations. We were not bothered at all by noise, but the entrance, lobby, and the sitting room leading to the elevators were obviously under construction and not very attractive. That first impression worried us until we saw our room and the breakfast area, which were lovely and complete. If you require a lounge area, you will be disappointed.Other tips. The lights in the room don't work until you insert your key card in a slot by the light switches just inside your room, marked by a light and easy to find once you know what to do. We also found that our key card didn't work twice during the week, we suspect because the construction work might have interrupted the electricity and cancelled it out. Minor annoyance that a quick trip to the desk fixed.We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great value, friendly staff Spent 6 nights here. Location: The cab driver knew exactly where it was even though it's not exactly near the La Rambla area. Can walk to railroad station and Espana Square. 3 minutes walk to L3 metro. The bus stop is right in front of the hotel. Close to some shopping and the supermarket. If you like to stay in the middle of the hustle and bustle and crowds don't stay here as you won't be able to walk all the time from the Gothic Quarter and La Rambla here, but if you are OK with the metro then this is very pleasant area.Excellent restaurant at moderate prices which we used a few times at night. Breakfast buffet had all to feed various travelers but nothing truly fancy. Room service claimed to close at midnight but we could not get it at 11pm. However, my feeling was if we went to the lobby we could still get food there. Reception booked an excellent flamenco show and had many kinds of maps. There were always 3-4 people at the reception desk and they were very willing to help with anything from the converter to car rental.Hotel is undergoing renovation right now to expand (April-May 2005) so expect noise at 8:30am during the week. Sat/Sun was quet.
