<Content>A class above other Mercure Hotels - Great Value, Loved it! I've stayed at the Mercure Berlin Tempelhof Airport several times over the past years with the latest visit being for the bargain price of only 鈧?5! At this kind of price it has to be one of the best value hotels I've ever stayed in. The rooms are exceptionally clean and in superb condition (mine even had a kitchenette!), the beds are large and very comfortable and the bathroom is spotlessly clean and of a good size.Worth noting if you're arriving with a car is it's free to park on the street 2 minutes walk away but failing that the hotel offers an underground garage for about 鈧?0 per night.You know what to expect when staying at a Mercure in Germany but this one is a cut above the others I've stayed at and will always be my first choice when staying in Berlin.

<Content>Overall ok, but... The overall experience of the hotel was positive. However, I must say that it is absolutely OUTRAGEOUS that a 4-star hotel (not a cheap one, mind you) charges you 17 EURO EXTRA for breakfast. I mean, please.... Even if they served lobster (which I very much doubt they do) I still think it is completely ridiculous. Therefore, although I liked the hotel as such, I will not stay there ever again.

<Content>LOVED IT! With 4 months of travelling and staying at MANY hotels, we thought this hotel was outstanding!Lovely staff, great location, AMAZING breakfast buffet ( have never seen anything like it!) and really CLEAN and comfortable room! We used the the restaurant many a night for dinner and it was A+ and the wait staff very helpful. We would totally recommend it and would stay there again should we be lucky enough to travel again in the future!

<Content>Where is my room? I booked several days in advance, prepaying the room on AmEx Axiom. When I arrived, I completed the registration, and then was advised that they acknowledged the reservation, but had no rooms. The desk clerk summoned the manager. The manager found another room at the Accor Suite Hotel, and explained that not only was it 8 euros cheaper, it was also closer to the ITB conference. I replied that I was not attending ITB, and my client was just south of Tempelhof (THF). She arranged a taxi, and claimed she provided a voucher to the alternate hotel, and a second voucher from the alternate hotel to my appointment. However, the next day I learned that the second voucher was actually only a part of the first, and paid the fare myself.

<Content>Disappointed Staff was professional but not friendly - seemed robotic when they welcomed me. Website states it has free continental breakfast, wireless and transportation to the airport. It has the breakfast but it didn't come with my room. When I asked about why the wireless wasn't working I was told that it's no longer included in the price. The phones didn't work either. I mentioned that their website still has the wireless listed as an amenity. No response. I asked about the free transportation to the airport and was told that would be no problem. I needed to check out at 3:30 AM to catch my flight. When the cab arrived the driver wanted cash. I told him it was supposed to be free. He insisted it wasn't and was going to drive off. I convinced him to wait while I went back in to check. The staff member at the front desk asked how much he wanted and I told them. They wrote a note in German (which I don't read) and told me to give it to the driver. The driver became upset when he read it - they had promised to give him money later but it was less than what the trip cost. Since the meter had been running he would have been really short. I told him I'd pay the difference as I didn't want to miss by flight. On a positive note, the room was huge if that's important to you.

<Content>An Enjoyable Stay This hotel made a perfect base for our long weekend in Berlin. Having landed at Tegel airport a bus and a couple of underground trains got us to a few hundred meters from the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful when asked for advise. The rooms were very clean and well finished. Noise was not an issue at all with no sound traveling from adjacent rooms or from outside.The breakfasts were first class with a wide selection of dishes to choose from and was open until 11:00. The gym is fairly small but has modem equipment and two separate showers. The sauna gave us a nice relaxing end to the day and was free.
