<Content>Average, nondescript etc. This is getting to sound like a broken record, but I agree with the recent reviews, and I did not stay there as recently as these reviewers. Some hotels/motels never seem to change. I don't remember much about the motel to be honest, probably because there was nothing memorable--good or bad. It was a place to stay while visiting Seattle. It was a bit North of downtown and not in the nicest looking neighborhood. However, we saw nothing bad happen around us and Aurora Ave. was a straight line to downtown so it did not take us long to drive to and from. No luxuries but no complaints either. Very reasonably priced.

<Content>Just OK Hotel is in a dicey neighborhood with a adult store across the street and liquor store near by. Check was ok but when I went to bed I found a very yucky something on the inside of the sheets. But the night clerk promptly gave a clean replacement. I would stay here again if I had to.

<Content>okay if you're going for cheap then this place is fine. complimentary internet was a real plus. there was also complimentary continental breakfast but i didn't bother with that. the receptionists were nice. the room was satisfactory for the price. the other guests looked creepy though - but then i guess whenever you stay in cheap hotel you meet those types...

<Content>Iffy Hotel Hotel seemed nice from the outside and our room was clean. Night clerk was watching South Park when we checked in late that evening. It was a little weird that he was watching that show when children, etc. could be entering the lobby. I heard several foul words while I checked in. Very unprofessional. Morning clerk would not provide a receipt since we prepaid. The more rooms I book with the online travel site, the more likely the clerk or check-in/out process will be sketchy.

<Content>Just OK It's hard to find a decent hotel in Seattle without paying at least $150-$250. This was a bit run down but still pretty clean. This hotel is pretty far from downtown (driving down Aurora street seems like it takes forever). On the positive side, my boyfriend and I found some really good restaurants nearby (on 85th street and Pheeney?) that were a lot cheaper than downtown restaurants. Parking was also free!! The room had extra pillows. The continental breakfast was muffins, waffles and coffee. We ended up moving to a hotel closer to the airport and I-5 for easier mobility.

<Content>Good Stay In light of the other reviews on this site I didn't know what to expect when staing at this property. I stayed at this location as a result of almost all hotels being full when I was booking last minute.The hotel was a bit dated and did show it's age. However the room was adequate with 2 queens and in reality the beds were very comfortable. The carpets like another review indicated are not so hot because of the cheap carpet they used you can see stains and such. Over all, the room was satisfactory for the cheap rate we paid.

<Content>Not the worst, Good for the Money We booked this hotel on-line because we needed a hotel halfway between our home and our Valentine's Day destination of Kitsap Memorial State Park cabins. I found an excellent deal of $50 so we took it. Then I read the reviews on Trip Advisor. I was so upset and worried that our romantic trip would be ruined but my boyfriend said we've stayed in worse places, it can't be that bad (and he's right, we have!!). And to be honest, the check-in went smooth, the room was clean, smaller sure, but very clean. The night clerk was excellent at his job cuz when someone burnt some food or something on one of the floors and there was lots of smoke, he called the fire department just to check it out. I was worried about feeling safe because if anyone has stayed in a hotel off Aurora Ave North, you would know some areas are sketchy but over all it was a steal for the bargain price and we would definately stay there again while travelling through. The continental breakfast was standard fare, good enough for us. Oh yah, we booked it through TripReward.com.

<Content>For the love of God NO!!! Oh my God this was the grossest experience of my life. There was a somewhat identifiable bodily fluid all over the carpet. I knew what it was but did not tell my children. I wouldn't let them walk barefoot till I put all the towels on the floor, afterall, we weren't going to bathe there. I am never going to stay at a Days Inn again. Upon returning to the hotel late in the evening there was a Police unit cruising the parking lot, not a comforting feeling. sleep in your car before staying here.

<Content>Go Elsewhere We have alway enjoyed my stays at Days Inn, but our most recent experience bordered on fraud.Normally, we stay in hotels 2-3 times a week due to business.We called ahead to check if the Days Inn North Seattle had rooms with Microwaves available. We were told yes, many rooms. We arrived, were given a rate of $109 per night. Upon arriving in the room we found it to be small with no microwave. I called the front desk and was told the hotel had a microwave in the common area only. Although I did not like this response, I accepted it, as we needed to get to the Hospital, as our third daughter was giving birth to her fist child.Upon returning to the hotel, I checked the Web site finding that the $109 rate was for a king sized bed with a kitchenette! I went to the front desk and asked the clerk what the rate was for a room with a queen sized bed with no microwave, he responded $79/night. I then informed him I was in room 314 and asked why my rate was $109/night. He was concerned as to why the difference but said I would have to speak with the manager in the morning.The next morning, after having been at the Hospital most of the night, I spoke with 鈥淏ill鈥? he said that he could not help me, I would need to speak with the Manager 鈥淒ave鈥?but he could not give me a time to contact him, I left my cell number.I called back later in the day and still was told the manager was not available and to please leave my phone number. I am an on-call technician 24/7/365, so the chance of missing his call is zero.I called again today, the clerk again could not tell me of when the manager would be available, but said he could help. I told him of the story and his response was, YOU SIGNED THE PAPER WITH THE RATE, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT!This is not the level of service I would expect from Motel 6 let alone a chain the caliber of Days Inn.

<Content>Horrible Experience. Does NOT recommend this hotel The provided breakfast was taken away at least 20 minutes before the closing time. The front desk man told a guest looking for milk to go to the laundry room and get it herself. Employees were very rude. Difficulties on reciving a receipt on check out. I will NOT be back and I will never in my life ever stay at a Days Inn. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.
