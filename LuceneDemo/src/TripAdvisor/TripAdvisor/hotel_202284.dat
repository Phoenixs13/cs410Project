<Content>Great location and good price A few minutes from the city centre: the hotel is just behind the bus stop. The staff is very kind and rooms are simple and clean. The continental breakfast is fairly rich. For those who love starting a new day with in a sweet way, the breakfast unfortunately lacks in croissant, cakes and other appetizing stuffs.The hotel is particularly recommended for those who want to spend few days in Frankfurt without spending a lot of money.
