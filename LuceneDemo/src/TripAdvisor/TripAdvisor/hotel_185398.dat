<Content>Great location not so comfy! This hotel is in a great location pretty much close to everything, the rooms are nice and big but I went in the winter and it was really cold in the room not to mention the music and noise from the outside did not let me sleep the whole 5 days I was there, I am not sure I would recommend this place!!

<Content>Lovely staff but no air-conditioning We only stayed here for one night, but were booked in for 5 nights. The room was hot in the evening, and the vents were the only 鈥渁ir-conditioning鈥? These vents could be left open or closed. At times it felt as though only hot air was being pushed through, making the room very stuffy. We barely slept and asked to be swapped to another hotel. The staff were lovely and handled this very well. They were very accommodating to us. One thing I did find and not sure it was related to the room, but I woke with little bites all over my face. No-one else in the room experienced this, only myself. It may have been a reaction to something else, but we are not certain. The food was good in the restaurant underneath.

<Content>San Marino - Amazing value for location Stayed at San Marino during business trip to Mexico City.Superb location, great value for money and decent room. Had free wifi in the room, plenty of space and reasonable breakfast.Staff friendly and helpful. Didn't spend much time in the hotel as tended to dine out at places nearby but overall had a very pleasant stay there.Will definitely return next year.

<Content>Good Value, But Some Problems The San Marino is a good value, but looks better online than in person. It was very clean and the rooms were nice, but the bed was the hardest I had ever slept on. We are smokers and had a smoking room on an upper floor. However, the windows didn't open and there was poor ventilation. After 2 days we asked to be moved and were moved to a room on the first floor that had a window that opened. That solved the venitlation problem. We also had problems with the TV in both rooms. The staff was very friendly and the breakfast buffet included in the price was very good. The location is excellent., but noisy.

<Content>Very reasonable hotel, great location A friend and I stayed at the San Marino Suites this month, and we were pleasantly surprised. It is not a very big hotel, but the room was a nice size, and it had everything that we needed: blow dryer, coffee maker, fridge, microwave, safe, etc. There was even a nice restaurant downstairs. The location was excellent. It was about a block from the Angel of Independece, and a quick walk to Chapultapec park. We even walked back from the Zocalo area, although that was pretty far. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good location Very good location.Im impressed about this hotel. Before go there I read some bad comments about this hotel, but in my case Im totally satisfied about the room, the service was excellent, the persons that work there were very helpful. The room was clean and in good conditions. I totally recommend this hotel.TIPS:The hotel is located one block from the Reforma Ave. the principal avenue of Mexico city. There you can take the Turibus, a city tour bus where you can visit some of the local attractions like the Centro Hist贸rico (Historic Downtown), Chapultepec Zoo, Museums, etc.

<Content>False advertisement The hotel was ok. Not so clean, but a good location, nice hotel for the price. However, I got really upset there. They were advertising at Expedia that if you stayed for 2 nights in a double room you would receive complimentary breakfast for two and 1 day tour. It did not happen. I arrived there, showed the ad printed proof, argued with the rude staff, spent an hour calling Expedia from a street phone because they did not offer me their phone. Therefore, I would not recommend it. False advertisement to get more clients is forbidden and Expedia should not corroborate with this. After arguing with Expedia and the hotel for one hour, I gave up.Tips: You have to go to Teotihuacan. It is even better than Chit Zen-Itza in Cancun. The Museum of Anthropology is great. There is a park in front of the Museum which is nice to walk around and see the castle and there is a zoo there. The city has lots of things to see.We booked our transport with cancuntransfers.com in Cancun, it was really good and much cheaper than at the airport. The tours we booked with entertainment-plus.net, also nice.

<Content>Great value for the Zona Rosa area The experience of the reviewer who complained about the toddler swimming pool must have been exceptional. I have stayed there several times in the past year and it is superb value for money. I live in Mexico and know what to expect in the DF!I have found it quiet and comfortable and the fact that it has free wi-fi is a big bonus. If you book on line you won鈥檛 find anything in this area for anything comparable. It鈥檚 not much more expensive than the hugely over-rated Casa Gonzalez round the corner. Plus you get a free buffet breakfast.

<Content>Be careful choosing this hotel -I'll tell you why. This is a FAMILY hotel; lots of toddlers. The central pools are for children. At 10:00 am a live dj starts playing mostly Mexican music VERY LOUD at the toddler pool area as well as broadcasting himself talking all the time. You can't sleep through it. We had to get up by 10:00 am and leave our room. Music goes on til the evening. You have to wear a wristband 24/7. Everyone we talked to hated it. It will scratch your sleeping partner and you in the shower if you're not careful. They have 24/7 guards who are fairly nasty and unreasonable. You can't get in without wearing this wristband. They won't allow you to bring friends to your room. They are very nasty about that. The water in the shower doesn't drain when the hotel is full; you sand in a 5 deep pool of your own shower water. It drains when the hotel loses a lot of guests. Got grasshoppers and crickets in our room somehow (5th floor). Wished there was a coffee machine in the room. Apart from that, it's a beautiful hotel, nice design. Won't stay again because of the loud music and nasty security system (guards and wristbands). If you choose this one, you should be an audiophile who likes a lot of loud music all day long.

<Content>Wonderful Stay! My husband, daughter, and I stayed here for a week and we absolutely loved it! The room was very clean, service was superb, the breakfast was more than what we expected! Believe me this is no continental breakfast- more like breakfast buffet with all the trimmings! My husband even got his eggs made to order every morning. The hotel staff could not be any more friendlier or attentive, we came in late almost every night (after 2am) and there was someone to greet us at the door and valet our car with all smiles and this gave us a great sense of security. The hotel is also in one of the nicest neighborhoods around which was a sigh of relief for us. Even though we were in this big city, we felt very safe in this small but very cosy hotel. I would definitely stay here again, rather than pay for those big chain hotels with big prices, and staff that can't possibly remember how you like your eggs in the morning!

<Content>great hotel, great price,clean great service The San Marino Suites were wonderful. There is a person who will help if you don't speak Spanish. You might e-mail them. WE ARRIVED VERY LATE AT NIGHT TWO TIMES. There was still valet service for our car waiting at the door at 12:30 at night!!!!This service is just 10 American dollars per day. The room is cleaned very nice each day. The breakfast buffet is very nice. Since we have 2 vegetarians the extensive fruit is very nice. Roberto serves you very quickly in the restaurant. The hotel gives you bottled water each day, fresh towels etc. It was quiet. I was on a high floor. Thanks it was a nice stay. It is near all tourist attractions and within a mile of public transportation. The subways are an easy way to travel once you get used to them. To go to the pyramids you can take a subway to central bus station. That costs .25. The bus is about 2.50 american. The Beaux arts is absolutely stunning if you like murals. It is nice to go into the mountains if possible. They are beautiful. We stayed 10 days and the hotel was consistent the whole time.

<Content>Rip off!!! The hotel doesn't come anywhere near the description one may find on various hotel booking websites. Air-conditionned room means that you get a room where the air conditionning WILL automatically stop at 1:00 am. It doesn't come back on until noon the next day. Breakfast buffet is normally served at 7:00 am. My friend and I had to wait in the restaurant with 10 other people in the dark until 7:30 am. Finally we had to go the reception desk to ask them to kindly turn the lights on. Beware the taxi service provided y the hotel, they charge twice as much as any other taxi hailed in the street.One can find much better comfort and service in Mexico City for the same price.

<Content>Great value I didnt find a review about this hotel but the pictures and the location were enough for me. So my partner and I decided to stay there. The rooms were quite confortable, the furniture in perfect shape. The bed was hard but very confortable after a trip of 17 hours by plane. Also we had a great feathers blanquet that keep us warm and everything in the room and the toilet was very clean. There is not carpet, but is a wooden floor and for people like me that suffer with allergies is a great location. The only thing that was a minus was that we were in the 12th floor next to the operation room of the lifts and they were a little bit noisy. But I really recommend this great hotel.
