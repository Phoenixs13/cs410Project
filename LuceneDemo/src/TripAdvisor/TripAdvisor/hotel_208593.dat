<Content>Very Disappointing I booked our stay in Barcelona for one week before we left on a Western Mediterranean Cruise. Our idea was to be close to Las Rambas and close to the Port.When we arrived, we were presented with what appeared to be a shabby hole in the wall on Carrer Rauric. It does not have an elevator. The room can only be called Spartan. The view was of a window of the building directly across the street. The streets in the Gothic Quarter are very narrow--of course this is the atmosphere that I had wanted.The continental breakfast was fine. But, the hotel is definitely not in a safe area of the city. Walking back to the hotel at about 1 a.m. on the first night, we were 'almost' robbed by locals.The next morning, we relocated to the Hotel Axel. Much better area and still close to everything. Much better accommodations. Furthermore; during the rest of the week, not a single incident of attempted robbery.While the Hotel California is located in a very central location and the accommodations are 'acceptable', if you can afford better, chose another hotel.

<Content>Great value We arrived before our cruise 11/7/2008 and stayed for one night and upon return stayed 11/15 and 11/16. Our dealings with the staff (in English) was prompt and truthful. They quoted the room rate in Euros and gave the total including taxes and fees. There was never a question about the rate when we arrived. So helpful and service oriented. No elevator but they carried our heavy luggage upstairs for us. We did not have problems with the noise. Enjoyed the balcony in each room we had. Very clean and safe. Front entry doors are locked at all times and they have 24 hr desk attendance. Provided a n electric jack and hair dryer. You must ask at the desk. Considering the difference in American hotels and Euro hotels this was very good and did incl a good continental breakfast which was incl and many you pay extra. Bed hard but tolerable. We were only there to sleep at night and went sight seeing during day. This has location, location, location right off Las Ramblas. We rode the train from airport and took metro to hotel and walked with our luggage from metro to hotel. We planned to take the blue bus from Las Ramblas to the ship but never could find the stop so we walked with our luggage from hotel to the ship. Very long way. Would not advise this. Upon return we found the blue bus stop at the Columbus monument. You can't use your metro/train ticket on the blue bus. If you plan to sight see Barcelona either buy the tour bus ticket or buy a T10. The T 10 can be used on the train and metro and is good for an extended period of time. I'd stay again with them! Very thoughtful of their guests!

<Content>Simple, great location Great location in heart of Barri Gotic and 200 metres to Las Ramblas and Liceu metro station. It was basic with small rooms but that was what we expected given the price. Functional with decent breakfast, friendly staff and importantly no hiccups in any way. The location is the main selling point.

<Content>Great Little Hotel in a Fantastic Location Wonderful Hotel. First the facts: Great location. No elevators. Tiny Room - clean. Bathroom was terrific. Breakfast was ok - coffee and sweet rolls. My impression - great value, wonderful service. I booked directly with the hotel via email and had no problem whatsoever. This is a low-budget European hotel so don't expect the Ritz. I won't hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Great Place to Stay We stayed one week at the Hotel California in Barcelona. The hotel is in a great location, just off La Rambles and close to the Plaze Rieal. There are lots of bars, tapas bars, shops, museums, and places to eat near by. The staff at the hotel were great. They were very friendly and helpful. They greeted us with a smile every time we came in the door. The rooms are a decent size and the bathroom was great. Our bathroom had a sliding door with a small terrace off of it, which provided lots of natural light to the room. The room had a large closet with lots of shelves and hangers and A/C. It was clean and quiet. The only downfall was the very hard bed. The price of the room was 85 Euros a night, which included breakfast. Breakfast was standard with cereal, breads, coffee, tea, juice and hot chocolate. The long hours for breakfast (8-11) were great. This was by far the best room we stayed in on our trip (out of 4) and the best value as well. I would stay there again!

<Content>Noisy but reasonable value We stayed for 3 nights, booked via their website. Arrangements were excellent with e-mails (in English) being answered / actioned very quickly; they asked for a confirmation one week before arrival. Reception very helpful but be aware there is no lift to any of the 3 floors. We were offered a choice of rooms and settled for room 103 (double on first floor on corner of the property, at the front). The self-service Continental breakfast was plentiful (but no ham, cheese, yoghurt or fruit). The rooms were clean but they could do with a bit more 'tender loving care' and some basic investment / up-grade of the mattress, top sheets and furniture; hot water was always available. The hotel location is very good on a street off the Ramblas. Good Irish Bars locally (try Molly's Fair City) and try the Schilling Bar for coffeee  beer as some on the street were rip offs (especially one close to / on the same side as the Schilling offering tapas). Do not eat at the Compestella Restaurant on this street as they could not get you out of the place quick enough (you only got an apple for your sweet on the tourist menu for 16 Euros!). For a quick, cheap lunch or snack try the Pans chain of sandwich shops. The best way to see the city is the Official Tourist Bus, but do not expect anyone to be courteous and queue as they charge on and even laugh at you when you complain; also use the vouchers they give you on the bus for discounts to attractions and for food. The only complaint we had was about the noise in the street outside the hotel - do not expect a good night's sleep as locals were drinking cans of beer outside the hotel (just in the street) up to 5.00 a.m. each evening / morning. The hotel is supposed to be double glazed with air-conditioning - the first doesn't work as you can hear every word spoken / shouted, but at least the air conditioning did. I would not like to stay here in the main holiday period in the summer months. In summary, it is worth the money for what you get and where it is. We will not be returning to Barcelona and three days was enough to do what we wanted to do / see.

<Content>Gay hotel but nice;) Was a nice stay - 8 nights and we were happy with it;) In the begining was strange for me - I speak good Spanish and I tryied to be kind with the reception guy - always saying Hello, how are you . The funny thing is they always answered me shortly - something not at all typical for the Spanish people, especially men! In the end of our stay my husband went downstairs to leave the luggage and he was 20min late. I asked him what happened and he said - well the reception guy was really nice with me and he wanted to ask me how I am and when do we go home, what do I do...It was strange! I realized that the owners/reception guys are gays!!!But in general was a good hotel with BAD breakfast - only sweet things...no cheese, no ham...

<Content>Quaint And Pleasant The hotel was a good value considering that it is a block off the Ramblas, in the heart of a most interesting area, is in walking distance to many sites and transportation, and is in a city that is quite expensive. Our 98 Euros for a room with 2 single beds included breakfast and all taxes. The hotel is small, unpretensious and without a lift to the second floor. However, our basic room was spacious with everything in good working order, had been redone not too long ago, and was quite pleasant with a small balcony overlooking the narrow and busy street. The breakfast room was nice with an adequate number of tables and the food was basic (cereals, breads, pastries, juices, milk, coffee, tea, etc.). The staff were friendly and helpful and were available 24/7 at the desk. We really enjoyed our stay here.

<Content>you get what you pay for we're just back from 6 nights at the hotel, we had no major problems with it. It is quite easy to get to from the green line 3 Liceu metro stop. Once you come out of the metro station turn down the ramblas following the McDonalds signs, turn down the street with the KFC and McDonalds on both sides its about 100 yards down on the right. The street is called Carrier de Rauric or something similar and i must admit it does look a bit shabby but its safe enough. when we first arrived there looked to be a few homeless people on this street but this was the first and last time we saw them, the streets are washed down each night by the council so this probably acts as a deterrant.the hotel itself was basic but very clean, our rooms were cleaned on a daily basis whilst we were there. our double room was a little on the small side but for the little time we spent there it wasnt much of a problem. the bathroom was nicely decorated however there was a bit of mould and damp around the shower. satalite tv was provided however all of the channels except sky news were in spanish.breakfast wasnt great, cereal, croissants and other rolls were provided along with tea coffee and fruit juice but it was something to start your day off with. overall this hotel was satisfactory, the location was excellent and the staff were really helpful and friendly as well as all speaking really good english i would definitely recommend it, its not the ritz but you dont come to barcelona and spend a lot of time in your hotel!

<Content>Excellent stay This hotel is very centrally located just off one of the main streets in the old town and close to Las Ramblas. Quite difficult to find initially however because it is down a side street.Room was clean and comfortable, and staff friendly. Breakfast could have done with a bit more choice though.A thoroughly enjoyable stay overall.

<Content>Great Location. Just returned from a lovely stay at the California Hotel, Barcelona. Arrived at the main Barcelona airport with Easyjet. Its very easy to catch the Aerobus from outside the terminal building. This takes you directly to Placa Catalunya for 3.90 euro single taking around 30 minutes. The walk to the hotel from Placa Catalunya is around 10 minutes.Stayed in a twin bedded room from 19-25th May, 2007. The room rate included breakfast and was served from 07:00 until 11:00 daily. The breakfast is fairly basic but does offer juice, tea, coffee, breads and jam. This is a small hotel, very clean, the staff are friendly and the location is excellent.

<Content>Great Little Hotel.... I have stayed at the Hotel California several times over the years. It's not the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo but is very clean friendly and convenient. Like other reviewers have stated yes it can be noisy especially at night but it's located where all the action is so that's expected. And if you are in BCN for only a few nights I had no problem with the street noise. I just booked it for 3 nights this year before and after a Med cruise. For $125 USD/night/room in Las Ramblas you can't beat it!

<Content>Don't stay here! This is one of the worst 2 star hotels I have ever stayed in. We turned up to find that our double booking had somehow become a twin and that we couldn't move rooms until the next day. Then they switched us to what had to be the worst room in the whole building. The bathroom had obviously been painted and grouted recently and the fumes were overwhelming, even with the door shut. But worse was the shower itself, which had no hot water pressure - leaving us to shower under the barest trickle of water. Despite repeated requests nothing was done to fix the shower, move us to an alternative room or give us a discount on the room rate. The only saving grace was that we were just in Barcelona for a weekend and so spent most of the time out of the room. The hotel is in a great location, but there are other options nearby and quite frankly it would be worth paying a bit more to avoid this place. Do not stay here.

<Content>Safe For Women I have stayed at the Hotel California on 6 occasions while attending a language college and travelling on my own. The only way to enter the hotel is if you are let into the building by the desk staff. This means that you can be sure that people are not just wandering around in the building. This has always made me feel very safe.The desk staff are all wonderful and greet me like an old friend. The rooms and bathrooms are clean It can be noisy in the summer but is less so in the winter - in any case, the air-conditioning is very effective and, if used along with earplugs, will drown out the worst of the noise!!Breakfast is included in the price - there isn't that much choice but it is tasty and nicely presented. I love this hotel and am back there in 7 weeks - I can't wait.

<Content>Cannot do better I have been using the Hotel California now for 13 years, in my humble opinion you cannot do better for the money. It is centrally situated, get the bus/underground/train from the airport to Plaza Catalunia and walk down the Ramblas towards the port. Just past the Liceu opera house and underground station on your left hand side is a street with a McDonalds on the one corner and a KFC on the other (dont be put off now though, read on). Walk up this street approx 100 yards and the street is on the right hand side, 20 yds down this very tiny street is this fabulous gem. Staff, service, service, cleanliness and security is seond to non, 24hr reception. Breakfast excellent value. Need any help....just ask and the staff will go out of their way. Enough of this babble, just book and go.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised Hotel California is located in the Gothic Quarter. It's a great location just off of Placa Real and very close to Las Ramblas. There was a little bit of noisy, but it wasn't anything more than you can expect in a big city. I had no problems with it. I was concerned by some of the previous reviews and was prepared for the worst. I had decided to stay here, to save a little money which I was planning to spend on more upscale hotels at other stops during my visit to Spain. I was very pleasantly surprised. The room was larger and brighter than I had expected. I was really surprised by the size of the bathroom and tub/shower. This too was bigger than many I've had while travelling in Europe. Though the rooms were spartan, they were still clean and comfortable. The breakfast was plain with no variety. I think most Americans would be ok with it for a few days. After 3 days, I was ready for something new. There's no yogurt, hard-boiled eggs or fruit. This place is a great value for your money. It's clean and comfortable, and in a great location. I recommend it.

<Content>Clean hotel, polite, English speaking staff, great value for money Lovely small, clean hotel located in the heart of the old centre of Barcelona. Small clean rooms, daily changing of towels. Simple breakfast buffet from 7 till 11 a.m. The two main disadvantages: 1) the noisy area (since late at night the bars in the Barri Got铆c area are open till 2-3 a.m. and people tend to walk around talking loudly), but if you undertake a lot during the day you will easily sleep through it. 2) Small disadvantage is the small foyer. If you are three or more people together it will feel like a crowded place. But apart from these two points this is a great hotel on a great location. The shopping area is at your feet. The lovely Pla莽a Reial Square is around the corner. Sandwich bars everywhere around. The Ramblas area and the closest subway station just a 5 min walk away, Pla莽a Catalunya (for Touristic Lines and coach services to and from the airport and neighbouring towns) just a 10 min walk. I would certainly book this hotel again on my next trip to Barcelona. The photographs provided on the web site of the hotel very closely resemble the actual look of the rooms.

<Content>Great location, decent price - does the job This hotel couldn't be more central - just 100 metres off La Rambla. Rooms are clean, fairly spacious, and bathrooms are a good size as well. The staff were friendly which is always a bonus and held our luggage in reception for us all day as we didn't fly out until late evening. Breakfast was ok, nothing to write home about, but pretty standard. I can appreciate this place might be noisy in Summer when you have to have the window open at night, being located just over a few pubs, but in Winter this didn't bother us. I'd stay here again, and would recommend it.

<Content>Safe, clean and very good value for money This hotel is situated very centrally indeed, being a stone's throw from the Ramblas, and a five-minute walk to Plaza de Catalunya, which is the transport hub of the city of Barcelona. I have stayed in many hotels in Barcelona (I lived there for a year and often go back to visit) and in my opinion this offers the best value for money of any I have ever stayed in.When you build your expectations, bear in mind that this is a 2 star, budget hotel in the centre of Barcelona, which is a vibrant, 24-hour European party city. Some of the reviews of the hotel I have just read for this page are laughably naive. You will not get satellite TV, you will not see a large American-style lobby and there is no room service - if you want these luxuries, don't expect to get them from a budget hotel, and book into a larger hotel nearby. The hotel is run very efficiently from a small front desk, by very friendly staff.The hotel is located at the heart of the city, where the Gothic Quarter meets the Chinese Quarter (also known as the Raval). This is not a tranquil, tree-lined part of the city - it's the hot, lively, noisy, seedy heart of the city. If you want to have a hotel with staid respectability, go and stay up on the Diagonal or in Gracia, which are the yuppie areas of town.A lot is made of this hotel's gay friendly atmosphere on certain web pages, but this is misleading - the hotel is welcoming of ALL people, not just gay people. I am a gay man myself but the majority of people who stay here represent a regular cross section of travellers - the hotel is not seedy.The rooms are a good size for a budget hotel but most importantly they are clean which, even now that there is so much competition in the hotel trade, is a luxury in this hotel category in Barcelona. I have had no problem with the space of my room on any visit. The bathrooms are not mouldy or musty, and are clean and to a similar standard as the bedrooms. I have had no reason to use the electrical points but I find it hard to believe that the wiring would cause any device to explode, as one reviewer has mentioned. More likely is that the reviewer has used an inappropriate adapter - European plugs deliver 240V and not 110V as in the US.I hope this balances up some of the negative comments. In brief, this hotel is not a luxury establishment but it is safe and clean, with a friendly atmosphere, and it's based in the most exciting part of the city.

<Content>excellent value and location I stayed at the Hotel California in Barcelona for 4 nights at the start of October. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, the Location was perfect, just off the Ramblas, the Room was god and the bathroom was excellent - large, fully tiled and very clean. the Breakfast was ok, various breads, preserves and cereals, and plenty of it. The only down side was that our room was on the 4th floor which was a bit of a hike twice a day, the stairs are quite steep. However this was a small price to pay for something that otherwise was excellent value.I would recommend this for most people...a good basic, clean, central hotel at a good price.

<Content>Pay more or stay home! I arrived at the hotel, having been ripped off by the taxi driver. That was only the beginning of the problem. What was described as the reception area was a 6 foot wide landing with 2 chairs on the stairs. Although already warm in Barc they had not yet turned on the a/c and only offered heat, which I certainly did not need. I was helped with my bags to the 3rd floor to my single room. Without exaggeration it was 7' wide and about 9'long, including a small desk, night stand and closet! When my suitcases were open on the floor I could not walk in the room. The en-suite bathroom was large, and so was the mildew all over. It was supposed to be a quiet rear facing room, but with the window open, the courtyard was filled with the sounds of a loud radio, a baby crying, an argument and in the morning a rooster crowing. All with a view of laundry hanging from windows. There was no electrical outlet other than for the cable TV (spanish only-no CNN) so I unplugged it to plug in my electric clock, WITH a converter, but the wiring was so bad it blew out the clock. The promised in-room personal safe does not exist. Cheesy bed, cheesy towels, the most depressing place I have ever stayed at in my life. I had booked on-line for 6 nights but fled after the first night. I peeked next door at a double and there was just enough room to get around the double bed. If you cant afford more, stay home!

<Content>Such a lovely place, such a noisy place Barcelona's Hotel California is central to the activity of the Old Town, the world famous Ramblas avenue is approximately 100 yards away.This is a small, two star hotel, no elevators so if you are on the third floor it is a bit of a climb. The hotel reception operates 24 hours and the staff all speak good English and were charming and very helpful. Rooms are simple but very clean, all with TV, efficient air-con and en-suite bathrooms.Not expensive for central Barcelona and if you don't want the inclusive breakfast (selection of cereals, pastries, rolls, juice, tea, coffee available from 7am to 11am) there are good restaurants close by serving everything you could wish for.The Hotel California (and when you check in the guy actually says 'Welcome to the Hotel California!') is in a very narrow side street so no view worth talking about even if you have one of the rooms with a tiny balcony. The entrance to this street was (and we were informed has been for quite some time) the dwelling place for several homeless people. They are not threatening in any way but when the local bars close (and there is an Irish bar right next to the entrance to the hotel) these vagrants become very noisy as do the many young tourists. With bars in Barcelona (and there are lots of bars in Barcelona) closing at any time between 2am and 5am don't expect a lot of sleep.

<Content>You get what you pay for We stayed at this hotel on a Spanish Grand Prix weekend last year. We booked the trip quite late, and given the demand for accomodation that weekend we had a limited choice. Our priority at the time was something as cheap as we could get close to the city centre, which is exactly what we got. The hotel has a good location - just 2 minutes walk from La Ramblas - the main tourist street. However the street it is actually on is pretty bad. Having turned off La Ramblas onto a reasonably sized side-street, we had to turn off again onto what I would call an alleyway, and that was where we found the hotel.The area around is full of people sleeping rough. On turning onto the alley where the hotel was each evening we had to weave our way through a group of homeless folk cooking food on a fire at the corner. Having said that they did not disturb us or ever approach us, they minded their own business.The hotel itself does not have a bar or a restaurant. Our room was tiny and very dark. However the hotel was always very clean and the staff at the desk were always very friendly and very helpful.All-in-all if you are looking for a cheap trip, it's not the worst option, Do not expect luxury and a view becasue you will be dissapointed, however the price does reflect this.

<Content>Good value place to stay! I would certainly return to this hotel and recommend it to friends and family.Very pleasant small 2*hotel with 4* value. Exceptionally clean and tidy. Breakfast was adequate and unhurried. Receptionist staff spoke OK english and were very helpful.Hotel California is situated in an ideal location, just off Las Ramblas and next to Placa Reial. Could be a bit noisy but that's what holidays are for.I have read that it is one of a few hotels in Barcelona that is happy to accomodate openly gay couples.
