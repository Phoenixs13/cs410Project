<Content>Nice Hotel, Great Location This is a very nice hotel located very centrally for tourists. Within walking distance to the Louvre, Opera House, etc. Room was a little dated(scratches on the walls, etc), but very clean. The staff was all bilingual(French/English). Room was large by Paris standards. The staff suggested a small restaurant called Lucerne, which is just around the corner. Very small, very good.

<Content>Very worthwhile Just back from a week in Paris and stayed at the Castille. I had reveiwed all I could about the hotels in Paris on Tripadvisor and this one had the least problematic results so I chose it! NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! First off, very professional staff. Helpful, friendly and all were bilingual/fluent in English. Very nice room. Large for European standards. Large bathroom as well. Shower was a little narrow, however easy to overlook that! The room itself faced onto a street that has Chanel boutique, an elementary school,a financial instution of some sort and then further down a cafe and assorted little clothing stores. Hotel was quiet for the most part. You always hear people coming and going anywhere (ie doors). This is a high rent district, but close to all the major attractions/either by walking or Metro. Metro is effecient and quite easy to use + cheap!! Good bakeries are within walking distance filled with goodies...little grocery stores around Paris - Wine is dirt cheap there and good - buy a small brie, a baguette, some deli meat and of course the wine...save $$$ on lunch that way. I don't think there are any liquor laws about drinking in the park with a picnic?? Always order expresso or cafe noir or you get crappy coffee which isn't what you're looking for!!! Tips of 15% are included in the bill automatically - but most staff are quite friendly and polite and a tip of 1-2 Euro for the extra friendly ones goes a long way! If you stay at this hotel, there is a restaurant which has a little tea room and bakery attached that is just up the street and is called the Olympia Cafe I believe....excellent service, great atmosphere and all the dishes we sampled were all great!

<Content>Nice stay at the Castille Last week I've stayed 3 nights at the Castille with my husband and daughter (She's 12 years old). Normally when we travel to Paris we stay at a nice little boutique hotel (Hotel de la TourMaubourg) in the 7th arrondissement. Since this hotel was fully booked I chose the Castille, because I thought it would be nice to explore the 1st arrondissement this time. And so we did. We had a nice time at the Castille. The neighbourhood is really pleasant, with all the great shops and Chanel next door! Lots of 'brasseries' for a breakfast, espresso or wine close by, and rue St Honoree is super to have so near to your hotel! I like the way the Castille is decorated. We had a 'triple-room': our daughter had her own bathroom and a pull-out sofa. With the stairs she came in our part, with our own bathroom. (marble as well). There was a large window to look at the rue Cambon which was really nice. The concierges were very kind and polite. In the evening we had some drinks at the bar and the barman was very sympathetic too. I find that in the past 10 years the French really have changed! (Much less arrogant! ;-) I must say that we would recommend the Castille and that we will come back whenever we'll visit the 1st arrondissement again.

<Content>Loved the Castille! The description of the hotel sounded perfect. But when i went to read the reviews, several people complained that the concierge services were lacking, so we went ahead with the reservation but with apprehension. The service we got from concierges Benoit and Nahim was absolutely fantastic. While the room was lovely (after we changed three times), our concierges made the stay! If you are looking for a cozy little bar for a drink after dinner, though, please skip the bar in the hotel. The bartender was clueless. And defensive about his lack of knowledge! There are several other nearby places to go. We would defintely go back to the Castille.

<Content>Great location, beautiful hotel. I took my (now) fiancee to Paris for a romantic 6 night break in Nov 2006. Couldn't have picked a better hotel.The location is excellent - we were able to walk everywhere (Paris is quite compact) which meant we made the most of our time.The rooms were lovely: we chilled for a couple of hours (after walking all day) each evening, before heading out to dinner. Again lots of restaurants in easy walking distance (10-15mins).The hotel breakfasts were fantastic and got us well set up for the day.Will definitely go back.

<Content>beautiful! Clean! For a quick weekend trip to Paris, and for our first time, this hotel was perfect! Our room was so clean and tidy! The bathroom nicely appointed-wc in another room was an added bonus, and a great hairdryer. It was not a big room, but I was not entertaining, It was clean and bright!The breakfast, included (check with the desk), was wonderful! But who wants to skip a meal in Paris, so I used restraint!The conceierge was fine. I didn't need too much. We were in a great neighborhood, and I was able to walk around without worries of being alone. Chanel, Leger, Cartier, Hermes...all right around you. Also, Zara, a GAP (of all things) and other resonable stores, although it is a city, and the dollar is BAD so eat, don't shop! Great selection of Brasseries (with great 16 euro meals) right around the corner.Not for young kids. A wonderful hotel!

<Content>Beatiful hotel We stayed one week and the hotel is perfect - the location, the rooms and the maid service are excellent. We stayed in Superior King Size Room and it was very spacios, with separate living area and very nice interior. The only problem we had was the last night. Our son arrived for the last night of our stay and I asked, twice during the day, the sofa to be made up for the night. Unfortunately when we came back (around 23.00) nothing has been done. The maid wasn't there anymore, so we had to fix up the sofa. The receptionist apologised sincerely for the caused inconvenience, but our last night was spoiled. So, overall it is a very nice place, just make sure the staff writes down your request.

<Content>Updated boutique hotel Hotel redone in black/white design. Rooms are charming. Maid service was excellent. Breakfast was delicious. Hotel is across street from back of Ritz and entrance to famous Hemingway Bar, and right behind Place de la Concorde. Service from concierge and front desk was good but not great--they seemed to care but didn't quite care--maybe the manager was away or more training of staff was needed. This was not enough to ruin hotel stay but put a slight damper on hotel, the only flaw. Newly designed, the lobby and restaurant rooms are modern and colorful and beautiful. If the hotel staff got trained a little bit more in what clients need for comfort and vacation, the Hotel Castille would be absolutely perfect! The location is right in the middle of the best arronsidement, Madeleine is down the street, original Chanel store is next door, the best shopping is RIGHT there, close to Louvre and Rue de Rivoli. Fantastic shops and little restaurants--just what we wanted.

<Content>A Charming Hotel Our first time in Paris and how fortunate for my husband and I to stay at The Castille Paris. The staff is absolutely wonderful, there is nothing you can ask for that they cannot or will not provide for you and everyone speaks English so there was not a language problem. We stayed in Paris for almost 2 weeks so for that time the hotel became home. We were treated as if we were the only people in the hotel with no request being too big or too small. It was a wonderful experience being at the Castille. The location is perfect and we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Excellent excellent excellent..... I booked into the Castille Paris for a 4 night break to celebrate my wife's 30th birthday. The location is excellent, just off Rue Rivoli which has an abundance of cafes to choose from, and right next to Chanel, giving it a slightly more exclusive feel. It took us about 30 mins to walk to Notre Dame and it's a 5 minute walk into the gardens which lead up to the Louvre. At the other end of Rue Cambon you have a major shopping area and are right near a top wine seller - Lavinia. First impressions of the hotel were excellent - we were given a brief tour of the hotel's facilities by a very friendly receptionist and then shown to our room. You get what you pay for in Paris and whilst the room was not huge, it was a perfectly good size and had a generous bathroom. We had room 153 which looked out onto a garden and was very private. Everything was extremely clean and the bed was possibly the most comfortable I have ever experienced away from home....Service throughout our stay was excellent, a very well informed concierge, attentive bar staff and a well organised reception desk. We didn't eat in the restaurant but it looked very good.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and would certainly return in the future.

<Content>Perfect position My husband booked a surprise trip for my birthday, 3 nights from 25th Feb, and having just read through some of the most recent reviews I can only agree that the hotel is excellently positioned for the Louvre  for travelling around Paris in general. We found the staff very friendly  the Concierge was most helpful in advising us about an open-top busride (As it was pouring with rain, he sent us to the office where the buses started from, meaning that we could grab 2 seats downstairs). We had a deluxe room  it was perfectly adequate - we could even see Napoleon on his column situated in Place Vendome from our window!

<Content>Great hotel with some minor drawbacks My wife and I stayed at the Starhotel Castille last weekend and we were not disappointed. It is perfectly situated in the Louvre area and ideal to get round Paris (Madeleine m茅tro is nearby) and for shopping (the boutiques of rue Sainte-Honor茅 are seconds away, and Chanel is literally next door). Our room was comfortable (we were upgraded to the split-level 'duplex' suite) and very quiet. Staff were polite and helpful. Breakfast was first class, although expensive (it was included in our tariff, so we were relaxed). We did not try the restaurant for an evening meal, but the Italian restaurant in the next street rue Duphot (Le delizie di uggiano) was excellent, if pricey.Some minor drawbacks: our room was indeed very hot (as other reviewers have noted), the headline room prices are exorbitant (our suite was listed at over 鈧?000 per night, which it was certainly not worth - as a result of booking online and the upgrade, we paid a third of that) and our room was slightly shabby and claustrophobic (in the duplex the space is all vertical rather than horizontal).Also, we had some water from the mini-bar that was obviously tap water in a bottle (it was sealed with a sticker, and with traces of previous stickers). We assumed we would not have to pay, but were surprised to see 鈧? on our bill. This was a rip-off, but to their credit the hotel did deduct the item when we protested.We would stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel, great location We stayed at the Castille for 3 nights and had an excellent experience. Our superior room was beautiful and spacious and the bathroom was large and clean. Our room was on the 4th floor, with a nice balcony, overlooking the Parisian roofs. The location of this hotel was excellent, we could walk everywhere, and the nearest metro was also walking distance. The hotel serves wonderful breakfast with a wide selection of cooked breakfast food, as well as pastries, cakes and fresh fruit. The staff was helfpul and very welcoming. We had a great stay and when we are in Paris next time, we will definitely stay at this hotel again!

<Content>Great area, nice hotel Went to Paris in April 2007. This hotel is in a luxurious location near all the trendy boutiques and right in the heart of Paris. The hotel is very well decorated and feels special. The staff were all helpful. Rooms not the biggest but nice enough. Very expensive for dinner in the hotel and would go elsewhere if you are on a budget. We had a fantastic time and would stay here again.

<Content>Amazing Treasure in Paris Just got back from Paris was there from the 7th-14th of January and stayed at hotel Castille. The hotel was amazing, perfect location!!!!! Walking distance to every where you would want to go (except eiffel Tower). The staff was amazing kind gracious and went above and beyond to make sure my stay was the very best it could possibly be.The hotel it self was amazing. The decor was modern but very warm with a little bit of an old parisian flare. I stayed in room 506 which was the deluxe room and it was not small but not large it was a perfect size for 2 people with windows facing directly over rue cambon with it's own private balcony (not really much of a view). The bed was like sleeping on a cloud amazing very high thread sheet count. The food of the hotel was good did not eat at the restaurant but I did look really lovely, however I did order room service for breakfast on a couple of occassions and everything I had was great.I normally stay at the Ritz Carlton but could not get a room thank god for me because this is my new favorite hotel in Paris. It is a small boutique hotel with out the attitude that comes with most botique hotels. It is a must for anyone coming to Paris will make your stay so memorable.

<Content>The Good and the Bad We stayed here in November and, overall, were very happy. Here is the good and the bad:Good: Our room was very pretty. We had a two story room in the contemporary side of the hotel. We had two very nice marble bathrooms which was awesome and a super comfy bed (although the commode was on the first floor, which was not fun if you had to head to the bathroom in the middle of the night!). If you want to be near the Louvre or the Champs, perfect location. We loved the breakfast at the hotel and the restaurant across the street and down just a little (I cannot recall the name, but it was on the same street). Breakfast was awesome -- we LOVED it and it was great that it was included. Also, the hotel itself is very quaint and pretty.Bad: Our bedroom (upstairs) was scorching hot and I feel like we complained and they just said yes, we have heard that before. I hate being hot when I sleep and this almost killed me. Also, we booked this hotel because Orbitz said it was in the Latin Quarter, which it is NOT. It is across the Seinne by the Louvre, but because I had never been to Paris before, I did not learn this until later :( . Finally, I found the concierge to be somewhat of a dimwit. We asked him to make a reservation for us at one of the restaurants and he said he would, but never called us back. The next day I called him and he said that he had made it, but for an hour earlier than we requested because that's all they had -- glad I called!I liked this hotel a lot, but I loved the Latin Quarter and would prefer to stay there next time. Trust me, if you are a woman, stay in the Latin Quarter -- best shopping, cafes etc .... so cute!And for dinner try IL Bouquinista (I am sure I spelled that wrong). It. Was. Awesome! The roasted chestnut bisque was the most amazing soup I have ever tasted!
