<Content>Above average Stayed three nights at the Villa Amadeus during Easter. Found the hotel conveniently located, within walking distance of the city center and with easy access to Berlin's metro lines. My room was spacious and well furinished, with two single beds, armchair, desk, closet and colour TV with international chanels (CNN, BBC etc), but no mini bar unfortunately. Bathroom was equaly spacious and eqquiped with toiletries and hairdryer, but no bathtub. Room and hotel premises appeared very clean. Breakfest was served starting at 8 am in a buffet style and consisted of coffee, tea, juices, bread, butter, selection of cheeses, ham, salami, boiled eggs, confitures, mozzarela with tomatoes, and steamed sausages. I was impressed with the quality of items served. Staff is courteous for european standards of customer service. Paid 50 euros per night, inclusive of breakfest. Would definetely stay there again.

<Content>Hotel Villa Amadeus, quiet in the middle of the town Hotel Villa Amadeus, quiet in middle of the townIt's a romantic hotel on a very quiet place near the Potsdamerplatz. The rooms have space and average comfort. The breakfast is excellent and the people very friendly. Because of the settling in former normal houses you have yhe idea you live a while in Berlin as a Berliner.
