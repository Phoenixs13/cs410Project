<Content>Cute Hotel - Nicest Staff Ever I really liked this hotel. The staff were the friendliest of any place I've ever stayed and it's obvious that they're happy in their work and treated well. I really commend the management on this point. The dining room is lovely with high ceilings, really comfortable seats and massive windows looking out over the terrace and lake. The lake itself is quite pretty with plenty of mature trees surrounding it giving a nice view for a city hotel. Most of the bedrooms look out onto this lake which is another bonus. The dinner is absolutely outstanding with everything cooked from scratch (no nuking goes on here). I believe the single rooms are tiny so beware when booking - I had a double which I was very pleased with. The pool is small but it's not so small that you can't use it for exercise; there's a good sauna in the leisure centre too along with the most amazing power showers that give wonderful massages. It's quite close to the ICC which is convenient for business travellers and there's a supermarket called 'Kaiser's' two blocks away and about 6 or 7 very reasonable and recommended restaurants all within a 5 minute walk. There's a bus that brings you into the action (Number 100) about 60 seconds from the front of the hotel. The S-bahn and the U-Bahn are a little further away - approx 10 min walk. On the downside the wireless connection wasn't great in my room - it was a very weak signal that cut out quite a bit. The bar is a bit pokey and not very nice but they have a pretty good selection of beers, spirits and cocktails. This is a Ring Hotel and when I go back to Germany I will definitely consider staying at a hotel in this chain because I have not felt so comfortable in a hotel in a long time.

<Content>Good hotel just outside the centre I stayed at the Seehof Hotel between 19-20 of April 2007 and I paid 99 euro including breakfast. WiFi is about another 12 euro extra a day. As the hotel had a four star ranking outside, I think the price was very, very reasonable. The hotel is located in a residential area and is very quiet and feels very safe. The location within Berlin is so-so as there is about 8-9 stops on the subway (less than 1 km away) until you are in the centre and in the local neighbourhood there isn鈥檛 too much to see. The exterior of the hotel gives you a sudden feeling of something that has ran away from east Berlin but don鈥檛 let that fool you. The hotel is located just by a small lake (big pond) and has a terrace overlooking the lake. Unfortunately, the weather didn鈥檛 offer any terrace sitting opportunities. The check-in was quick and the staff (which goes for all the staff) was polite but efficient. The rooms are medium sized with a large bed (120 cm) which was VERY comfortable, one of the best I have had in a hotel ever. The room was very clean and all supplies hade been well stocked. Personally, I don鈥檛 like this kind of room interior as I prefer more modern decoration instead of dark wood and carpeting. But that is just a matter of personal opinion so I don鈥檛 take that into consideration when reviewing. There is a TV set with a whole bunch of German TV channels which basically means you won鈥檛 watch any TV. The hotel restaurant is fair but slightly overpriced in my opinion and I have had much better meals in Germany for less. Though I would like to point out that the service is good and the kitchen is lightning-fast. Unfortunately we couldn鈥檛 try the cocktail bar as the cocktail waitress seemed to have run away but there is a cocktail bar at least. Breakfast was good but nothing extraordinary. Given the price it was a good experience if you not are looking for a central Berlin hotel. My grade is something between a strong three and a weak four but I go for the four as the price was good and I hade a very nice night of sleep in a quiet room and an extremely comfy bed.

<Content>Oasis of Calm I stayed at The Seehof for 3 nights when on business in Berlin. Rooms were on the small side but have everything you want as well as being immauculatley clean. They had an extensive menu and the food was excellent. What was also a real treat was the lovely outside patio that overlooked a small lake, very calming and relaxing after a busy day. One thing I would pick out for special mention was the the staff...they were absolutley superb. Nothing was too much trouble, their English was excellent and every one had a smile on their faces. The reason I stayed here was becasue all the 5 star hotels were full for a big trade fair in town, the reasons I will return are obvious.

<Content>Excellent find I paid 拢50 per night for a double room for 4 nights during June 2002. This hotel normally charges over 拢100 per night, and even that is reasonable for the 5 star accommodation, location and service that you get at the Hotel Seehof. The surrounding area is green and peaceful, yet is only a 7-10 minute walk to the nearest metro, and a further 10 minute ride to Berlin Zoo and the city centre. Fantastic value if you can get it at the right price, if not, worth the standard price alone for a weekend of pure Berlin indulgence.
