<Content>Great Value for the Price Clean Rooms and Friendly Staff!! Stayed at this motel in January 2008, and found it to meet all my needs. It was a good connection convenient to the highway. The room was at a very reasonable rate, cheaper than other budget properties in the area. I had no problems with people hanging out in the parking lot, we asked about the no guests after a certain time period, they told us that was to prevent younger crowds from having parties and is common at motel 6s to have a sign like that. Are room was cleaned daily, and had all needed items, the hotel front desk was able to get us extra towels when we requested without a hassle. All in all it was one of the nicer motel 6's I have stayed at. I would suggest this hotel for anybody traveling in Phoenix and needs a cheaper place to stay.

<Content>Horrible experience My wife and I arrived in Phoenix after a 10 hour drive from Northern Utah. We arrived late at night and were looking for a cheap reliable hotel to sleep in before waking up the next morning for our flight out. We figured that since we'd heard about Hotel 6 we would be comfortable with the arrangements. Little did we know, but the hotel was the most appalling hotel I'd ever been in. Besides being in what seemed to be in a bad location, the staff was rude, the hotel room smelled of something rotting, and the sheets and floor were stained. We both agreed that there must be a better room in the hotel, so we went to the front office and asked for another room. When we entered the next room we experienced much of the same thing and decided to ask for a refund. I know one thing is for sure I will NEVER stay in a Hotel 6 ever again and they should be paying people to stay there, rather than individuals paying money to stay at such a horrible place.

<Content>Where's The Soap?? Well, lets start off with the positives. First, room was fairly clean and did not smell of stuffy smoke or musty funk. The front desk was very friendly, pillows were not flat and the icing on the cake, pets are allowed which makes for a better trip when traveling with your 4-legged best friend. Now, the negatives. Well there was no soap! Nothing to wash your hands with no shampoo, no lotion, no tissues, no shower cap, no alarm clock...nothing. We had to go and buy some soap/shampoo at the local convience store. The towels were very rough, like sandpaper. Gross. Our room, which was reserved was not available, we had to take 2 doubles and the unslightly mold in the shower was an eye sore, the air conditoner was really loud, luckily it drowned out anyone sharing the wall with us and on our way out we saw what appeared to be a pimp yelling at his 'working-girl' while she cried. Nice eh? I would reccomend this place if you are not picky and want to save some money. Just bring your own soap!

<Content>Typical Motel 6--above average service I found this a typical Motel 6, a case of getting what one pays for--not the Savoy, but not a dump. I didn't find the neighborhood particularly frightening, but I'm not a woman traveling alone. I saw no one in the parking lot other than the usual working class types that frequent Motel 6s, and my parked vehicle wasn't vandalized.The lady at the desk was very helpful and efficient in straightening out a reservation glitch that was entirely my fault. If I wanted basic lodging convenient to the interstate in this part of Phoenix, I'd stay here again.

<Content>Sign in the lobby says 'No visitors after 11 P.M.' Not one of the upgraded Motel 6 sites. Clean room but horribly loud air conditioner. Would not recommend for women alone or seniors. Scary people are hanging out in the parking lot. Was surprised to find no damage to our vehicle in the morning.
