<Content>Noisy, noisy, noisy!! I recently stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. It has a good location, right next to the S Bahn station. But the hotel itself I would not recommend. Our first night we were at the back of the hotel, where the mattress must have been in excess of 20 years old it was just a sack of springs, and we itched terribly all night. The guests in the room next door were noisy all night, running up and down the stairs etc. We did complain after our first night and we were moved to the front of the hotel where the room had a proper mattress, but the noise levels were even worse in this part of the hotel.There are no communal facilities, except a kitchen, which you have to pay 1 Euro per person to use each day. Because of the lack of communal facilities the younger people either sat out in the corridors talking to each other, they kept their doors open with the TV blasting out and kept walking from each other's rooms all night long. There is no carpet in the corridors so everyone sounds like an elephant, and you can hear people entering the building a walking up all the stairs from your rooms.Only stay if absolutely desperate

<Content>Berolina in Great Location Hotel-Pension Berolina is in an excellent location----can see it when one gets off at the Charlottenburg stop. Unfortunately, our stay in Berlin was not long enough. As a family of four (2 kids :11 and 15 and 2 adults) we had one room with four beds. Our room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The setting reminded me very much of my college dorm days. My kids liked the free internet access. While breakfast is available, it is not included in the price of the room. The room rates were very good. Every four or five rooms had access to one male and one female bathroom. The men's bathroom had the showers and toilets separate, whereas the women's bathroom did not. If a person took a shower and locked the door, someone would have to wait to use the bathroom. We never had to wait more than five minutes. The bathrooms were cleaned throughout the day.

<Content>Fantastic value This hotel is an unbeatable value. I stayed in a single room that was very cheap (less than 30 Euros) and although it was very basic it was clean and quiet. It is also in a great location, a 15 minute walk into the heart of Berlin and located in a nice residential neighborhood (although the street the hotel is on is not very nice). The room had a small TV which was surprising for such a cheap room, and the bathroom in the hallway was clean enough.

<Content>Great value for money For budget accommodation i would highly recommend this hotel. Good location only 15 min journey into city centre, the breakfasts was good. All in all good value for money. The only thing was it took a little bit of finding but then that might of been my map reading skills. Also check out the Russian shop in the station.

<Content>Great location, low rates We stayed at the Berolina for three nights, in a room for three. Shared bathrooms with three other rooms on the floor. The big pluses are location and affordability. The hostel/pension is almost directlyacros the street from the Charlottenburg S-Train stop making it simple to get anywhere in the central city within minutes. The block the Berolina is on is nothing special, but the nearby neighbourhood is a fairly posh residential area, very nice for walking. And we paid 50Euros per night for three people in our own room, an excellentrate. (We didn't opt for breakfast.)Our room was basic - three single beds, a wardrobe and a small TV, window opening on to a courtyard - but bright and cheerful. Staff were friendly and there is a breakfast available or kitchens for a small extra charge. Great coffee/pastry place two doors down. We were there during the Easter break and the hostel seemed popular withGerman student groups on school tours. They were noisy one evening, but nothing alarming. And there are no elevators, so check on your floor if you have difficulty with stairs. It's much more hostel than hotel, with the option of private rooms. Booking by e-mail was fast and efficient. If you do stay, definitely buy the Berlin WelcomeCard available at S-train stations. It allows unlimited travel and good discounts on attractions and tours.
