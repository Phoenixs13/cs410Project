<Content>Eden Lancaster - okay as a place to just sleep and eat breakfast We recently returned from a trip to Amsterdam, and we stayed at the Eden Lancaster. Our experience there was just okay, but we did have a couple of problems.Location: The hotel is a very easy tram ride from Central Station. Just hop on Tram 9 and you reach the hotel in maybe six stops. It stops one short block away from the hotel so it's very convenient. It costs 1.6 Euro per person. The hotel is a very easy walk to the huge shopping areas, the Jewish museum, the Botanical Garden, the Artis Zoo, and a few other attractions. It takes a while longer to reach Dam Square, the Red Light District, and any of the other sights. I would say it was easily a mile or so to walk to any of those--very manageable if you are a big walker. It seemed like a safe, quiet area because it was far enough away from the main attractions.Check-in/Concierge: It was fine. We arrived just before noon. The only problem was that, during our three days there, there were very very few times when people would be out at the concierge desk. It often looked deserted. They did have a large bell that needed to be rung because it seemed like most of the employees chose to stay in a room in the back for the majority of the day. When we had questions, it always seemed like we were bothering or interrupting them from being in the back room. Also, we had some questions about taxis and airport shuttles, and the employees gave us some incorrect information--which surprised me because I figured that it was something they should know.Room: It was on the small size but it was nicely decorated in modern-looking and sparse furniture. There only seemed to be room for the closet and the bed, but that is fine if you don't plan on spending too much time in the room anyway. Not too much room for luggage! The room did contain many great magazines on Amsterdam; some of them had coupons with savings for tourists, which was nice. The room was cleaned every day and kept in good condition. The bed did sink lower on the side toward the bathroom.Bathroom: The bathroom was the biggest problem for me because it was tiny. Two people could definitely not fit into it. The toilet ran every time it was flushed, and we found ourselves jiggling the flusher every time until it stopped running. In fact, it was running when we first checked into the room. I never quite got the hang of it even after three days. Also, the light stopped working on the first day we were there. We called in about it and someone came in and jiggled the light a few times before it started working again.Breakfast: It was nice that the breakfast service was available for long hours. They did a nice job, offering a good mixture of hot and cold items. They had things like pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.Amenities: The books in the room said that free internet was available in the hotel lobby, but the computer was broken the entire time we were there so we never got to take advantage of it. The wireless available in the lobby was also very slow.Transportation: We chose to take the tram back to Central Station for 1.60 Euro and then we took the airport shuttle back to the airport for about 4.50 Euro per person. It didn't take too much time and seemed very convenient.

<Content>Good location, lovely staff Stayed for one night on 24 hour layover in Amsterdam. Super easy to get to hotel, train into town and one tram from central station. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with postcard issues and arranging ride back to airport in the morning. We bought the tickets from the hotel desk and they called for the pick up. The room was a little bit of a disappointment. There is no lift to the bottom floor (daylight basement). There was a lift at the back that went part way down but then there was another half flight of stairs. The room was at the front of the hotel so we had bars on the window and a view of knees as people walked by. Being under reception we also had quite a bit of noise between the street and hotel patrons until midnight or so then it dropped off. Still noisy,but not unbearable. The bathroom was not in the best of repair. Some of the trim was falling off and the tiling was old and slightly damaged in the shower. It just didn't feel like it belonged in the same hotel. The bed was comfortable though, and the room was well designed. For one night it was OK. If we had been staying another night I would have requested a different room. That all being said, the staff was amazing. I would recommend this hotel, just not this room.

<Content>Nice Hotel during Cool Weather The lancaster hotel is located near the Artis zoo so it is a plus if you have kids, it is also located in the center of Amsterdam only three tram stops away from Rembrandtplien where you can find restaurants, shops and cinemas. The tram costs 1.6 euros and it is valid for one hour only. From the central station I took a taxi to the hotel which costs 20 euros. I took a standard double room booked from the hotel website, the room is good for only two persons, if you have kids then you need a bigger room, there is almost enough space to walk to the other side of the bed. The room has a toilet next to a sink next to a shower all inclined in one row 鈥渃ompact design鈥?which will be perfect if you are in an airplane not a hotel. There is no shower gel so you have to bring your own, they provide with the room a small soap near the sink to wash your hands and excellent two pairs of towels for the face and body. The shower is perfect however you should be careful the HOT water is extremely hot so if you have kids they have to be supervised when using the shower or the sink. The room is clean and comfortable you can have a good night sleep here without interruptions or noise since the area is quite at night. There is a small safe in the room located in the closest which is enough for valuables to keep. If you have kids then be careful when leaving them alone at night watching the TV 鈥渓ocal channels鈥?is not PG anymore even the free channels are not for kids, maybe possible to lock these channels at the reception desk. There is no mini bar so you can鈥檛 cool your water or other beverages you have. However, there is a vending machine in the lobby that offers cool water and other beverages. In addition, there is a nearby caf茅 which I use to get breakfast also dinner named 鈥渃af茅 kroosje鈥? For dry cleaning and washing your clothes, I used the clean center near the Heineken factory they charge per kilo for washing and for ironing they charge extra however they are very cheap compared to the hotel rates for dry cleaning. To reach the clean center take tram 10 after you walk south from the hotel leave the zoo to your left and walk until you find the tram 10 stop and then take tram 10 and stop at weteringschans then walk south until you reach the Heineken building and then you find the clean center on the Fredbolstr. Street. Finally, the windows should be left open to have air refreshes the room and during night you have to leave the windows open since it gets hot in the room without AC but be careful to switch any lights so to avoid mosquito entering your room. I will definitely stay at this hotel again only during winter times or cool weather, I will not stay here in the summer since there is no AC in the room.

<Content>Almost a good hotel. The location of this hotel is okay for Amsterdam. We were able to walk to the main attractions. Our room was modern and spacious but with a rather small bathroom. I appreciated seeing an elevator. We had no problem with fleas.Upon arrival we inquired about parking and the desk clerk insisted we had to pay $50 (USD) to park in the city and he could sell us the parking pass. Upon asking a police officer on the second day he said we could of parked 2 blocks down the street and it would only cost us $7 because it was outside the city. I wish they would have offered us the choice.The night clerk needs to make rounds on the various floors. At 2 AM in the morning in 2 different rooms, adult men had their doors open and were playing loud music and singing. The noise did stop after the desk clerk received our complaint.

<Content>Small rooms but good value Just spent 3 nights at this hotel and overall, was pretty satisfied. Yes, the rooms and the bathrooms are a little tight on space but everything was very clean is decorated to a good standard. It takes about 10 - 15 minutes to walk to Dam Square but it is a pleasant walk with lots to look at on the way. If you can get a discount or special rate, this hotel is definitely recommended. Very nice staff too. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>located near the Zoo A very small hotel in a good location close to the zoo. The bathroom was very very compact and would not suit a large person. The shower was good however. Rooms equipped with tea and coffee making facitlies although they did not clean the cups or replace them but you could get more from the reception area. This hotel was right next to the zoo which was a fantastic zoo and within wlaking distance of the Rambrandt square. It was on a tram line number 9 and 12 but the walk into the centre was very pleasant. Breakfast in the hotel was expensive 15 Euro each compared to the choice you had quite locally so would recommend you ate out. The zoo nearby is well worth a visit - reduction of 4 Euros after 3.30pm - 17.50 normally but well worth it.

<Content>Best Budget European Hotel I've Stayed in! I stayed here during a group tour of Amsterdam, and I must say I was quite impressed.The location of the hotel was perfect-- not too close to the seedy downtown, but only a 15 minute walk from Dam Square and other sights-- not too close, but not too far away.The room was very nice-- probably one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever stayed in! The shower was great, and the size of the room was definitely adequete-- no more space was needed. Great TV and in-room amenities as well.The breakfast was fantastic! It was the best Continental European Breakfast I've had on one of these trips (8 trips, many different hotels and breakfasts). Lots of choices-- meats, eggs, pancakes, various breads and spreads, juices, coffees, pastries, etc...I thought it was great! Highly recommended!

<Author>ultravox
<Content>nice hotel, quiet location, small room I'm a solo traveler who stayed at the Eden Lancaster in January. The hotel is located near the Artis Zoo on a moderately quiet street. My room faced the street and the first thing I noticed was the trams that pass the hotel all day. Luckily, the windows are thick and cut out a lot of the noise. The room that I was in was very small and had barely enough room to store my luggage. The bathroom was as small as it could be, maybe 6 ft by 3 feet, but spotlessly clean. There is a safe in the room and a television mounted to the wall. The room lighting was good and for Amsterdam it was well ventilated and seemed to be well insulated.Also, there is a convenient elevator for use. The breakfast was probably the highlight of my hotel stay. It was very good and had about everything you could imagine, from yoghurt and fruit, to a variety of rolls and bread, to cold cuts and cheeses and cereals. There is a nice coffee/espresso machine as well as a juice dispenser which also included a strange orange colored vitamin drink which doesn't do much for a hangover. Speaking of that, beer in a Dutch restaurant runs e4.50 for a pint sized choice so a nice option is to walk to Waterlooplein, about 10 minutes away, where you'll find a large supermarket (Albert Heijn). The supermarket has a wide variety of beer for a fraction of what you would pay in a restaurant. This is the lead in for the low point of my hotel stay. I went out for the day and left 3 beers in a bag. When I came back to the room, the bag was gone and one beer was left on the dresser. Point of that is, if you have anything of value and you can fit it in the hotel safe, don't hesitate to do so. Now that I ripped the house keepers, I do want to say that they changed the towels and made the bed every day during my 5 day stay so I thought of the missing beers as a sort of tip. On to reception. The check -n was great. The room was ready when I arrived at 10:30 a.m. The nightstaff at reception were aloof, on the other hand, but I didn't have to deal with them that much. The hotel is quite far from most of the action. If you are a walker, like me, then the only thing you have to worry about is the elements. January is actually a good time to go to Amsterdam but it certainly does rain. One good thing about the hotel's location is the nearby restaurants. Like a previous poster, I also recommend Pasta Villa, located one block toward Waterlooplein. It has good, reasonably priced Italian food. Another good thing about the location is that there are plenty of small convenience stores near the hotel. The area is quiet and has a safe feeling. I saw parents with children out and about, something that you eerily don't see much of in most other parts of the city.Other than the zoo, another unique, closeby and must see attraction to visit is the Flea Market at Waterlooplein on Sundays. The hotel is a bit of a hike from Centraal Station. It took me about 30 minutes but if you aren't into walking there is a tram stop less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel. All in all, I would stay at this hotel again. Enjoy!

<Content>Great Place To Stay We came back from Amsterdam last weekend, we stayed from 25-27th August. We arrived in Amsterdam very early on Saturday morning and arrived at the hotel at 9.50 and asked to leave our luggage as the ckeck-in was not for a few hours, to our delight they allowed us into our room there and then!The room was 004 and on the basement level it was clean, comfortable and had Sky T.V and a good shower. There are two types of people who shoud not go to this hotel, groups of lads wanting to be right in the action (as dam square is 10 minute walk) and people wanting 5 star standards. In conclusion for the price the hotel has great service, is clean and in a nice area.P.S If your looking for a nice Italian Maria's in the South of the city is great and half the price of Italians in the red light area.

<Content>safe,great staff, decent value for Amsterdam The hotel is in the Plantage area, which is nice  green  quiet compared to downtown Amsterdam. The staff are super: very nice  eager to make your stay pleasant. The room was fine though small,  had a nice flat screen TV. Walls are THIN and lots of guests are in Amsterdam to party, so I did not get much sleep. What other people wrote the plumbing I found to be true also: the toilet ran ENDLESSLY unless I shut off the water,  the shower spilled all over the bathroom floor. But truth be told: I was there for a conference, and comparing notes with other people whose hotels were in the same price range, I felt REALLY LUCKY. The fact of the matter seems to be, unless you want to pay $300+/night, your choice of accommodations in Amsterdam is quite a mixed bag -- and the Eden Lancaster is not at all a bad bet.

<Content>No Real problems After reading the very mixed reviews of this hotel - some saying it is fine - others saying it is awful - i was a little apprehensive as to wether it would ruin or stay.Well it really does depend on you expectations. if you were expecting a very grand, large spacious room with lots of facilities then this is not for you.It is basic and clean. the room is small and a double is 2 beds pushed together. the bathroom is a bit small too and there are no tea and coffe making facilites. This did not make a difference to us as we only used it to sleep in and wash. it was fine as a place to stay if you will be doing a lot of sightseeing and are about town all day - but if you like your creature comforts and little homely touches - then this is not for you.

<Content>Awful There are no redeeming characteristics of this hotel. The location, while not a bad neighborhood, is out of the charming canals. The lobby and the rooms reek of smoke. I was first given an uninhabitable room with two beds shoved in a space that could barely have had one. The shower did not work. After complaining twice, they gave me a room where the shower actually had water but the drain didn't work and the shower curtain wound around my body. To top it off, breakfast was not included and there was only internet access in the smoke filled lobby. I found another hotel and checked out.

<Content>Decent Hotel at great city rates We arrived at Schipol Airport and took a train to Centraal Station. Easy to get to. We then took a taxi to the Hotel, it was 13 euro.The Hotel is located to the south side of the zoo, about a 20 - 30 minute walk to the centre of the city. Nice to dander into town on a dry evening. However, we bought 3 day tram passes at reception, 13 euro each, so we could hop on and off as we pleased. This suited us fine, as we returned to the hotel at teatime before going out for the night. A taxi back to the hotel after 11pm cost us less than 10 euro on each occasion we used one.We arrived at check-in time, to be advised that our rooms were not quite ready. We were dealt with politely and were able to check-in after a 15 minute wait.The bedrooms are small, about 3m x 3m, and the ensuite is tiny - about 1m x 2m. So previous reviews are accurtate in that respect. I'm on the large side myself, 6'2 and I had no issue accessing or using the facilities - just know to expect this. The bedroom facilities, as with any Best Western, are pretty good, including free room safe, multi channel tv, phone and internet (though we did not use this). The bathroom did not have a facecloth. Besides being well equipped, our rooms had views over a small park, and were clean apart from some minor marks on the carpet.We did not have breakfast as we were never up in time and it was 14 euro extra. Plenty of dining options around and about, typically less than 10 euro for a full cooked breakfast.We took evening meals in and around Amsterdam, and found it to be priced a little on the higher side than at home in Northern Ireland, so as a city break destination I suppose it compared fairly favourably.There is no bar facility in the Hotel, so drinks were purchased from a vending machine when we returned in the evenings and fancied a night cap. The staff were helpful and well presented.Amsterdam itself is a pretty city with a very continental, cosmopolitan feel. Lots and lots of canals, more than you might imagine, look out for the cyclists and listen for their bells - get out of their way because they will not stop if you are walking in a cycle lane. Check out the shops around 9 streets, and the open minded should take an early evening walk around the RLD - just to see what goes on. It really is mad. Be careful though; plan your way and look after your belongings as there are some undesireables hanging around.We had a great break, even though we stayed three nights we could have used another couple, so we will return another time. I would have no problem staying at BW Lancaster House again as it offered good value for decent, if cramped facilities.

<Content>A little basic but all you need I recently stayed at this hotel with my partner and 2 friends. We arrived quite late on a Friday night and walked from Central Station. It is quite a distance but we did not feel unsafe at any point in the neighbourhood. The hotel is to the East of the city centre but we did not find it a problem walking the 20mins into the centre. There are some very nice bars and restaurants across from the zoo which are well worth a visit.The only down side was that whilst our rooms were on different sides of the hotels we were put in the basement so it was not possible to open the windowds to cool the room down and you could hear the trams so a good pair of ear plugs would be advisable if you are a light sleeper. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room generally ok though you could both sit on the toilet and have a shower at the same time as the bathroom is so small.The hotel is perfect for those on a buget but not really for anyone who is after any pampering.

<Content>Lacked some facilities Just arrived back from the Lancaster Hotel Amsterdam with my partner,We were greeted by some lovely staff, who spoke very good english,The batroom was extremely small, and if one needed to sit on the toilet, there was a good possibility that you could hit your head or get your knee's jammed against the tiled bathroom wall.When having a shower, there was a small piece of wood seperating the shower floor from the rest of the bathroom, and if you stood under the shower for five minutes, you have to switch the shower off, let the water go down and re start the shower, otherwise the bathroom was flooded.The hotel bed room was small, but had clean comfy beds, there were no tea or coffee making facilities which if you like either you were stuck unless you wanted to go downstairs and pay about a euro from one of the vending machines.I found the distance from outside town a problem, the town of Amsterdam is quite, so a more centrally located hotel would be better.

<Content>Stay away from this dive This hotel was one of the worst we ever stayed in. Even though the rooms are small and dismal with old stained mattresses and dirty sheets, they still charge as much as a 3 or 4 star hotel. The breakfast was an extra 14 Euros per person and not worth it. This hotel is definitely the worst Best Western we have seen. It doesn't even deserve a Best Wester title.

<Content>Horrible experience Me and my husband booked a room via Opodo - we only stayed for one night but it was enough! We went to this hotel as we thought Best Western meant quality. well, we were wrong. The room is tiny, the wallpaper dirty, the carpet worn. But most of all, the bathroom is incredibly small, there is no actual shower - only a curtain, and sitting on the toilet leaves only 2 choices: either hitting your head on the door or on the sink. The heating was not working in our room and we were simply offered more blankets, no apologies, no nothing!!!DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL

<Content>Truth about Best Western Lancaster The Truth about Best Western Lancaster Hotel.This is NOT a nice hotel. We paid $135.00(USD)for this hotel and expected alot more. DON'T BE FOOLED, BREAKFAST IS NOT COMPLIMENTARY!First of all, it is not close to the main attractions of Amsterdam at all. At least a 20-30 minute tram ride each time. Second, the hotel is not very nice. Our room was in the basement and was very poorly designed. The bathroom flooded into the bedroom everytime you took a shower. There was no control over the tempature, so the room was very cold. When you check in they tell you all about the wonderful breakfast they serve the next morning and make no mention of a price. When you go to the breakfast there is no mention of price. When you check out however, they charge to your credit card all visits to thr breakfast buffet 14 $euro per breakfast. So ... Go get a dutch waffle, way cheaper and they taste better. The lobby area is a joke and the internet they provide you at the hotel is $5 euro for a half hour. Do, find yourself an internet cafe where you can spend $1.50 euro for a half hour.My advice don't stay here unless you get a really great deal, like $60 dollars a night for a double room (2 twin beds pushed together).

<Content>Credit card theft Checked in here for one night in February 2006. They swiped my Amex and I went to bed - room probably the smallest I've ever slept in but very clean and nicely laid out. Next morning checked out, with no extras to pay for and went to my meeting then flew home. When I get my Amex statement I see that I am supposed to have made two telephone calls totalling eight minutes and costing 拢50 odd pounds! The calls were made in California apparently and charged to my card. Reported to Amex who are investigating but if no luck with them it's off to the Dutch police.

<Content>fairly decent hotel  Not a bad hotel at all really, in the end you get what you pay for, 拢40 a night in my case (bargin). Good location just slightly out of the city centre, nice and quiet but is a slight walk to some places, can't be bothered to walk, get the tram it stops outside and get a taxi back at the end of the night if staying out late. (beware taxi's out there will rip you tourists off. my advice ring up for a taxi (tulip cabs are good)  get a price on the phone and never go with a taxi from outside central station, you have been warned. Anyway the hotel gets an average review because it did no ecceed my expectations. Nice comfy beds and everywhere was nicely maintained and cleaned though.

<Content>Stay in this hotel! The title of this review says it all. a great hotel. My partner and i arrived in this hotel at 3pm, we were greated by a friendly man at reception who spoke great english and he booked us in in a matter of minutes and we made our way to the lift. The rooms where not very big but very very clean and warm even with the radiator off and the cold dutch weather outside!! The hotel seems to have been recently refubished and its very new but still retaining some of its old charm. Beds are the most comfortable i have ever slept in. It not right in the city centre but thats good as amsterdam can be quite noisy so dont worry you will have a great nights sleep in this hotel. From amsterdam central station u can buy a 1,2,or 3 day pass which will get you unlimuted transport on trams buses and subway all round the city and there is a tram stop almost on the door step of this hotel so its so easy to get about as they come along every 15mins or so. There is a lack of a bar in the hotel which might put some people off but hey there is no shortage of bars in amsterdam so why would ya wana stay in your hotel when you could be out exploring! There is also a very good chinese resturant just round the corner which is very cheap. ok well all i can say is please if your visiting amsterdam then this is the hotel to stay in, il definatly be back in it again.

<Content>Very pleased Loved the hotel's situation - the area is very quiet and peaceful, yet only 10 to 15 minutes' walk from the city centre, or about 5 minutes on a tram - which are great for getting about on, and there's a stop just down the road from the hotel on a route that goes direct to Centraal Station.We stayed for 3 nights, and although our room was quite small, it had everything you need - the bed was wonderfully comfy, the shower was efficient and the water was hot. What we liked best was that it was quiet, so you could get a decent nights' sleep - what more could you ask?The staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the breakfast, although continental style, does include cereal, fruit, toast etc, so there's always something to eat. Our only criticism is that there is no evening meal available. We did a lot of walking in Amsterdam, and it would have been nice to have the option to eat at the hotel. Having said that, there are at least 3 eating places literally moments away, if you can't face the journey into town, so it's not a major issue.We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>some problems i was in amsterdam in 17/19 august and i have booked at lancaster the package with 2night 120euro in a single room and 2 night 140euro in double...the price is very good,location not bad,then they give me breackfast included in price...but i have asked for quiet rooms and i had a room very noisy on street,my room was very poor and little,not more then 6metres,incredible!i have parked my car in street for 30,60euro daily,so you can understand that amsterdam is not cheap....the hotel was cheap but not good choice for me,may be they have rooms much better and sell the little and poor rooms with special offers.this hotel is a choice if you want pay little,not if you want a beautiful place.

<Content>Great Hotel There is absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel.It is very clean, the rooms are nice and the staff are very friendly.It is a little bit out of the centre, but the trams are fantastic. Catch a 9 or 14 into the centre (they come along every 5 mins or so).
