<Content>cheap but potentially very noisy The Madras is cheap and clean but if your staying in a room on the noisy side of the hotel you won't get any sleep. Especially not in the weekends. We had to put up with some Indian singer going at it 'till 3 am. The breakfast is toast and jam in the basement. So if you stay here, request a quite room and you'll be just fine. We paid about a 100 Singapore Dollars for a double room per night.

<Content>Great location in Little India I have been staying at Madras Hotel in Singapore regularly since 2000. Good location in Little India close to vegetarian restaurants. Rooms are clean but spartan. Bathrooms have great hot water with excellent pressure. For clean cheap accommodation with great location cannot be beaten. Don't eat breakfast at hotel. Go to Komala Vilas for dosai or idly. Avoid ground floor rooms as these tend to be used on an hourly basis by local working girls.
