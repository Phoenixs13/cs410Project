<Content>Don't stay at this hole!!! This place was dirty and gross. We had reservations, when we arrived, we had to wait 1 hour to get into our room. The room was very dirty, walls had spot paint all over that was different colors. The shower dripped. It smelled. There were homeless looking guys going into the laundry room downstairs with employees, then coming out a minute later, looked like drug deals going down. The owner/manager offered us a ride in his limo to the baseball game for whatever you want to pay me. The limo was trashed with trash in the back. We took the ride and gave him $20. The ride was 2 miles and now I found out he charged my credit card $120 for the limo ride. The place is a nasty little place in the middle of a bad part of the city. The staff is sketchy and scamming me money. I don't recommend this scuzz hole to my worst enemy.

<Content>Avoid This One Older unimproved motel in middle of industrial area. Staff friendly but incompetent. Paper thin walls and ceilings so hope for quiet neighbors. We had quiet for a couple of nights and got no sleep for the next two nights. Looks like they are trying to fix up the rooms, but are taking their time about it. It is pretty close to downtown area, but there are better choices.

<Content>Cheap with clean sheets but scary neighbors! Sheets were clean, toilet and sink were clean but shower needed bleach to clean the tiles. Blood stains on the living room curtains of the room was groce. Carpets are old and need replacing. Older building means you can hear every step people above you take, so get a 2nd floor room for sure. Looked like a lot of hookers and drug dealers in the parking lot, along with young kids running around with dirty clothes and bare feet (mother nowhere to be seen). Guy fell asleep with his car door open and stayed that way the entire night (rough night, huh?). If you can overlook all the scary people that frequent the place, it is AN EXCELLENT LOCATION and EXCELLENT PRICE for the money. Friendly staff, although we requested 4 separate times, including to the cleaning staff, that we not be disturbed, to no avail - very poor coordination of instructions obviously. No bugs, no bad smells, so I can say I have stayed in worse places, unfortunately. If you need to be close to downtown Seattle on the cheap, go for it. For $55 a night, it was the cheapest thing around with vacancies. Seeing as other hotels started at $120 a night, this was our only option - and we left safely and without incident, so could have been worse. If they would remove the furniture from the parking lot and the garbage thrown in the flowers - along with all the scary people, it might have a chance, who knows.

<Content>Rattlin' Rain Gutter Stayed here for close proximity to Qwest Field for a game. It rained all night  the water must have been pouring off the roof right onto the wall mounted air conditioning unit right above the bed. It sounded like water beeing poured on a drum from 20' up. Just when I thought it couldn't possibly get any louder, it rained harder  got way louder. To top that off, once the rain let up after several hours the folks in the room above ours got going. Nice squeaky bed! Guess they couldn't sleep either. Not even my earplugs could save me! The folks running the hotel were nice enough, but the place needs a face lift in a bad way, it's in a real industrial part of town and seems to attract the wrong type of guests. Spend another $20  get a real motel room.

<Content>Low rent neighbors I stayed here in August, 1999. I left after one night--- it was too noisy. A family of what sounded like drunken gypsies checked into the room next to mine at midnight and it took them an hour to shower and get bedded down for the night. Then at five a.m. some ignorant hillbilly started up his monster pickup truck right beneath my window and let it idle for thirty minutes. This is also a bad location if you don't have a car---the bus into downtown is heavily patronized by Seattle's sociopathic underclass. Three of the four times I rode it I encountered an idiot trying to stir up trouble.
