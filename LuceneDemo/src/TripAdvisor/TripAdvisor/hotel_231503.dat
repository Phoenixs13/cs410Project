<Content>Great place to stay in Barcelona Everything was very clean and nice in our room and at the hotel. The breakfast was included and plentyful with staff on hand to replenish things. My two sisters and I stayed for 6 nights in a triple room which was supplied with more than enough shampoo and shower gel. They also included sponges, razors and toothbrushes but no face clothes. Your choice if you want new towels daily. The area was very safe even at night. There is a grocery store next door but not open on Sundays. The metro is 2 block away and ATM's are located in any direction from the hotel. All of Barcelona seems to be very safe but always watch your belonings and keep you purse near as there are many people that will pick your pockets especialy in the metro and on the Rambles, we didn't have any problems but did wittness theivery. I booked my stay through Venere.com

<Content>Good value for money Excellent location, very close to metro and bus stops. Supermarket next door.Clean, spacious rooms, comfy beds. Small but smart bathroom. Abundant breakfast buffet.Small kitchenette with some plates and cutlery. No microwave, no teatowel or detergent. Electric kettle would be welcome.We reserved the apartment for three, but we had to repeatedly ask for bedlinen and towels for the 3rd person.Once our room door (next to elevator) was left open by the maid. I must admit, nothing has disappeared from the room.Would stay here again.

<Content>great location just got back from a five night stay at this excellent hotel. on arrival the receptionist advised that if we didnt see the magic fountain that evening then we would miss it completely, he gave us directions and a map pointing out that it was only fifteen minutes walk, he was right on all counts, the fountains are spectacular. During our stay most of the reception staff were helpful.Our room was on the fifth floor, not much of a view ( a basketball court ) but the room was spacious, spotlessly clean and comfortable. The bedding and towels were changed every day and the airconditioning worked!The bathroom was well equipped with all manner of toiletries - razor, toothbrush, shower gel, shampoo,soap.In the kitchen there were cloths and washing up liquid, if you like a morning cuppa before breakfast you will need to take a kettle as its the only thing missing. Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and is available til 10.30am.THeres lots to see and do in Barcelona and this hotel is central with the metro about 200m (Rocafort).we will certainly recommend this hotel and will definately return.

<Content>Loved it. Best value for money This hotel was a lovely surprise. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The apartment was spotlessly clean, large, well appointed with balcony, and had airconditioning as standard. It was very central to everything and the metro was just around the corner - Rocafort. The breakfast also was a nice surprise, hot and plenty of it as long as you get down before 9.30!! I would recommend it highly to old, young and families. Will be booking it again next time I'm up there.

<Content>Basic and Convenient I booked this hotel on Otel.com for a weekend's stay in Barcelona and got a good deal. The room was very basic, but the big plus was that there was a huge amount of space -- in addition to the bedroom area, there was a large sitting area with couch and desk. There is also a kitchenette if you are inclined to cook. This hotel is not centrally located, but it is convenient to the metro and about 8 blocks from Placa Espanya (Aerobus to airport) and Sants station (train to airport). Hotel staff were courteous at best, not especially friendly or helpful. Do not expect any concierge-type advice from them! Breakfast was good and more extensive than at our hotel in Sitges. There was nothing wrong with this hotel or neighborhood, but for tourists like us I would recommend staying in Ciutat Vella or Barri Gotic areas of the city.

<Content>wish we had known better This was a terrible experience for us.our room was not ready at check in, we had to wait in the lobby for about an hour. When we did get our room it had 2 single beds that could not be converted to a double or pushed together. They could not switch us rooms until 2 days later.No one at the front desk spoke any english.The breakfast was OK, not too much to complain about except the pastry's were a bit dry...like day old pastry.The bathroom was dirty, hair and grunge in the tub. They did not replensish clean towels.I cant remember the exact amount but when we were robbed on the beach they charged us an astronomical amount to replace the room key. The elevator is very old and sounded like it was on its last legs.There is a common tv area, but it seemed to be more of a staff lounge then a place to relax for guests.

<Content>Large room Stayed here 13/9/07 for one night. Room 210. Paid 90 Euro prpn BB. Booked through Venere.This was mainly an overnight stop while travelling from Ibiza to France rather than a visit to the city.The location is away from the centre and not near anything specific. But this makes it cheaper to stay at; anything comparable in the centre (eg La Rambla area) would be far more expensive. And public transport is efficient and easy to use, so the location is not a problem.This was an apartment, the room was spacious with good facilities and included a kitchen (which we did not use) and a lounge area within the room. The decor and furniture were rather dated, but still an appealing place to stay. Good air conditioning, good soundproofing from traffic noise.Breakfast starts at 7.30, we had to leave at 7.45 to catch a train. There was an extensive buffet, it was available at exactly 7.30, so we were able to have a quick breakfast in the time available.Barcelona is a pleasant city with several sights, but is very crowded with visitors - we prefer Valencia.

<Author>Mr_Cellophane
<Content>A pleasant surprise I wholly agree with the previous reviewer.We booked one night through Laterooms.com as somewhere cheap to stay between the airport and the train station. We paid 鈧?0 for a room for 3 with breakfast.The room was next to the lift, but as the bathroom and kitchen are between the door and the living area this was not a problem. We didn't use the kitchen, but it could only be described as barely adequate - no microwave, no kettle and few pots and pans. There were a large assortment of toiletries supplied, including shaver, toothbrush and small sponges as well as washing up bits for the kitchen.The breakfast had a huge choice, with bacon, beans, fried and scrambled eggs, breads, croissants and pastries.The room was large, although the third bed took up a lot of space in the sitting area.The only downside, was the distance from the tourist sites. None were in walking distance.

<Content>Well above average 3* Hotel We had a great stay here - the room was good, breakfast was excellent. Generally a good stay.Hotel Location - A medium sized supermarket is to the right of the hotel, several snack bars nearby. The Rocafort metro station is 2 roads to the right, on the grand via. Its a 5-10 minute ride to Placa Catalunya or a 45minute walk.Reception - Spoke good english, very knowledgable staff, booked a taxi for us. Leaflets on tourist atractions in reception.Room - A good size, bedroom area with twin beds and a 'living area' seperated from bedroom by wardrobe with a single bed, sofa and desk. Kitchen had two electric hobs but no oven or microwave or kettle/toaster. Bathroom was fresh and modern, very high standard. Lots of free toilteries too as well as a sowing kit! Some of the furniture is a bit dated but room was spotlessley clean.Breakfast - Good range of hot and cold food served as a buffet. Only downside is not many cereal or fruit. Served in a good sized room.My tips - Very nice staff at supermarket next door - our fave was Carlo Hugo! Not many restaurants nearby so your best off going into the centre to eat.

<Content>Okay but bring earplugs! Hotel just okay.Rooms tidy(ish) .WE found a dirty plate ,knife and fork and bottle of beer in our room when we checked in and someone had obviously had a shower.Agree with other reviewer.Walls very thin.W were woken up every morning at 7am by talking and one time someone having a shower next door!Breakfast ok though if you like continental .Dont expect a fry up here.Quite helpful on the desk.We found taxis very expensive,to the point of rip off.Quite close to main street when we found our bearings.Overall not one of the best we've been to.

<Content>Good value for money Nice apt. Clean and well equipped. No wineglasses and no furnitures on the balcony. Just bring the chairs inside out to the balcony. A good advice; send an email to the hotel before leaving - ask for an apt. on the top floor - back side (not against the street). Sun from 10 o'clock in the morning. And specificly ask for a room away from the lift (a bit noice when people comming bakc at night) Nice but small bathroom - well equipped. Clean. Very nice breakfast - both cold and hot dishes, even chairs for small children. Cosy room. People at the front desk spoke english very vell. Helpfull. Not many restaurants near by. One beautiful on the Gran Via - just turn right from the hotel to the Gran Via - same sidewalk - turn right - just a few minutes to walk. Very anonymous outside - but beautiful inside. Good food, nice staff - main courses 17-27 Euro. Wine is cheap everyhwere. A short walk to Pl.Espana. Take to the right by the old bull ring - a long shoppingstreet - lots of small shops - much cheaper than in the inner city which is very expensive compared to norwegian prices. Take the city tour busses - red and blu line. The blue line from Pl. Espana (stops by the Fira building - you have to cross the plaza comming from Gran via - keep left. - than change routes at the Pl.Catalunia. This is the easy way to see all the sights in a very huge city. 18 eruo p.p. for one day - than you can use these busses the whole day - hop on/hop off. You by tickets on the bus.Taxi from airport in the evening; 25 euro - in daytime 20 euro.the room was bigger than an ordinary hotelroom - aricond. OK - lots of hot water. Not many people at the hotel when we were there - maybe thats why we didnt hear anything from next door - but walls are thin. The hotel is renovating some of the rooms - november 2006 - but no work on weekends.Can recommend this place both for grownups and families.

<Content>Space! Cracking find, this was.We paid a very decent price for a double room and had a room on the top floor with kitchen area, lounge area and a huge balcony! I'm not sure whether we were upgraded without us knowing, but it certainly was worth every penny! The rooms were basic but spotless and the breakfast was decent, too.Pretty good location, too... very close to a metro stop and only 15 minutes walk to the centre.

<Content>good on a budget just got back from 6 nights at aparthotel calabria and overall i must say that it was a decent place to stop for the price. Rooms were kept clean, breakfast was good, location was quite good aswell. The kitchen was good for the main reason that it had a fridge and staff on the whole were friendly and helpful except for one stroppy bat in reception that we had an altercation with on the last day over the deposit on the safe she claimed that she had no record of us paying! The big let down,as has been mentioned a few times in other reviews, was the noise. We were on the main road side where a building is being constructed, so from 7.45 every morning we were woken by the workers! The hotel can't be blamed for this but i would suggest better quality windows be fitted. The walls are also paper thin and every noise from neighbouring rooms can be heard.

<Content>Bring your earplugs! The Apart-hotel Calabria is very basic - for the price maybe it's to be expected. Our first non-smoking room reeked of cigarettes. We were given another room, looking out on laundry and a cement yard. The rooms were roomy but dreary, and you can hear everything in all the surrounding rooms, which kept us awake at night. Breakfast was edible and convenient, the staff was courteous. We sent out two small bags of laundry, asking just for wash and fold, and we got back nicely ironed clothes (except for what was lost), and were charged 60 Euros!! Ask before you send out your cleaning! All in all, we were disappointed.

<Author>bargainal
<Content>barcelona bargain Having just stayed at this hotel for 4 days I can confirm it to be a real bargain if you can bag yourself a special internet price. The location is extremely easy to get to using airport bus to Placa Espanya,Metro 2 stops to Urgell ,Hotel 100 yards. The area was very quiet and safe. we were lucky to get an apartment on the top floor with a huge balcony nice to sit out on with a bottle of wine last thing at night after a hard days sight seeing. There are 2 supermarkets next door but I wouldn't advise cooking on the rings in the apartment as found them very slow to heat up as other reviews have mentioned, however there are a couple of super take away deli's near by. Other reviews mention it being noisey in the rooms, we didnt find this so. The apartment itself was huge with the biggest bathroom I have ever seen in my life complete with all the toiletries you could wish for including shaving set and comb. Whilst it was very clean it has to be said it was a little shabby in parts but that didnt bother us. The included breakfast is very substantial with a huge choice allowing you to completly skip your lunch. Check out is at noon but if you have a later flight out the hotel has a room for you to keep your cases in to collect when you want allowing you complete freedom of movement on your last day. Would definately use this hotel again if we came back to Barcelona.

<Content>Can be better We stayed there from 14 to 16th April. Here are the good and bad things that we found in the hotel.Pros:1. Friendly staff/speak english2. Good location, near Metro Rocafort and supermarket.3. Great breakfast4. Big rooms equipped with a kitchenette.5. Good value for money.cons:1.Hotel had a foul smell!!!(due to pesticide)????2.Rooms can get very noisy at times, since the wall are thin, we were often awaken in the middle of the night3. Rooms were NOT spotless clean, one of the towel had nose [--] on it and were folded carefully for us to use!! Bedsheets were not washed properly, one can clearly see some stain on it. Also bathroom roof had funguss on it!!!!4. There was only 1 coffee machine, which resulted in a long queue in the breakfast room!5. Breakfast starts late in our opinion during weekends at 8am ( while others start at 6am)as a result we missed 1 days breakfast, since we had to catch a bus tour to Montserrat at 8.30!There are few chances that I might stay there again but if i do, then I will defintely avoid room no 211!!!!

<Content>Family of 4 - did the job - would use it again - some service quirks We (family of 4 - 2 adults and 2 ninos (5 and 6 years old) stayed three days in this hotel.To make it short: we found the stay quite pleasant. The room was basic and old, but functional. Nothing for self-indulgence or luxury, but it did the job. Really remarkable is the amount of gadgets the hotel delivers: from soaps, shampoo, razors, sponges, comb, tissues, toothbrush and toothpasta, shoe cleaner, knitting set etc etc was all included and available on the room. I travel a lot but I have never seen another hotel delivering these fast amount of (useful) gadgets.The room was big enough for the 4 of us but could for sure use some refurbishments.Some complains: the hotel does not really cater to business travelers: first, there was no WIFI (but a broadband connected computer in the first floor. And yes, it was possible to reuse the ethernet connection for my notebook...)Second, I could not get the receptionist to deliver documents to a courier (FedEx). I had to wait personally for the courier and hand deliver them.Third, I needed to sent a fax to the US and they wanted to charge 3 Euros per page - the highest fax-sending-fee I have ever encountered anywhereForth, the late afternoon and night receptionist understands and speaks only English when he wants to and was a difficult to deal with for non-standard requests (like delivering documents to the courier).These problems, however, are mostly relevant only for business travelers - and then again, why would they want to stay in this hotel?Only cases like me with some business going on even on family travel run into trouble.Would we stay there again for family travel? You bet.

<Content>Perfect accommodation for family/small groups We spent three night at Aparthotel Calabria last week and were very impressed. We were group of three but wanted to share a room, Calabria met our needs perfectly. The room was very clean, plenty of space and a very modern bathroom, beds made every day and towels replaced. Each morning we were able to start our day with a wide range of choices for breakfast and the dining room was never so full as to be uncomfortable. The reception staff were mostly helpful and the reception area gave a very accurate impression. Although situated on a busy road as long as the window was closed there was no disturbance. At night the room was a little stuffy and we couldn't get the air con working, we couldn't leave the window open because of the noise in the morning! I'm sure with advice of the hotel staff this would have been overcome should we really need the air con. An extremely pleasent experience and I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Spacious but very old fashiones apartments I hosted here 7 nights during december 2005. If you read this during 2006 or later you must know there were on works so the apartments may change.First of all: Barcelona is a expensive city and for the price of the Calabria (in my case 75 euros with buffet breakfast) is a good option, becasue the location is great (a very safe zone between Plaza Espa帽a and Universidad, 100 mtrs from subway stop Rocafort with some restaurants, bars, theaters and cinemas) and you have a small kitchen to dinner if you want (and a supermarket is beside the building).But the apartments theirselves are another thing: although they are spacious (you have balcony, tv room, bedroom, a small kitchenette and a bathroom) they are very old fashioned.We had to change from apartment two times because the conditioned air was broken (and they didn't know) and after cos the kitchen of the new apartment was very... slow (45 minuted to boil water, for instance).Another troubles: the remote control of the TV didn't work so they had to change it and you have to ask de hair drier on the reception desk everytime you want to use it.The staff is not unpleasant but not also very efficient and the parking fares are (in my opinion, excessive -18 euros + 7% VAT each day-. So they are a good chance (for the kitchen, for the location and specially for the huge breakfast) but they could be better. Maybe the works are because they have dettected it and want to make the building better!

<Content>Big Bang for the Buck I spent three nights at the Calabria with my adult daughter. We both highly recommend the hotel. For 65 euros per night we had what would be deemed a spacious apartment in most major cities. Water in the shower was hot, plentiful, and had strong pressure. There was a small kitchen area complete with sink, two hot plates, a fridge, and a supply of utensils. The sleeping area was roomy and had plenty of wardrobe space. Past the bedroom was a sitting area with a desk and comfortable chairs. A sliding glass door opened up onto a balcony. We had an interior room, and it was very quiet at night--no need for earplugs. The rooms were clean, and the service was excellent. Even better was the location. We had a short walk to the Metro (which runs trains four minutes apart and will take you anywhere you want to go in Barcelona),, and there was a well-stocked supermarket adjacent to the hotel. The last pleasant surprise was breakfast, which was included in the price. There was an elaborate spread of ham (serrano and york), cheese, breads, cookies, fruits, cold cereals, scrambled eggs with bacon or sausage, juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate--everything you could possibly want or need to fortify you for each day's adventure. Should I return to Barcelona I would again make a reservation to stay at the Calabria.

<Content>Never Again! If you plan on getting any sleep on your stay in beautiful Barcelona avoid this hotel if at all possible. This hotel was, hands down, the loudest hotel my husband and I have ever stayed in anywhere. While it is true that the hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood it should be noted that it is also right next to the neighborhood parking garage which seemed to be open 24 hours a day. In addition to the constant honking of horns the street cleaners, maintenance crews, and trash trucks start work around 4am. As other reviews have noted the walls are very thin allowing you to hear everything your neighbors do and say. The rooms were fairly clean but very cold, impersonal and in desperate need of remodeling. Fortunately, the staff was very helpful, the breakfast buffet was well stocked, and the hotel is very close to a metro stop.

<Content>My best deal of ever mini apartments for 2,3,4 people well equipped, absolutely clean , large enough and the structure has the quality of services of an hotel. Breakfast s excellent . Moreover, it is cheap and very closed to the central Barcelona. A 4 stars hidden by a 3 stars on the tag! Recommended!

<Content>Clean and simple, but noisy We just got back from staying 5 nights at the Aparthotel Calabria. We read all the comments beforehand and decidedthat the price and location were what we were looking for.We got it for around 80 euros/night given it was duringthe holiday season in mid-late september. The locationwas good, it was in a quieter neighborhood, about 100m away from the rocafort metro stop. There were restaurants, supermarkets, and stores close by within walking distance.As the previous reviewers have said, this place looks likeit's from the 1970s. we had some problems with the bed, the bed spring was broken, but they were kind enough to let uschange rooms. The negatives were: despite switching us to another room, the beds were awful. The walls were thin and so any movement from someone across the floor or next to you you could hear. If you had a room by the main street, you would be woken up all night since the noise is loud and the walls were not thick. We asked for a wake up call on a number of days, but they never called us. we eventually bought an alarm clock or else we would have missed our flight.the showers were hit or miss if they worked.The positives: staff were courteous and nice. they offer breakfast though we didn't have it there. the rooms were clean, practical, and did its job. the rooms were larger than most rooms we've stayed in europe. they had a kitchenette with a simple stove and refrigerator.

<Content>The 3 C's cold, clinical, but clean After reading raving reviws on this piticular hotel, i felt it obligatory to add some honest truths about it. Yes it was in a practical location and very clean, but disappointingly cold, in both terms, temperature cold and atmospherically cold. it was a weird blend of compleatly practical to a shivvering degree. i would only reccomend this hotel if BASIC is what you are after. No soft, cushsi extras avalible. To be fair not terrible, it was very clean and breakfast was good, but it was very true to the word SIMPLE. If a little bit of self indulgence is required on your holiday, then this place should be avoided at all costs, as i dissapointingly found out for myself.

<Content>Avoid this place!!! Have just returned from a fantasic holiday in Barcelona and wish I could go back. When I do return, I'll be sure to AVOID this hotel again. Where do I start?The hotel or apartment building looks deceivingly attractive from their website and listing on Expedia. This is just a ploy to make you think that you are going to stay somewhere nice.Upon check-in, we were told that our room was not ready, which was understandable as it was not quite noon. We asked to put our bags somewhere and was granted this only to have to find our way to some dodgy looking storage room with wires and junk all over the place.Eventually got to the room and were amazed at how bad it looked. It was in serious need of some refurbishment and looked like something out of the 1970's.As we were here for nine nights, we didn't want to make too big a deal of this as it might spoil the mood. But, we were faced with several problems throughout our time there:The balcony door broke on the first day and was impossible to lock. Despite informing front desk of this, nothing materialised and was broken the whole time we were there.The air conditioing system started to leak and there were huge puddles of water all over the kitchenette floor. Also, when turning the A/C to different levels, sparks were coming out of the device.The fridge in the room had some awful smell omitting from it and we daren't put any food in there.When the maids did clear the room, they seemed to forget to make one of the beds and left all the rubbish behind on one occasion. When we first arrived in the room, we found some lipstick and makeup underneath the sofa bed.The floor was filthy and looked like it hadn't been washed in ages. Had to make sure that we had socks or shoes on all the time.Some of the plug sockets were literally hanging off the the wall and are in need of immediate attention before someone electrocutes themselves.Simple request of an iron was met, but no ironing board. How can you iron without this??? Had to use the TV cabinet of all things to iron on.The most important thing didn't work: the safe. The lock just seemed to have disappeared! Nothing was done about this.I'm sure there are other things that my two other friends would like to add to this, but I'll let them write up their own reviews.Overall, the hotel was below stanard for what we paid (and what was advertised). Despite being extremely close to a Metro stop (Rocafort), I would advise anyone to book a hotel closer downtown as the Metro closes at midnight and that means a cab ride and many of the drivers rip you off - that and you're just in such a better location downtown.
