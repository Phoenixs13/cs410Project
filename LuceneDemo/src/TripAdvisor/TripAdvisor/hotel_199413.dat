<Content>great value Hotel We have recently returned from a weekend break in Hotel Imperial Berlin and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for good clean accomodation, great food  choice for breakfast and brilliant location, parallel to Kurfurstedam street (KuDam).,For value this hotel cannot be faulted - we went on the shoppers trip cost 鈧?02 per couple for two nights  it included BB both mornings and one eveing candelit meal - brilliant.We all fully intend to return to Berlin again as we definately didn;t get to see everything we wanted and would book this hotel again no problem

<Content>I agree! Good value, good location. Although I ended up in Berlin during the transit strike, I liked thishotel. Very nice part of town, with some cool places to eat nearby. The room was fairly clean and the bathroom O.K. There were a fewbedbugs. After about 5 days, the strike ended, and this turned into agreat location for seeing the city, with a bus stop across the street, and the U-bahn a block away.I tried the hotel restaurant once, but it wasn't that good. Neither did Ipay for the overpriced breakfast. Much better deals nearby. Also, ask for a room overlooking Lietzenburger Stra脽e, as the rear viewis rather plain. Helpful staff. Hotel computer, (which was oftenbusy).

<Content>Excellent Value in an Expensive City This is a cracking little hotel in a central location.Although it may not look much from the outside, the inside immediately gives the impression of a 3-star hotel with a large lobby and efficient and friendly receptionist. The reception area also includes a computer with free internet access which seemed to be in constant use by guests.Although I had only booked a single room at a bargain discount rate, I was given a double which whilst compact, was clean and well furnished and quite adequate for two people to move around and spend the night in. There was a mini-bar fridge but no in-room safeA buffet breakfast is offered at an extra 拢12 a day, but I declined this and decided to self cater - there is a small supermarket round the corner on Uhland Strasse which is open until 10pm, 6 days a week (although allow plenty of time as it can get quite busy). There are also plenty of Cafe's and bars nearby.The hotel is approx 5 minutes walk from the Uhland Str. metro station which is the start of U-bahn line 1 which runs through the centre of Berlin. The Zoologischer Garden (Zoo) station is about 15 minutes walk away or you can take bus 249 which runs every 10 minutes and stops 2 mins away from the hotel.All in all, if you are looking for a quality hotel in the centre of West Berlin but are on a budget , I would heartily recommend the Imperial. However you may need to shop around on the hotel booking sites to get the best deal (I used hoteldiscount.com which seems to be related to TravelNow.com).

<Content>Reasonable hotel, good base for sightseeing The hotel is what I would expect for the price. Clean rooms, professional reception. The location makes it a good base for sightseeing. Berlin transport is very good. We didn't pay for the breakfast as there were cheaper options nearby.

<Content>Hotel with Great Location! My family and I stayed at Hotel Imperial Berlin and recommend it for others. The location was within walking distance to the bus route, underground train station and many eating establishments. Hard Rock Cafe Berlin was just around the corner. The accommodations/rooms were average in that they were very clean, on the small side, however, the carpets were a bit worn. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast, which can be purchased with the room, was worth it as it provided a wide variety of selections of breads, cold cut meats, cheese and eggs, sausage, bacon and coffee, tea and juices. The rooms were very quiet as we were on the side of the hotel opposite of the street. They had free access to internet, which was unexpected and great to check your emails quickly, as long as you are used to a european keyboard. I would highly recommend staying here for a few days on your next tour to Berlin.

<Content>Imperial good base for Berlin (albeit not very 'Imperial) After wrapping-up business in Dusseldorf last month, I took in an extended weekend in one of my favorite world cities: Berlin (yes, Berlin!). My base was the Imperial Hotel. As has become my m.o. when posting reviews here, I have broken this review down into the Great, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. I will then offer some bottom line / recommendations and answer THE reviewer question (would I do it again?)GREAT# 1 - While there is nothing particularly great about this tourist class hotel, I really love the rate I got two weekend nights at: $69 USD (about E 46 at the time) per night! They have a graduating rate scale at this hotel - whereby the lesser price you choose, the less flexibility and ammenities you get. That WAS great.GOOD# 1 - I really love where the hotel is located - just a few minutes off the Ku'Damm in the very nice Charlottenberg (sp?) area. # 2 - While this is a tourist-class hotel, a business traveler would not be out of place. The staff are professional  friendly and the bar  restaurant area are very nice. # 3 - There is a nice little in-house sauna that is included with your stay (be familiar with attire norms)# 4 - They do a great breakfast buffet that goes a bit over  above most tourist Euro hotels, but . . . it is not included with the room in every price bracket and it is not cheap (E 14)BAD (room for improvement)# 1 - The rooms are typical Euro-small and not very modern. I didn't have a problem (how could I at E 46 / nite?) with this as they are well-cleaned, but be warned if you are picky. I was fine as I was traveling solo, but if you are not, you may feel a little squeezed.UGLY# 1 - The door locking procedure is a potential fire safety hazard and not secure. You get a metal key (that you have to leave at the front desk) that you use to unlock your door, but . . . unless you use the key to lock the door from the inside it stays unlocked! Likewise, if you leave your room you have to lock your door from the outside - just closing it will not lock it. I'm sure people miss that all of the time and I'd bet if you went down a hall and tried doors at random A LOT of them would be unlocked. Worse yet, if you do use your key to lock the door from the inside and can't quickly find your key you could be in effect 'locked IN' - a real fire hazard. BOTTOM LINE / RECOMMENDATIONS# 1 - I feel like this little tourist-class hotel is a good find. Compare similar priced hotels and you will struggle to top it. But . . . come with accurately calibrated expectations (that applies anywhere, really)# 2 - Take at least one night and eat close to the hotel - there are a number of great restauarants between the hotel on Uhlandstrasse and the Uhlandstrasse U-Bahn station (the closest U-bahn stop)A good hotel and solid value - a good base for exploring a great funky, vibey city!e-mail me at jefnac@hotmail.com

<Content>Great Experience We have just returned from a one week stay at the Hotel Imperial Berlin and would comment as follows:The staff were always polite and smiling on the reception desk.Our room was cleaned very thoroughly each day, the bathroom being especially clean. Due to the hot weather our room did get very stuffy at night and with no air conditioning we did open our window, but found it did not help our sleep due to the all-night traffic and people passing by (our room was on the front of the hotel).We had a wonderful candlelight four-course dinner (for a very reasonable price) and cannot fault the service or the chef!The hotel is a short walk to the Kurfurstendamm area with plenty of bars and restaurants, U-bahn and S-bahn stations (both of which we used regularly).We would definitely stay there again. It was moderately priced and other than lack of air-conditioning, we could not fault it.

<Content>Must do better, and so should you With a name like like Imperial Hotel I expected a grand, classy, maybe even slighty luxurious hotel. What I got was an old hotel that desperately needs a makeover. The room was cramped, not all that clean, and neither was the bathroom. The staff, whilst never being rude, weren't particularly helpful either (unlike what I have found elsewhere in Germany)The other thing was the price, for a single room (even allowing for the fact that there was a World Cup game taking place on the same night in Berlin) I didn't get much change out of EUR140, which is just not on. Even for the centre of a big city, this was worth no more than EUR50 per night.Find somewhere else to stay in Berlin, there are plenty of them.

<Content>heavy maintenance needed I guess the hotel provides better rooms and services but I've to evaluate what was my experience and right now I'm having hard times to find anything good to say about this property. The staff weren't unfriendly or rude, just not helpful or welcoming and when you think that this was the best part, you can get an idea of how far this place is from being a good 3 star hotel.The toilette had dark stains that didn't give you the idea of a clean place. I found it almost funny that their welcome card suggests to use the safe, making me assume that there was one in each room. To be fair I've to mention that after having left Berlin they informed me that a safe was available at the desk, but you can guess how useful that info was to me at that point.The worst part anyway, was the lack of air-conditioning in the room, I'm still extremely surprised that a 3-star hotel might have rooms without it. In the morning the room was so hot, that I actually felt relieved once I was in the corridor.The feeling I got is that there are rooms which are nice and clean like the one you see in their site and other rooms which have major flaws, like the one I got (105). If you really want to stay here make sure to get the first ones otherwise look elsewhere.
