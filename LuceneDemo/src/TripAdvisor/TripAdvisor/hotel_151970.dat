<Content>Charming retreat for a day or two On arriving I was disappointed with Casa Grande as it didn't live up to the website photos and the location is not as remote as I imagined after visiting the website.However, the owners and staff are so friendly and charming and the surrounding area beautiful for walks and drives if you are a little independent and adventurous. We hiked in a couple of national parks and along the river but the national park is an hours drive.A previous reviewer had described the accommodations as a step above camping which I do not agree with at all. They certainly are not luxurious but clean and pleasant.I would recommend Casa Grande Mountain Retreat for a day or two.

<Content>Beautiful, peaceful place We spent the first three nights of our honeymoon here. It was difficult to get to, as the website suggests, and we definitely found our GPS to be helpful. The staff was very gracious, but unobtrusive. We also found the guests to be like-minded travelers and very pleasant to be around. Our cabin was lovely and we had gorgeous views of the mountains and had a wonderful time napping and reading in the hammock on our porch. There are lots of treefrogs that croak at night and gecko type lizards everywhere, so if that's the kind of thing that may bother you, this place is not for you. There is not a lot to do, so we spent much of the time napping and reading. We went for drives during the day in search of lunch because the hotel does not serve lunch. There are places on the side of the road, but they do require a drive. The hotel was willing to make you sandwiches for lunch though.The meals were very good. Plenty of options for breakfast. The staff speaks English very well. The dinners were very good as well. The churrasco is excellent, the chicken stew was a little small and the fish of the day was very good. I would recommend the salad as a side.

<Content>10 Million Chirping Tree Frogs - This is a good thing! We spent three nights at the Casa Grande Mountain Retreat in the beginning of July and we could not have been more pleased. If you did your research you already know that there's no AC, phone, TV, newspapers,etc. just beautiful, green mountains and millions of chirping tree frogs. A friendly cat snuggled on my husband's lap while he relaxed in our hammock. If you take a flashlight, at night you can spot huge bullfrogs in the little pool near the office.It's a good idea to take the meal plan. It can get pretty confusing driving around here during the day, I can't imagine driving here at night and not getting lost. We opted for the meal plan and the breakfasts and dinners were good with adequate selection. The dining area was open and cooled with ceiling fans. The owner is a helpful, knowledgeable hands-on kind of guy, working around the grounds, behind the desk and giving morning yoga classes. There is probably some good hiking to be done in this area but In July, it was too hot for us to do serious hiking during the day. The only hike we did was the one loop on the grounds. Lago dos Bocas is right down the road where you can catch a free ferry boat ride to a restaurant on the lake. There is some interesting birding here as well and of course there is a small pool. It is truly a great place to bring a book and do nothing.Although it was hot during the day, at night it cooled down and we had no trouble sleeping with just a fan in our room. We would definately go back. Of the three places we stayed in during our Puerto Rico trip, it was the only place we would return to.

<Content>Relaxing Retreat My husband and I just came back from a stay at this lovely hotel. The staff was great, friendly and attentive. The fresh water pool was a delightful experience, extremely refreshing. The views are panoramic, to say the least. Beautiful!!! It's a very romantic place to stay

<Content>Soooo relaxing The most relaxing place in the world. All you need to do is sit out on the porch of you cabin in the hammock and watch the clouds drift over the green mountain tops. Casa Grande was as blissful the second time as it was the first.

<Content>Just left Casa Grande after our second visit Just left Casa Grande today for San Juan. I already miss the simple tranquility of the place. What a shock to my newly rested system!We requested room 20 at Casa Grande, right by the pool. Some people might not like that, but we did. There's sort of a hedge that provides some additional privacy. We really liked the pool. It was very clean and a pleasant way to pass the time. The hammock was great, too. I got through a mystery novel while swaying in mine! Our room was fine. The weather was nice and warm during the day but quite cool at night - bring a light jacket or sweater in wintertime. The room has no heat, so I was worried we'd actually be cold at night, but it was fine. During the day, the fan and a breeze provided comfort from the hot sun. And don't be surprised by a rain shower or two - the weather changes rapidly here.This place sort of reminds me of a summer camp for adults. Don't leave your room door open or the lizards will pay you a visit! The beds were clean and fairly comfortable. There were a couple of annoyances in the bathroom, though. The drain in the shower was very slow (Drano!) and you had to flush the toilet several times in order to, well, you know...eliminate waste. That didn't seem very green to me, but whatever. Overall, the room was ok. There is no TV here, and they don't encourage radio, so if you need that to be happy, please think twice about this establishment. It probably won't be a good fit for you.The big draw here is the view and the solitude. The restaurant, however, is hit or miss. The breakfast, in general, was a hit! If you like oatmeal, try it here! They make it with milk, vanilla, and cinnamon, and it is luscious. The fresh fruit comes right from their property. Also excellent! They do not serve lunch. The dinner was just ok. I wasn't over the moon about my chicken stew, but the pork loin the next night was delish. My friends ate spaghetti both nights, and said it was tasty. The last night, we went to Utuado for pizza, since it was getting a little pricey eating at their restaurant nightly. Plus, we know a pizza place (Tavo's) in Utuado we really like! We enjoyed the on-site massage by Grace, but we understand she's going back to North Carolina in February. Too bad! I hope they can find someone else to do massage for them, because that is a very nice touch. We didn't try the yoga. We found the staff friendly and accomodating. But everything was pretty decent in our opinion, so we didn't really challenge them! We would recommend the Casa Grande to those who don't mind a bit of roughing it and appreciate the peace and quiet of the beautifult Puerto Rican countryside. We'll certainly return again.

<Content>Warm hospitality, relaxing environment, lush setting My partner and I just spent 3 nights at Casa Grande and were delighted with our stay. The setting was just eye-poppingly beautiful, replete with lush gardens and a tropical mountain background that was the most beautiful landscape we've seen outside of Switzerland. The owners and staff could not have been more warm and accommodating, even to the extent of inviting us to take an introductory class in yoga at the retreat that has inspired us to pursue yoga upon our return (where else do you find that?). We were there at the start of the week, so there were few other guests at the retreat at that time, making for a blissfully quiet experience. I've read some of the other comments on this website and I can imagine that noise might be a problem during more busy periods, but I've found that to be the case in most hotels I've stayed at, even the finest ones... If what you are looking for is a 5-star experience in a top hotel property then this place is not for you. If you want a unique stay in a gorgeous tropical setting where it is quite a feat to provide the comforts we take for granted, then I encourage you to give this place a try. We did and were richly rewarded.

<Content>Not friendly owner My experience was something like the person that wrote the Mixed review. I found the food OK but i got into a big fight (and i don't often) over the price of the two cocktails I had. The bar tender, who was friendly but unfortunately left after making me my first drink, quoted me $5 each. When the bill came it was more like $10 each! The owner would not back down. It really put a damper on my experience at the time. Now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I would go back there if the same people run it and I think they do. Inland PR is beautiful and using a friendly parado near the ancient ball courts is still a good idea. Perhaps there is an alternate small in (Parador) that you can find.

<Content>Mixed Feelings Pros: 1. Peaceful, SPECTACULAR view, not touristy, great for those looking for something off the beaten path2. Best sangria ever 3. Cheap local beer $2 Medella- can't beat that! 4. Friendly wait staff Cons:1. Drive up to retreat was up a VERY long and winding mountain road. 2. There is absolutely nothing around if you wanted to get away 3. The owner was not very friendly- it seemed like we did something to piss him off. 4. BIGGEST CON: The FOOD!! The 1st night's dinner was absolutely amazing. The 2nd night, however, was disaster! They brought out old food- they were trying to reuse some dried up meat they couldn't sell on the weekends. The rice was soooo dry and even cold- I requested they bring out some new rice and I can't believed what happened next. We sat near the kitchen so I heard them microwaving something- then I heard a DING!  the micorwave door opening and closing- and here comes my food. They basically added some water to the rice and microwaved for 3 minutes. WASTE OF MONEY!!!I understand they are way up in the mountains, but that's no excuse to sloppily resuse old food and charge customers full price for it!! The breakfast was also horrible - $7 for a ham sandwich I could have gotten at a gas station. 5. Doors were dirty6. Room was not well kept up (our comforter had a stain on it- I'm sure the comforter was clean  that they couldn't get that old stain out, but get some new comforters!!) If they were not so dishonest w/ the way they made the food, this place would have been good. I'm pretty easy going  will let lots of little imperfections go, but that shady method of business really turned me off.

<Content>Beautiful, Peaceful Casa Grande is remote - making it perfect. It is a bit of a drive but its not terrible - just make sure you go during the day. The rooms are spare but really what more do you need than a clean bed and a private bath? They even provide a fan in each room. The hotel is set in the beautiful mountatins of central Puerto Rioc. You can lie in your hammock and never get tired of the view...especially when the clouds start and settle in the mountain valley. The food, on the other hand is sort of hit or miss. One night our dinner was absolutely fantastic; the next, not so much. Also, there is no lunch service and after making the drive you don't really feel much like driving again until its time to leave. But...do not hestitate to leave the property (turn left out of the gate) and walk about 20 minutes to the Villa de Pescados. It is one of those roadside bar/restaurants that you will see many examples of on your drive to the hotel. The owner/operator of the bar was really nice and we settled in for Medalla beers and some authentic criolla cuisine as it poured outside. The bar looked out over the mountain side as well with more beautiful views. Be a little forewarned though...there are no hours posted so I can't be sure of specific times they are open. We walked by and they were just opening at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon....

<Content>beautiful setting but some downsides I stayed at casa grande in January 2007. The facility is located in a beautiful lush moutainous area, no doubt about that. As advertised the resort has simple, clean, rustic type rooms and the bed was comfortable , with fans (no a/c) but good ventilation. A hammock on your porch is a very nice touch. The pool was quite nice and relaxing in the mountain settting. The major downside to the resort is the cabins contain 3 or 4 seperate rooms in one structure and there is essentially zero noise insulation. The resort caters to families as well as couples and it is basically luck of the draw if you have a completely quiet experience or noisy neighbors,. They do have a quiet time cutoff of 11pm which was respected by most occupants and the soothing coqui frogs chirping was very pleasent. Also be aware the local road runs rigth in front of the resort so occasional traffic passes by. Yoga in the morning was relaxing albiet the occasional truck/automobile would come down the road and create noise. The food is reasonable but not gourmet. Getting to the resort requires navigating hairpin turns through the mountains, but for experienced drivers it is managable. Local activites include some pleasent hiking through lush vegitation with mountain and valley views, a lake with free boat ride which i did and found very pleasent. Horseback riding and kayaking is also available. The owners are friendly and helpful. In summary casagrande is located in a beautiful setting and has simple clean comfortable facilites with gorgeous views from your relaxing hammock. But be aware that noise from your neighbors, and their children may be a significant, albeit unpredictable downside.

<Content>Pleasant, memorable experience I stayed two nights with my wife, my 2-year old, and my in-laws. It was a pleasant and enjoyable experience, and I see myself returning. If luxury, TV, telephones, and AC is what you are looking for, Casa Grande is not for you. If you have an appreciation for nature, peace, and tranquility, then Casa Grande will definitely satisfy. Rustic is the word that would describe Casa Grande. The views are wonderful -- you wake up to a wall of green mountain to greet you. It provides a valley experience, instead of a mountain top experience (which would be even better), but enjoyable and inspirational nonetheless.The first night we were there, the occupancy level was high, so in the morning there was an all-you-can-eat buffet breakfast. The selection, freshness. and quality of the items was very good. The next morning, the occupancy level was low, and a regular breakfast menu was available. The selection was good, and the food was once again, good. The only other food I had was after poor planning, I found myself back at the hotel in the late evening, having not eaten dinner. Steve was gracious enough to accomadate me with a selection of my choice from the menu. It was a stewed chicken selection which was fine. Nothing special, and a little pricey, but still within reason.As far as the price, I have mixed feelings. Part of me thinks that it's overpriced. I paid $110.00 plus tax per night -- $90 double occupancy, plus $10 for each additional person. That's alot of money when you consider that it's rustic with no AC or television. It just seems like it should be less. But personally I love the mountain experience, so I am willing to spend the extra money for the ambiance. That's a personal decision.As far as the lack of AC, I would say it's not necessary. I was not there during the day, but I'm sure it could get rather warm. When we arrived during the evenings, it was rather warm, and you felt hot and muggy, and I felt myself wishing for AC. BUT, after I took a cool shower, I felt totally comfortable. Falling asleep was comfortable with just the fan, and by the morning, it was so cool, that we found ourselves bundled up with blankets.As far as the lack of TV, I would say that it would prefer to have one. Most of us are so centered around the television in the evenings (maybe a bad thing), that it feels awkward and boring without it. That said, we got along fine without it. The hospitality of Steve (the owner), and his staff was great, and topped of a very enjoyable, and memorable experience.

<Content>Relax and rejuvenate at Casa Grande At first when we looked at the pictures, Casa Grande looked a little too rustic, almost like Girl Scout camp on stilts. However, the simplicity of accommodations added to our enjoyment. Casa Grande is tucked away into the mountains outside of Utuado. The coquis chirp a lullaby all night and the roosters awaken you in the morning.Jungle Janes was convenient. Not having to drive after dinner made the marvelous Sangria made from Steve's recipe extra enjoyable. We tried other sangrias after our stay at the Casa Grande but none can compare.We stayed for one very short night and left feeling energized. Would I stay here again? Most definitely!! But next time, the stay will be longer.

<Content>Lovely outside;Questionable within. We stayed a single night here in order to be near Camuy Caves and the Arecibo Observatory. While the surroundings were beautiful, the rooms, especially for the price--$99--were pretty outrageous. I have since discovered that we paid more than we should have for the room, particularly as we were among only about four rooms occupied that night. Had we known what we were in for, we would have sought other accommodation. The food was quite good, BUTThe bathroom was so dirty I could not find a clean spot to put our toothbrushes down. The management argued with us about the need to get it cleaned until I volunteered to clean it myself if they would give me the materials. At that point, they called someone in, who obviously understood the problem as she changed the sheets from the ones we could read the mattress tag through to new ones that were not only not threadbare but also lacked the dirt and spiders that we had had before. I also dislike looking up to see debris caught in cobwebs on the ceiling in a hundred-dollar room. Even after the cleaning, the shower was too dirty to be used without shower shoes. This is okay in a summer camp, not in a hundred-dollar room. We are too old for summer camp, and it's not what we were looking for. If it's not what you're looking for, this isn't a place for you, either.

<Content>great location with potential to improve I stayed for one night at the Casa Grande hoping to use it as a base for hikes etc. The drive there was spectacular and the setting gorgeous but the place itself was disappointing. The place looks a bit ramshackle from the outside. The rooms were very clean, large enough, clean, the fresh mountain temperature did not require air conditioning, but I heard every word from my early riser (5 am) neighbors despite speaking in low voices and every bathroom movement during the night. At 8 a.m. I had the impression that the whole resort was awake but in fact it was just the staff chatting on way to work. Mostly enjoyed the yoga class (additional) and the hammock on my balcony. Did not enjoy the dinner - lackluster and overpriced. Breakfast was fine - decent food for only $7.00. Travelling alone, I had hoped for more input and suggestions about enjoying the area but the management seemed friendly but not helpful with advice. Overall, I would say that it is great place to base some hiking or an interesting night away from the beaches, but do not expect any frills or a good night sleep if you have neighbors.

<Content>Relaxed Atmosphere  Just back from a Thanksgiving break.Casa Grande is in a beautiful, remote setting. You are sleeping in the rainforest and the singing frogs remind you of this.Rooms are spartan but clean. Yoga each morning (optional). Lots of hiking trails abound. Pool is good. Jungle Jane's restaurant was a romantic setting for a candlelight dinner. No TVs or cell phone reception. Staff are all very friendly and helpful. Great place to unwind and just relax, if that is what you're looking for.

<Content>Beautifull view, not so good room's The view's are breath taking. But the rooms are spartan. There is a problem that people fail to mention. The wall's between the room's are very thin. So be prepared to listen everithing that happens in the room next door(Sex,snores, fight's, etc) . My wife and I had a good time but, we would like a more peacefull and private night. So we are not going back.1. Staff: friendly and helpfull2. Food: Great, no need to go elsewhere.3. Facilities: beatifull, only problem are the room's (see above)4.Events: The Joga class is a must.
