<Content>I love this hotel! I have stayed at the Hotel4Youth 3 times during the last 5 years. My most recent trip is the one I am reviewing.The hotel is clean, spacious and conveniently located. The reception is permanently manned, and the hotel is secure after-hours by means of an intercom (or key card for guests) to gain entry.The rooms are all very well designed, with a wardrobe for each guest in the room. Despite so many beds being in a room, it is still spacious, with room for a table, stools and room to store luggage. The rooms don't feel small, and are clean, warm and odour-free!Breakfast is served in the dining room, there is a large selection of items to choose from - the only improvement would be to make breakfast open until later!This hotel is excellent value for money, which is one of the reasons I keep coming back!

<Content>Like staying in a hotel costing double the price. Like staying in a hotel costing double the price. The room and bathrooms were spotlessly clean. The staff very friendly. The location was good. Very quiet at night. Comfy beds. Efficient card system for entry and exit 24 hours a day. Bar open 24 hours. I can鈥檛 recommend this place enough.
