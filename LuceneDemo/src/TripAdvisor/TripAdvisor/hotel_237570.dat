<Content>Heg' Great Hegra was Gracht (Great), wee Herengract hotel Was staying short stay at this canal-side hotel and it is a short walk to central Dam square, Anne Frank house, and really is very well located for exploring the entire city. The hotel is quite picturesque on the outside, it is an old canal house and a most characteristic building indeed. I really enjoyed being a resident in this area, with the canal in front, narrow cobble streets, little hump backed bridges, old black lamp-posts, colourfull avenue trees,....it was really quaint and nicer than I had imagined.Moving inside, and beyond the Hegras frontdoor, the accommodation was overall great value for money, by comparison to other hotels, indeed some being closeby. Breakfasts were adequate and included in the bargain price. The stairs were narrow and steep and not best suited to the less able. I was sent to the top floor and felt like I was in a lighthouse!! sort of impression. Anyways, my small single room was fine, basic and clean. I had nice side-view over the picturesque Herengracht canal and no real complaints. Maybe the small size at times, made me feel slightly, like I was living in sort of caravan accommodation. Bit cramped. Probably the only inconvenience was that my wee room was not en-suite. It didn't cause me too much grief on short stay though. Overall I would return to Hegra hotel and recommend it if your main priority is simply a good nights sleep and on the outside, both a very nice and convenient location.

<Content>Small, friendly, PERFECTLY located bargain hotel We stayed at Hegra Hotel in August 08 for 5 days. Booked the triple room extra. Supposed to be the largest room, which was good as rooms tend to be small at the Hegra Hotel. Window goes to the backyard though, not to the gracht. Equipment of the room was basic, means: no tv or minibar, even lacking a big enough closet to stow away your clothes, BUT the room and private bathroom were well maintained and very clean. Nothing to complain here. Breakfast is basic: bread, butter, ham, cheese, jam and coffee/tea. Have to point out though that I was glad to find a hotel at all where breakfast is included (in this price range, that is ). And thats the most important point: you get a clean and solid room for an almost unbeatable price! And it is totally central near Dam Square!!! The guy at the reception isnt the most talkative person, but he is very polite, friendly and helpful. I would definitely book there again.

<Content>never again at the hegra My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Hegra Hotel in July. We realized from the website that there were stairs up to the rooms, but the description online was a bit of a stretch, It would be more apt to call it a carpeted ladder. Not only twisty and turning, but very narrow. The room was tiny, it felt more like a sleeper compartment on a train than a hotel room. Luckily the temperatures in Amsterdam were cool during our stay, the room had no air conditioning or fan. At night we kept the window open and felt as though we were sharing the room with the people next door. We could hear every word and movement and felt sure they could do the same with us. The breakfast was the most satisfactory part, and that only on the first morning. We had an adequate amount of toast, ham, cheese and an egg apiece. The following 2 mornings however we were given exactly half the portion with the exception of the egg. We found the fellows running the front desk to be by far the most unfriendly and basically unhelpful people we encountered during our entire 3 week trip throughout Europe. On the morning that we were scheduled to leave we needed to depart at 7:30. Breakfast, and apparently the front desk also, were not open until 8. We rang the buzzer (as per instructions on the sign for early checkout) for 25 minutes and not until the linen delivery people came at 7:55 and woke the staff up were we able to check out. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>cute old hotel in beautiful setting Hegra Hotel is a small hotel in a very old building right at one of the prettiest canals in Amsterdam. It is cute and quiet, and I would have given it 5 star were it not for the (well-known) steep stairs...we had one of the best rooms, no. 6 overlooking the canal on the 3rd floor but bringing the luggage up the stairs was difficult. Aside from that minor issue, the reception was always friendly and the hotel a great value!

<Content>please do not misguide people Iread thoroughly almost all the reviews of hotel Hegra before making a booking. The location is very convinient, and the hotel is very clean. But other than that it was not correctly reviewed. First the staircase, its more than steep, its dangerous. I saw two ladies slipped on it as I was checking in. The breakfast was mentioned fabulous,but we didnt find so. when Rob was not around another gentleman was attending to us and we got 4 pieces of bread with just enough of everything and we paid $5/person for it as we arrived early. The toilets are uniquely small and the 2nd floor had a2' *3' w.c. without any shower and the 3rd floor had a shower of the same dimension without any place to change clothes even. But they even economised on the toilet rolls, which really was the last straw.there was no toilet roll in the w.c. I have travelled to many parts of the world and even in Africa we had better toilet facilities . In a plot so small and a building so old I felt it was greedy to have 11 rooms with such poor facility ,in a place like amsterdam where you can get much better room for the same amount. Just because one has an access to internet ,one should not mislead unsuspecting travellers

<Content>Wonderful, fabulous, incredible What a find, the position of this hotel is brilliant, a few minutes walk away from the trams, Dam Square and Anne Frank house.Excellent restaurants close by. Our room was what we expected, small, the hotel was built in the 1600's, but very clean with a magnificent view of the Canal. Quiet position, away from the hustle and bustle.Be ready for steep stairs, especially if you have cycled 20 miles and can't walk!Bikes can be hired from the hotel, no looking around the city for them to hire.Breakfast was typical continental, ham, eggs, cheese, toast and juice. It filled us up for the day ahead, but ham and cheese will be off my menu for a few days!!Very friendly and helpful guys who own the hotel, always available to assist.Had a great holiday here.

<Content>Would recommend The price for the quality was very good. Although you do need to be able to transcend steep staircase(es). The room was small but the view of the canal was nice and the bathroom was clean. The bed was very comfortable. There is internet available for a small fee. The owner is available if you have questions but will not pry or ask many questions of you. The free breakfast was light but was adequate. The location is near many restaurants and nearby most attractions.

<Content>Hotel Hegra Amsterdam Stayed two nights at the hotel Hegra in Amsterdam Feb. 2008. We booked directly through the hotel website.The hotel is located on Herengracht roughly 15 minutes walk from Centraal Station. It is a small yet cosy hotel. The stairs are very steep and if you are tall like me, you will need to almost bend over to fit up onto the third floor!Rooms clean - ours had its own shower. Toilet on each floor. Very quiet hotel.... ideal if you are seeking peace and quiet.You keep the room and front door key on you when you go out. Breakfast is served to you and is tea/coffee, toast and jams, eggs, cheese and ham. Rooms were cleaned daily. Hotel has a very friendly cat. Internet available on site - never saw it being used by anybody else so you won't have to queue - cost 50 cents (approx. 35p) for 10 minutes. Bike can be rented from the hotel. Cheap enough compared to the surrounding hotels. Very close to all main Amsterdam sights.All in all, a good stay for those on a budget visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>A Great Deal in Amsterdam Excellent budget hotel in Amsterdam. This was my 4th visit to Amsterdam. I have stayed in several budget hotels in the city and this was by far the best. The location is ideal. It's close to everything yet located on a more quiet canal/street. The staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was okay. Similar to other European breakfasts I've had (toast, jams, ham, cheese, egg, coffee/tea, juice). The rooms were very small, but that has been my experience in other hotels in Amsterdam. The stairs are narrow and steep. Not a problem for me but perhaps others. There is no elevator. I stayed in a triple room on the top floor. We had our own shower but shared a toilet. The rooms and the facilities were clean and comfortable. I would book here again for sure.

<Content>Very clean and great location! This place was a very pleasant place to stay. It was about a 15 minute walk from the main train station in Amsterdam...that is, 15 minutes weaving through crowds.Outside this quaint little family hotel is a lovely view of the canal right outside your front door. Hotel is extremely clean and well-cared for. The fellow working the front desk is always there and hard-working. He checked us in, always seems to be around either sitting at the front desk, outside sitting and enjoying a smoke, or watching dvds in the living room beside the front desk to kill time. I really feel for him...he is there ALL THE TIME!! He makes a really delicious breakfast in the morning, running around and boiling eggs for people, serving with varied breads with jams, butter. The room itself is super tiny...when you walk in the front door to your room, there is basically 2 twinbeds side-by-side, and nowhere to walk. No exaggeration whatsoever. If you are a person with a small to medium size body frame, this will suit you just fine. It is small...not dirty. Like I said, this place is super clean. If you are a big person and have to have a lot of room, this place will make you feel claustraphobic for sure. Somehow, they managed to wedge a little shower in the corner of the bedroom.The toilet was outside in the hallway,and immaculately clean. The stairway you have to climb to get to your room is killer. Anyone who I saw (including myself) was huffing and puffing trying to carry their luggage up all the stairs (there are a lot of them). The staircase is also very narrow. This is typical of a lot of Amsterdam houses...so don't be turned off, this is normal.Internet is available at this hotel 24 hours a day. Not bad..I think it was 1 Euro for 20 minutes, something like that. Location is only a block or two away from the Anne Frank House (museum).

<Content>A great place to stay in Amsterdam We like to travel but don't like spending a lot of money on hotels. However, especially as we've gained more experience with European travel, we have gotten picky about a few things: Clean, safe, friendly, a good breakfast -- and of course not obscenely expensive. Hotel Hegra excelled on all these counts.The place is spotless and well cared for, not even counting the fact that the building is 350 years old. The location and exterior are as picturesque as you could imagine, though the interior is tastefully 20th century. The neighborhood was very quiet during our stay.The staff (just one man we saw during our entire 36-hour stay) was friendly and helpful. Some reviewers have written of staff not being friendly, but (assuming that it's the same guy) I think they must mean that he's not chatty and outgoing. He's a quiet guy, but he was very helpful to us at check-in, very available to us during the rest of our stay, and helpful with specific information when we and others needed it. If you need chatty and outgoing in order to feel welcomed, then perhaps you'd want to consider another place, but we found no problem with the service. The two hotel cats are friendly, too.The breakfast was nicely presented and more than adequate -- not the selection of items you might find on a breakfast buffet, but very good both mornings and plenty of food to get us going. (Toast, bread, ham, cheese, soft- or hard-boiled egg, coffee, tea, orange juice, and plenty of jams, jellies, Nutella, etc.)The self-service, coin-operated computer with Internet access (50 cents per 10 minutes) was easily accessed in a cubby on one landing and available 24 hours.Reviewers also mention that the hotel and its rooms are small. This is true, but if you're an experienced two-stars-or-less European traveller, I think your reaction will be what ours was: We've stayed in smaller places than THIS. Speaking of stars, I am assuming its one-star rating probably has to do with items such as elevators, in-room phones, in-room TVs, and 24-hour reception -- all of which Hegra lacks, but who cares? (If you do, go to the Holiday Inn!) We stayed in Room #5, one of the less expensive options with an unremarkable view of the interior of the block, but it had a shower in the room and the hallway bathroom has a great canal view which you can go see anytime you need it!Hegra will be our first place to check for availability on our next trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Small typical amsterdam house with great location I stayed there in a single room (with toilet and shower on the floor) just one night in August 2007. the rate was 50 EUR.It is a family hotel that looks like a typical Amsterdam house.I choused this hotel for its very good location( 5 minutes walking from the DAM square and one one of the best canals). If you sit there for a short time and you don't plan to spend to much time in the room except sleeping then the hotel is very good value for its cost.The guys at the reception are great and they personally arrange the breakfast for you which was quite good in fact.Overall the hotel is realllly small.The room I had was on the top floor and it was more than small (I think it had 5 square meters !!!). The shower on the floor is really small and between the door and the shower courtain there is a 15 cm space where you try to put your shoes and clothes and try to not fill them with water.If you plan to sit there for more than 2,3 days it could become annoying but, as mentioned, if you just sleep there its great and I actually recommand it.Wish you a nice time in Amsterdam

<Content>Charming canal house Enjoyed our 3-night stay at the Hegra, with a double room facing the Herengracht canal. The stairs are very very STEEP so beware! That said, this is what to expect if you decide to stay at a 17th century canal house. Hospitality was excellent (price includes breakfast) from both the hosts and the cats (one would come right up next to you if you had meat on your plate). The location is great if you want to see more locals and avoid the tourist hordes, but is only a 10 minute walk to the Anne Frank House in the lovely Jordaan neighbourhood.

<Content>Great Value I stayed at the Hotel Hegra for 3 nights in March 2005. I stayed on the top floor; the room cost me 45 Euro which is ALOT less for just about anywhere else you'd stay at in Amsterdam. My room was small but the bed was confortable. The room included a sink, the toilet was in the hallway and shared by two other rooms, shower was one floor down and shared with that floor. The stairs were extremely narrow which makes carrying bags difficult, even for someone in their twenties. The hotel is ideally located, nearly all major attractions within relative walking distance. A tram stop is less than five minutes away. Breakfeast was included and consisted of an egg, toast, cheese, meat and coffee. Customer Service was excellent. Overall a great value!
