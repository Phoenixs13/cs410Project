<Content>Wonderful place This was a wonderful place to stay! The rooms were very clean, with service and new towels everyday. Others thought the rooms were on the small side, particularly the less expensive rooms, but ours was bigger than expected. Sure, it's smaller than a typical room in the U.S., but for the value, we had a nice bathroom with a full tub and plenty of room for our things. There is a nice courtyard, which makes for quite evenings being off the street. Also, location is awesome: very close to Notre Dame, Pantheon, late-night cafes and bars, and metro. Front desk folks were very nice on arrival and departure. We didn't have breakfast as there are plenty of places around to grab something to eat. However, we saw plenty of other folks enjoying themselves in the morning. We would most definately recommend staying here and look forward to returning soon!

<Content>First time to Paris This charming hotel is tucked away behind tall gates on the Rue de Cardinal Lemoine. A small sign is the only thing indicating its presence. Upon opening the gates, one finds oneself in a lovely garden courtyard. Very welcoming.While our command of the French language certainly improved during our stay in Paris, we were initially hesitant and unsure of our communication skills. The hotel staff were most gracious and helpful in this regard. They encouraged our attempts at French, but were also very capable of helping us in English. We soon found ourselves in a delightful, third floor room with a beautiful view of the courtyard below.The rooms are small, of course, and very clean. The beds comfortable. There are no televisions, no radios. It was explained to us that this is because the hotel is very old, and the noise would be potentially disturbing to other guests. The bathrooms are clean. Some have tubs but most are shower equipped. Toilet paper was sometimes insufficient and you might want to bring your own Kleenex as it seems to be scarce in Paris. Location is good. Latin Quarter is charming and bohemian. Walking in the neighbourhood is a pleasure. Metro close by. Patisseries on many corners. Incomparable pastries. They truly are works of art!!

<Content>very good The hotel is very cute. Quartier latin is a good place for tourists. There's people of everywhere in there. Asians, europeans, latins, russian, africans. It's a mix. A facility to the brazilians: Marie, the proprietary, is portuguese. There is a street near the hotel with several (thousands) restaurants. On the Cardinal Lemoine there is a very good turkish restaurant. Backing to the hotel, the rooms are not luxurious and very adorned, but have a simplicity that I like. I liked too that there wasn't TV on the rooms. The bathroom is okay. There is not a shower, just a bath. The bed is good. Just a problem on the room: I am atopic, with allergic rhinitis and suffered a little with sneezing, stuffy nose and tearing eyes on the 4 days we stayed there. I had to buy a polaramine to stay in the room. The price is good, worth the money.

<Content>enjoyed the area Have not stayed in this area before, usually in the st. Mich area or Opera but I found it very interesting to be in a place that also had plenty places to eat and drink but we found the prices inParis sky high and not just because the pound is weak against the euro.The hotel was very nice, large clean room but it suffers from nowhere to be in the evening, not everyone wants to be out all the time.Staff were helpfull arranging journey to airport .A little Toile de Jouy goes a long way! twinkie

<Content>Charm, location, and a warm staff. After reading several magazines and newspaper articles on small boutique hotels in Paris, I picked this hotel for our last two nights. We needed two beds, and was told they would accommmodate us, albeit we must change rooms.Juliette was wonderful upon our check-in - very helpful and friendly and she speaks great English! She was truly helpful to us! She even gave us specific instructions on how to get to a great restaurant in the 7th using the metro. Salome was wonderful too.The rooms have typical French Provincial wallpaper. The first room at $138 E. was spacious and had a comfortable bed. We had to make up the second bed sitting outside our door, though. The second room, at $118 E was much smaller and the bed was not as comfortable. Both were facing the courtyard and were fairly quiet except for the sound of suitcases rolling down the cobblestones. Bathrooms are newly renovated and nice, but with very narrow and short bathtubs. The room in the main building was served by an elevator, but pulling a suitcase up 33 stairs in the front building was not fun!We did not take their breakfast (8 E.) as there were several nice bakeries nearby. Also nearby were two metro stops, so you can get anyplace easily!The reservation process was easy and I heard back from them via the internet right away.Note that if you want coffee in the morning, it is $3 E. A lady from New Zealand had her own coffee and they provided hot water for her to make her own.All in all, it was a pleasant stay and a reasonable price. If you go and it is a weekend,I hope Juliette is there. Be sure to say hello.Enjoy!

<Content>Loved it! My husband and I stayed here for six nights in October 2008 and absolutely loved this hotel. We had one of the rooms in what I am told is the newest part of the hotel (or newly renovated). The bed was larger than any we've ever had in a European hotel, as was the bath, and the room was very charming, opening up onto the courtyard. We never heard a speck of noise. The staff are all extremely nice and helpful. I would say that my only regret about this hotel was not having discovered it sooner on one of my earlier trips to my favorite city.

<Content>Friendly, Lovely and Affordable I've stayed at Hotel des Grandes Ecoles about 5 times and each time has been a gem. The rooms are pleasant and the staff very helpful. The garden is welcoming and the breakfast room very sweet.This is a family - run business and not backed by any sort of corporate entity, so there are some rough spots, none of which would ever keep me from returning. Some folks have had trouble with reservations, but I never have. When I am certain i am coming and have specific dates, I follow their website suggestions to the tee. I send an email as early on the 15th of the month 4 months ahead requesting my dates. They send an email back confirming availability and requesting a credit card. They don't actually use the credit card unless you're a no-show. I've also sent an email when my dates are more flexible and I've missed the deadline -- do you have 4 consecutive nights in June? And I've had some success with that.The reservation complaints have subsided, I think, and they may have been caused by the transition from their old pencil and paper system (that defied all understanding) to a computer-based system.Can't recommend this place highly enough. Just warm and fun and well located. But it doesn't have the amenities of a chain hotel (which is what I like about it ... I bring my own soap and shampoo).p.s. While a lot of guide books suggest eating breakfast at a cafe to save $$, we love the 9 E breakfast.

<Content>Cute, Romantic Hotel in the Latin Quarter We had a very pleasant stay at this romantic hotel tucked away in the Latin Quarter; here are some highlights. Cute courtyard/garden, helpful staff, typical French/Parisian decor, great location: 3 minute walk to Metro, 2 min. to plaza with shopping, restaurants, etc., 3 min. to Internet cafe, within walking distance to Pantheon, Sorbonne, Cluny, and the Seine. Insider tip: room 114 has a large balcony and is bigger than other rooms (but it doesn't overlook the courtyard).

<Content>A very nice stay We were at Hotel Des Grandes 脡coles for 4 nights and we really enjoy this place. The location is very convenient in Latin Quarter. The hotel is not directly on the street so it is very quiet. There is a very nice court to relax, have an apero or breakfast. We were in room 135. It was big enough, quiet and spotless clean. All the people working at the hotel were nice and smilling. Really, there is nothing to complaint about this accomodation.

<Content>Great stay helped by wonderful staff A short, three night stay at this hotel was made fantastic by the exceptionally friendly and wonderful staff, they were an absolute joy. The room was comfortable, a decent size and very clean. A beautiful secluded courtyard where breakfast can be served makes this a real gem, excellent value for money. Highly recommended.

<Content>A good choice for staying in the Latin Quarter without spending a lot of money I was very pleased with the hotel. The rooms were nice, although small (which is usually the case in Paris). It's a good location. There's a nice garden. The staff is very helpful -- I lost a button on my suit jacket, and asked one of the staff members if there was a place nearby where I could get it sewn on. She said that one of the maids could do it, and she did -- saving me time and effort. Two small caveats. Their air conditioning seems to be minimal, which could be an issue in hot weather. While it's close to a metro line, it's not one of the better metro lines. You need to make at least one connection to get to the main tourist attractions. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>A Wee Gem highly recommended-great hotel in great location- book it now!!!i stayed in this hotel based on recommendations from TripAdviser posts.. a great little hotel hidden away from the hustle and bustle of Paris.. it's not too glam or salubrious but if you just want somewhere to retire to after a days sight seeing this is the place to go. it's clean and great value for money.we had very little interaction with the staff so i can't comment on them but htey seemed friendly enough (during our weekend in paris i never encountered any of the infamous rudeness- i must say i was a little disappointed)we didn't eat there, there's a square around the corner from the hotel and we had our breakfasts there instead, a bit pricey but you go to paris for value and what better way to enjoy a morning coffee than sitting on the terrace watching paris waking up for another day of chicness???The only things that may put a body off staying are that the rooms are basic and small, the floral print wallpaper is not to be looked at when hungover (and they have covered every surface in the room with it) there's no TV or any of that modern nonsense but when you've the city of lights as a backdrop who needs the telly??? None of these bothered us in fact they added to the charm of the place and i'd deffinelty try and book it again the next time i'm in paris but judging by its popularity on TAdvisor i'll probably have to book a year in advance.... i found some grat bars and restaurants in the area too if you want to message me about them

<Content>Quiet, clean, romantic hotel We just returned from Paris and stayed 11 nights in this hotel. It was a fantastic experience. The staff were friendly, especially if you made an effort to speak French. The room was very clean. The hotel is extremely quiet - we faced the garden and it was lovely to wake up to the sound of only the birds and not traffic. The hotel is close to lots of restaurants, bakeries, a grocery store, cafes and two metro stations. It was a 10-15 minute walk to the Seine and Notre Dame. The breakfast is good but you can save a bit by just taking coffee (6 euros for two coffees) and going to the local bakery for your pastry - we found the 9 euro each for breakfast a bit steep however they were the BEST croissant we had in Paris!! We would highly recommend this hotel if you can get a reservation.

<Content>Lovely small hotel We accidentally arrived 2 days early in Paris and could not get into our rental apt for another day. We called the Hotel des Grandes Ecoles and were told there was a room available. It was lovely as were the grounds. It was such an oasis in the midst of Paris. We highly recommend it. Since the hotel does not have air conditioning, it would have been better for us in a 2nd-floor room to sleep with open windows, but that is a minor problem.

<Content>+Lived up to all expectations My cousin and I were in Paris for 4 days, 3 nights early March. We found tthe Grandes Ecoles on TravelAdvisor and were torn between it and another hotel. No regrets whatsoever on choosing the Ecoles. Charming, charming area - close to all sorts of eating establishments and close enough to walk to Notre Dame and Louvre (I am 76 year old sr. citizen and my cousin is just pre-sr. citizen age). Rooms were lovely - clean and spacious. EVERTHING worked the way it was supposed to. Felt perfectly safe in hotel and around area.Would recommend highly!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>warm and wonderful My 17 year old daughter just returned from 5 days in Paris, and highly recommend Hotel des Grand Ecoles. We choose the hotel by reading reviews in TripAdvisor and agree that Grand Ecoles has a great combination of location, price, charm, and lovely helpful staff. It was perfect for a mother-daughter trip.

<Content>I loved this hotel! This was my first time in Paris and this hotel made my trip so comfortable and easy. Metro station 3-4 minute walk, the beautiful Seine and Ile-St-Louis is a mere 10-minute walk away. Great bakeries on the corner but . . . the hotel is what really shines. You walk into a lovely cobllestoned courtyard garden. I had my two teenaged sons with me and we stayed in a room with three twin beds on the 2nd floor. Our windows looked out into the courtyard. Bathrooms were great with good water pressure and hot water. I cannot recommend this place enough!

<Content>Perfect, perfect, perfect I searched and searched for the perfect Hotel in Paris. I went back and forth between location and hotel stars, and trip advisor reviews. It took me two months to make the decsion. Finally I went back to my very first choice which was this hotel. It was exactly as it was described. A perfect garden, signing birds, and clean lovely rooms. It was two blocks from many cafes, quiet cobblestone streets and the Pantheon. The metro was 4 minutes walk down the hill. The satff was helpful and the place was all around perfect. The bathroom was a normal size as were the rooms. I was expecting Teeny-tiny rooms and it was just a normal size. We were there for 3 nights before traveling to Bordeaux. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants a quiet peacful hotel that is a clean, three star, close to the metro, walking distance to cafes, and reasonable priced.

<Content>Useless Planning our trip to Paris in summer 2008 and heard about the HOTEL DES GRANDES ECOLES through the tripadvisor community. Tried to book as early as 6 months in advance but were told by the hotel that they only accept reservations from a certain deadline onwards...Deadline came, we resent our reservation, only to be told that they are fully booked for the period we wanted to stay there...Might be a charming little gem in the heart of Paris, we will never find out, but their reservation service certainly sucks! (By the way, it seems to be impossible to book this hotel through any of the usual internet booking agencies...)

<Content>oh dear no reservation like the previous correspondent, I had sent an e-mail requesting rooms in early May. I had no reply, so telephoned the hotel direct. A charming lady told me they were full for those dates. I went right through May with her and what luck 3 nights were available later in the month. I asked if they would like a credit card for booking fee and was told to write in - which I did. Also e-mailed, twice, advising we had been given these dates. and what booking fee did they require. One week later received an e-mail stating they were full for the nights I had booked over the phone. Also another e-mail to say that they had a room for 4 nights for my original booking in early May.! Oh dear, like the previous review went ahead and booked other things, which I cannot really change. Maybe next year.

<Content>They screwed up our reservation We have not stayed yet at the Grandes Ecoles, but we had been hoping to, on strong recommendation. They confirmed by email, but 24 hours later announced they had made an erreur de planning (de mois). Very irritating given that I had made non-modifiable travel plans in the time between acceptance and cancellation. Are they to be trusted? Should I persevere with them?

<Content>Wonderful refuge This hotel is a wonderful refuge from the big city. The garden is a fabulous place to eat breakfast every morning. The rooms are on the small side but quiet. The bathroom was a little funky - the tub was very high to get in and out of - but adequate. Great location as well, very close to Rue Mouffetard. I thought the staff wwere helpful as well. The only downside for me was that there were so many other Americans!

<Content>Cheerful chintz and chocolates No longer such a well-kept secret, but still a little gem in the 5th arrondissement. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find any French accents in the building, since when we were there (over Christmas 2007) it seemed to be full of Tripadvisor readers from the US, UK or Australia! Cheerfully chintzy, clean and good value accommodation, amazingly friendly service levels for Paris and enormously accessible (20 mins from Eurostar by metro): oh, and free chocolates on Christmas Day morning! We were travelling with 11-year old son - room for three had a curtained off area for the extra bed. If you get TV withdrawal, the hotel now offers very cheap wifi. Five minutes walk from the Paris botanic gardens, if you like that kind of thing.

<Content>Idyllic setting! Truely, a hidden gem. My wife and I celebrated our 35th wedding anniversary at this little treasure! Just a couple of blocks from the subway. The wooden gate at the street opens to a cobblestone walkway that leads you to the wonderful courtyard and beautiful gardens. The staff is excellent and helpful. the first three nights we were fortunate to get room 29, ground floor, large room with extra large bath and king size bed. There are no televisions but this is Paris!! There is so much to see and do that unless you are on a very extended stay you will not miss television. Wonderful shops and restaurants are close by and most have english menus if needed. The last two nights we had room 114, a lovely room, a little smaller but through the french doors you were led to a large private balcony that was delightful!! I would recommend this hotel highly. Very much a Parisian feeling.

<Content>It is so easy to like Grandes Ecoles! Boked this hotel after many good reviews here at TripAdvisor and we were not disapointed!The Latin Quarter is nice and calm to live in and the vital areas in Paris are within walking or metro distance.We arrived at CDG and took the RER to Luxembourg (30-35 min) and then walked 10 min directly to the hotel (no need to transfer with metro). But beware of the gatsten when your travel with a larger bag! :)Nice neigborhood with beauitiful churces, building and parks. Though, many tourist traps (restaurants) along Rue Moufferdad. Move south in the Montparnasse-direction and the area will be less tourist and more value and quality for money.We stayed in room number 1 just across the reception area. We were affraid that the noise should be a problem, but the room had to doors so it wasn't any problems with the noice. We pais 鈧?10 per night and 鈧?6 for breakfast. Good value for the room, but breakfast was rather expensive according to what you got (a small pice of baguette, a croassint, orange juice and coffe), but the staff are nice and the small caf茅-tables are pitoresque. Rooms are on the smaller side, but you will forget it in this very Laura Ashley-orgy of flowers!Paris can be very noisy, but due the the inner yard, the Grandes Escoles are like a quite oasis. I can imange that this hotel in the summertime can be completly lovely!Will defenitly stay here again!

<Content>Exceptional comfort and value This was my second time at Grandes Ecoles and was as pleased this time as last. The price and location are unbeatable. The rooms are pristine, a bit cutesy but give you the feeling of being in Paris, not a North American Hotel. The beds would be smallish for a 6ft North American man I think, but the women i have travelled with were very happy. I was surprised to find that it now has Wifi but happily no TV or radio. We walked everywhere, but when the metro is required I recommend walking accross the Isle St Louis and taking the Metro from the Right Bank. I wonder if grandmere is getting a bit deaf because you always get full breakfast even if only cafe is desired. But she is so sweet and accomodating it is a small thing and can be overlooked easily.

<Content>Birdsong in the middle of Paris?! We were amazed to wake on our first morning at the Hotel des Grandes Ecoles to hear birds singing in the courtyard. This was the kind of surprise we found throughout our stay. From the wonderful shower in our bathroom to the multi-lingual staff, everything was just a little bit better than we expected--even though the hotel had come highly recommended by relatives.Just up the street from the hotel is the Place de la Contrescarpe--restaurants and bars are easily in walking distance, without feeling like you're trapped by tourists at every turn. And down the street there are grocery stores and patisseries (and the Metro!). The wallpaper in our room was a little busy, but our room came with a fan, a great big window into the courtyard, and a comfy bed--who cares about the wallpaper?!

<Content>The old school We were recommended to this hotel from some other people who had stayed there. We were very happy with the recommendation. This is an intimate 2 star hotel that used to be some sort of a school back in the day. It's located in the Latin Quarter and we had easy access to the METRO at the Cardinal Rue LeMoine. It was also very easy to walk pretty much anywhere. We had 1 room for 2 adults and 2 kids which was fine because we spent most of our time sightseeing. A really nice feature is that at night they have a very large steel door that they close keeping the small but delightful garden and courtyard secluded. Book this hotel with plenty of confidence. The petit dejeuner was quaint, served by the elderly woman owner who is quite charming.

<Content>Unclean, Unhelpful, Unfriendly This was once a great budget find. This time, the room smelled of body odor. They were full so there was no other room. Something bit me (mosquitoes, lice, bedbugs ?) the second night. I told them I could not sleep another night in that room. They charged me for the third night anyway. Such a shame the management is so bad.

<Content>What a Paris Hotel should be! My sister-in-law and I stayed at this hotel last year - we left our husbands and kids at home and decided to see Paris from a ladies' point-of view. We originally planned a stay of 12 nights but decided to shorten our Paris adventure and head to the Provence area for a few days. I gave the hotel two-week notice of our change of plans and received an immediate confirmation and OK from the front desk. We took a shuttle from the airport which was a great move - great value plus we had the benefit of the friendly, experienced driver acting as a tour-guide, pointing out all the great spots of interest around Paris. The Hotel courtyard that greeted us was spectacular! Check out all the posted pictures - the courtyard is private, beautifully landscaped and oh, so French. The check-in was smooth, we had a comfortable, nicely decorated room on the second floor with a great view of the courtyard. Now, we did not go to Paris to watch TV or hang out in our room so we immediately set out to scope out the neighbourhood. To our great surprise, we discovered Rue Moufftard and it's market and shops with Cafe Marc serving one of the best and least expensive coffies in Paris. We found a seat every time we visited (there is no take-out coffee here - sit and enjoy). While strolling, we ate a croissant or a goodie from one of the numerous neighbourhood bakeries so breakfast was always exciting and new. I thought the breakfast at the hotel was pricey so we just found other alterernatives. For lunch, we again picked up something from the market and ate back at the hotel in the lovely courtyard, surrounded by the lovely scents, bird songs as well the the sound of the childrens' choir coming from the nearby school. It was fabulous! The location of this hotel is ideal - we walked everywhere (resulting in a 10lbs loss in weight for each of us during our 2 week stay in France): The church of Notre Dame, the Pantheon, Luxenburg gardens, thousands of shops and restaurants of the Latin quater...Upon returning to Paris after our trip south, we had to stay in another nearby hotel - it was more expensive but what a dump by comparison! Please don't complain about room sizes or hospitality in Hotel des Grandes Ecoles until you've seen other Parisian options, and we did see at least a dozen - yuck! We so wished that our Gem of a hotel was again available but they do book up early. After all, it keeps appearing as one of the best values in Paris in many of the Travel books. We both agreed! I can't wait to go back.

<Content>Oasis in the centre of Paris This hotel was recommended to us by friends and it didn't disappoint. It is in a perfect location - walking distance to all the main sites and surrounded by markets and restaurants, yet when you go through the large gates into a beautiful garden courtyard, the hustle and bustle of Paris is left behind. The rooms are bigger than average and are very French (ie. floral). Book well ahead and try to get a room away from the lifts.

<Content>Hidden treasure I know this review is long coming considering the time elapsed, but better late than never. At the time of travelling to France to spend 5 weeks experiencing all regions, ( I'm in the wine industry) a French work colleague warned me to stay in one hotel only, so who should question a frenchman? He did not disappoint. Like all reviews before close to everything, but it has the real french feel that you are looking for. So relax and let the atmosphere wash over you.Salut

<Content>charming - good value - excellent location My husband and I stayed at Hotel Des Grandes Ecoles for 2 nights 5/19 -5/21/07 on our way back from Venice, Italy. I chose this hotel based on the reviews on this website, I was not disappointed. Our room, although small, was charming, it has a nice soaking tub, though it was slippery if taking a shower and we thought they should provide a bath mat or rail on the wall. The room does not have a tv or radio (probably due to the proximity of rooms next door) and I noticed they also do not have a/c. This was not an issue, but I don't know if it would be in the summer. We opted for breakfast at an additional 8 euros each, this included juice (which you must ask for in French), coffee, baguette and croissant. I'm not sure if I would do this again or just walk to a local boulangerie as they are everywhere. The site of the hotel is tucked away behind large wooden doors and when opened reveals a very nice romantic spot. Unfortunately it rained a bit while we were there - but on the first night a group of Brits were happily enjoying wine in the garden. The location in the Latin Quarter is excellent, close to the Metro, and we walked and took the Metro all over Paris. I highly recommend this hotel. Also, when booking - one must wait 4 months prior to the stay to book, any earlier and reservations are not accepted.

<Content>Word of mouth wasn't wrong Over many years friends have visited this hotel and this time it was our turn and it was great. Quiet inside the hotel and delightful courtyard surroundings but plenty of Parisien life outside the gates and cafes where you can sit and watch the world go by. The welcome was friendly and helpful , the rooms a decent size, the beds comfortable and good bathrooms. Perhaps I shouldn't say this because next time we go it will be booked out! We will continue to recommend to others.

<Content>Good choice in Paris We stayed at L'Hotel des Grandes Ecoles for 5 nights last spring. My husband and I had a double bed while the kids shared a pull-out couch that seemed quite comfortable. The room was a good size for 4 people from what we expected in Paris. We had a desk built into the wall and a small table with 2 chairs where we had our breakfast. The bathroom was clean and modern complete with a hairdryer. No issues with bed bugs as I had read.Our room was near the entrance (on the first floor) yet it seemed quiet. If you go left out of the hotel, there is a cafe diagonally across from the hotel where you can get cafe au lait to go (granted it is in a plastic Heineken cup that will burn your hands if you don't walk fast). First I would get croissants at a local patisserie and then the coffee.It's a nice area to stroll around and yet close enough to the sites that you can go back for an afternoon siesta if you choose. Nice place - would stay there again.

<Content>Beautiful bargain, but beware of bedbugs We stayed for a week in a room on the top floor in June '03, so perhaps (hopefully) the problem has long been fixed. The hotel is a delightful and serene well-priced haven, as others have noted. But in the middle of the night near the end of our stay, I was up and noticed a lot of small dots moving in the bathroom. Lights on!! Ditto for the bed. Black spots on the sheets, too. The next morning itchy bumps were rising on my arms and hands. Apparently, it's typical for it to take a number of days of bites for the body to develop an allergic reaction. We told the staff, who did not seem surprised about the bugs, and they sprayed the room. Unfortunately, this had no effect and the previous night's adventure was repeated. We checked out, with our lower arms covered in bites. The hotel's owners were not very interested in the problem, and offered no compensation. When we returned home, it ook over a week for the itching and bumps to subside. Needless to say, we left all our luggage outside and fumigated it before bringing it into the house. Another problem with our top-floor room was the heat. There was no AC, and in the first week of June 03, this already made it quite difficult to sleep, and impossible to cool off when returning to the room at the end of the day to get ready for dinner. (later that summer, there were a record number of deaths from a heat wave in Europe) Today's article in the NY Times travel section says that AC is only needed about 4 weeks in the summer in Paris - I think it's more like 4 months. We were in Paris in late June 05 with no AC, and were sweltering. Also, in late July in the Swiss mountains last year, it was over 90F for several days. I think foregoing AC in the summer in Europe will no longer do, with hotter summers becoming pretty typical there.

<Content>Clean, reasonably priced, snobby If you're looking for a clean, well located, no frills hotel in Paris, this might be a good choice. It's in the lively Latin Quarter,close to lots of great restaurants, and just a block from the Metro.The price is right. However, it's loud in the morning, the breakfast is unimpressive, and they do not seem to have gotten over the stereotypic French snobbery. We had a problem with our bathroom and were yelled at and humiliated for this. Not our idea of customer service. They also interupted our afternoon nap to clean our room, rather than cleaning it in the late morning. We felt more like unwelcome house guests, than pampered customers. They did not even say Merci when we checked out.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel des Grandes Ecoles experience We have just returned from 7 nights at the Hotel de Grandes Ecoles and have fallen in love with both the hotel and with Paris. Our room on the third floor overlooked the courtyard, with wide windows that opened out letting in birdsong, the sound of nearby church bells, and a wonderful, elusive fragrance that we couldn't identify. We could only bring ourselves to close the windows when the wind drove the rain into our room, which was very comfortable and charmingly decorated. The bathroom was attractive as well, with a fine in-tub shower, scented soaps and shampoos, a hair dryer and plenty of towels. True there is no television, radio, or mini-bar; but those are items we do our best to avoid on vacations, so that absence goes in the plus column for us. The breakfast is essentially what we would term a continental one and not worth the 8euro each; although, again, it is charmingly presented. We preferred to buy delicious pain au chocolat from a marvelous little boulangerie in Place Contrascarpe, a two minute walk away, and bring them back to a table in the lovely courtyard. It was a challenge that we could not meet to locate any place that could provide take away tea, but we discovered that we could purchase it from the hotel for 3euro. worth it for a habitual tea drinker! The staff were pleasant and helpful, the price a reasonable 115 euro for two. This hotel will definitely be our Paris location on future visits.

<Content>Tiny, Not Expected The hotel was in an excellent area, very close to everything. The rooms were clean and the courtyard was quite enchanting. However, it was simply a very nice place to sleep and nothing else. The breakfast is overpriced, and the rooms are tiny, especially the triples. The room contains neither radio alarm clock nor television, so if you need these forget about it. If you want a nice clean place in a good neighborhood and do not care about luxuries, amenities, etc then it is ok. I wouldn't not stay there again, but I wouldn['t go out of my way to stay there again either.

<Content>True Parisian Experience The location in the fantastic City of Lights was perfect for my husband and me. We literally walked to all parts of Paris, and when out of energy, headed for the nearby metro. Nothing was difficult to manage. The ambience of the hotel and the neighborhood made us feel like we were living in Paris, not just visiting. The very French decor, the personalities of the innkeepers, and the delicious breakfasts were excellent amenities. The room was charmingly decorated, very clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The only downside to the hotel is that the bedroom floor-space was limited, which made for difficult luggage management, and the bathroom was also small. But we figured it all out and coped just fine. I would highly recommend this hotel for discriminating people who want an authentic old Paris experience rather than the large hotel experience.

<Content>Just OK and don't stay there in the summer We stayed at the hotel this past summer. It's pleasant and the price is good. The courtyard can get a little noisy at night. The bonus was that our room had a queen bed and 2 single beds which is nice for a family. The downside is tht it was EXTREMELY hot and if you left the window open it got dirty quickly. The breakfast was very average and croissants tasted stale! Most mornings we'd walk over to one of the cafes nearby and eat there. The location is good but I would look at other places at the same price point before booking this one again

<Content>Great hotel, great location I find it hard to believe the last reviewer and I stayed at the same hotel. My wife and I just returned from four days and I have to say it was as terrific as so many dozens of American travellers and travel writers have said. Yes, the rooms are smaller and the walls are not sound-proof. That's true of all older hotels in France. And in this hotel, there are big differences room-to-room. We were first offered a room on the ground floor, but it had only a double bed - too small for us. When I asked for a different room with a bigger bed we were offered something on the second floor that was bigger, had a queen size bed and a full size tub/shower in the bathroom. Big difference -- same price. We stayed in room 134. It was at the end of the upstairs hallway and had a big window that opened over the beautiful central courtyard. When you reserve, ask for an upstairs room.The breakfast was surperb. We didn't take it the first day because the area is loaded with fabulous bakeries. So on the first morning I ventured out in search of rolls, fruit and coffee to bring back to the room. Alas, it is very easy to buy any kind of warm fresh baked good you can imagine in this neighborhood. But they don't sell coffee at the bakeries. One needs to go to a cafe -- take out coffee in paper cups is unheard of in Paris. So the next two mornings we took the petit dejuner at the hotel. The coffee is about the best I've ever tasted --rich and dark --and the croissants were freshly baked.The location is an oasis in a very lively neighborhood at the Rue Mouffetard, packed with cafes, bars, stores and hundreds of pedestrians -- mostly a student crowd. There is a jazz bar around the corner that made noise until about 2 AM on Friday night but was quiet on Saturday night.A few other tips - The Rue Cardinal Metro station is closed for at least the next few months for repairs, which meant we had to use the Jussieu stop and go up the hill on Rue des Boulangers.Taxis - Unlike NYC and other big cities, one cannot flag down a cab on the street in Paris. You need to have the hotel call for a cab or go to a taxi stand. The nearest one to the hotel is at the junction of Blvd St Germain and Rue Monge - a decent walk. We also got to and from the CDG airport on the RER line B using the Luxembourg station on Blvd St-Michel. You get a great view of the Pantheon on this walk and the neighborhood seems very safe. This was a big savings over a $60 cab ride.

<Content>Can't figure out why this rates 3 stars - I'd give it 2 at best! I was really disappointed in this hotel, especially after reading the reviews. Granted, it has a lovely courtyard with flowers, trees and seating, but there are signs everywhere asking you to keep it quiet as there are rooms off this courtyard. Besides, I'm not in Paris to sit in the hotel courtyard, no matter how pretty. The walls of the rooms are paper-thin: I heard the elevator (next to my room) all night long, and when the couple next door came in late, I awoke with a jerk positive that someone was in my room (they were not being noisy). The bathroom had one of those narrow folding-door showers where if you drop the soap, there is no way to pick it up with out shutting off the shower and getting out. No tub either. The best linens ever experienced in a French hotel (better than some 4 stars) and the pretty room did not compensate for the thin walls, lack of television, and poor shower/bath. Two other major problems for me: neighborhood and the petit dejeuner. At the petit dejeuner, which was an extra charge, store-bought hermetically sealed in plastic danish are served, which is a sacrilege in Paris! The neighborhood is deserted most of the time - being behind the Pantheon and next to the Paris Department of Buildings. There is no where for blocks and blocks to buy a bottle of water and the local ethnic restaurants are mediocre at best, mostly serving as late-night hangouts for students to smoke and drink.

<Content>A hidden jem in Paris! Hotel des Grandes Ecoles is an amazing value in Paris!This inn is a little secret hidden in the Latin Quarter of Paris. It was a perfect place to stay for our first visit to Paris. The location is within walking distance to three metro stops as well as Notre Dame cathedral. There are many good restaurants, patisseries and cafes nearby. The neighborhood also has a good vibe with many students attending the local universities.We didn't have breakfast at the inn as there are many places in the neighborhood to stop off and get a wonderful pastry and coffee.I highly recommend staying at Hotel Grandes Ecoles, and my wife and I will definitely return in the years to come.Please e-mail michael_r_higgins@hotmail.com if you would like photos of our room, which overlooked the garden courtyard or other tips about the neighborhood.

<Content>Great Hotel After staying at least 10 times at the Minerve Hotel we were fortunate to find a room at the last minute when we chose to check out of the Minerve due to insecticide problems. What a surprise! The rooms are much larger than the Minerve including the bathroom that had a shower and tub!! When we looked out the little window of the bathroom, we could see the Pantheon!!!! The staff were extremely friendly - service excellence! When our shuttle was just a few minutes late, the man at the front desk was outside with us on his cell phone checking into it! The price was the same as the Minerve...same location - no insecticide ....balcony facing the same street as the Minerve...elevator to our room was twice the size! We will stay here when we return next year. Keep in mind, if you are travelling in the summer and require air condition, the hotel does not provide it...but any other time...this would be a great choice!

<Content>Quiet, clean, convenient, and friendly We booked three nights at this hotel through the web, and had no problems with the reservation at all. The location is very convenient to the Metro (1 block up from the Cardinal Lemoine station), easily reached from the train station (we came on the high-speed Thalys train from Belgium) and yet the hotel is amazingly quiet. It's set back from the Rue Cardinal Lemoine by a tall gated wall, and has a lovely courtyard garden. Your room key opens the outside gate for coming back to your room after 10:00 pm.We had a quad room, with our two teenage children staying with us. The price for this 4-person room was very fair at 150 Euro per night, which was slightly lower than quotes at other lower-rated hotels in the Latin Quarter. Our room was on the third floor, in a corner of the building facing away from the street, and had large windows opening onto both the garden and the entrance walkway, plus a private bathroom with shower. The two beds consisted of a queen size bed and a pull-out double bed from a couch, but they were suitably comfortable. The room also included a small table and chairs, plus adequate closet space. It was very clean and well maintained, and the bathroom was spotless with plenty of linens and soaps. Although it was not air conditioned, there were two fans in the room, which we didn't need due to an unusually cool week in August (low 60s at night).The staff were very friendly and helpful, and were quite patient with my destruction of the French language. We did not take the hotel breakfast, but instead opted for croissants from patisseries along the way at much lower cost. We were also able to store our bags in the lobby/office after checkout for several hours until our train departure.The location is simply wonderful, less than a 10-minute walk to Notre Dame, two blocks from many restaurants and shops on the Rue Mouffetard, and two blocks from the Pantheon. There are plenty of small cafes and brasseries nearby, along with a small supermarket, ATM, and creperies for snacks or lunch. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is seeking a clean, comfortable, and quiet place to stay in the left bank. We will absolutely stay here again on our next trip to Paris.

<Content>Reservation confusion I waited for the required time per the hotel's booking procedure to make a reservation. I have read so many good things about this hotel and its rate and location are excellent. Everything went well with the resesrvation process. However, I needed to revise my dates and emailed the hotel by forwarding my confirmation email they sent to me explaining that I needed to revise my stay from three days to two. I received no reply for two days. I resent the email and finally they same person who confirmed my reservation, Fabienne, responded. Instead of revising the dates as I requested plainly I received a new reservation offer for the three original days.Again I sent another email explaining the same request about revising the dates only and that I do not need a new reservation as I already had one and to check the reservation records for my name. I received a reply saying they could not open the attachment I sent, but I didn't send any attachment. I explained once more my request but again I received another reservation offer but this time for two days!By this time I became frustrated with the whole ordeal. I could not understand why my simple request was not understood properly. I thought perhaps there is a language barrier, but then I understand from previous guests' comments that the front desk lady is fluent in English.I ended up canceling the reservation in full as I didn't want to be charged an extra night in error. Unbelievably the same lady, Fabienne, emailed me a cancellation confirmation immediately. It's amazing how she understood that email very well, but couldn't understand the previous ones.Sorry, but I prefer to stay at a hotel that has staff who responds properly to a guest's request.

<Content>Comfortable hotel, excellent location We stayed for six nights in February 2006. We flew into CDG and the hotel was easy to find using the metro. The staff were very friendly and eager to help (even when I asked to borrow a needle and thread - using dreadful French). We did not have breakfast. The hotel is central and quiet but the surrounding neighbourhood is lively at night. There were several good restaurants within 5 - 10 minutes walk and we always felt safe walking at night. Our room was an average size - ground floor - perfect for our needs. This was our first visit to Paris and I felt we made a very good choice. I would return.

<Content>Our Second Stay to Celebrate Our 20th Wedding Anniversary in Paris. Our first stay was in 2003 when I booked this hotel from their website on the internet based on the website. We couldn't have been more pleased. From the location near the Pantheon and the Sorbonne on the Left Bank to the private entrance through a gate on the street and up a cobblestone walkway to the separate buildings surrounding the cobblestone courtyard, it was ideal. The distance from the street provides a quiet, restful stay. The hotel is run by Madame, the proprietor and under the direction of Marie Le Floch who provide warm and personal service. The staff are all courteous and friendly. We espcially liked the decor of the rooms which is very homey and gives an ambiance of a quaint hotel rather than a large, chain facility. The breakfast room off the office in the main building is similar and very comfortable. The continental breakfast includes the wonderful baked goods of Paris. The rooms are without TV also which adds to the restful, quiet atmosphere like the location away from the street provides a quiet outdoor atmosphere. The courtyard provides a gathering place for guests for breakfast if perferred to the indoor breakfast room or room service in your room. It also is a gathering place espcially in the evening for people to enjoy food and drink they purchase elsewhere or from the hotel. The location is near a Metro station and just uphill on the Rue Cardinal Lemoine is the Place Contrescarpe with cafes and eateries. Down the opposite side of the hill from the hotel is well-known Rue Mouffetard which is lined on both sides with eateries, cafes, shops, an ATM and a market at the bottom of the Rue. And so my wife and I booked as early as possible on the hotel website and enjoyed our second stay as much or more than the last. We will always plan to stay there when we are visiting Paris. We were able this time to stay for ten days and we are already missing Paris and the hotel. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions about our stay.

<Content>Seven times at Grandes Ecoles and wanting to go back again. We've stayed at Hotel des Grandes Ecoles seven times since 1998 and have come to love it more with every stay. The rooms are comfortable, the staff is welcoming (in that slightly aloof but still appealing Parisian sort of way) and the location is great -- close enough to everything to make touring easy, but just far enough away from the tourist center to have the feel of a real neighborhood. But the garden is the main glory of Grandes Ecoles. After an exciting, but tiring, day in busy Paris, going into the GE garden is like taking a trip into the country. We usually make our visits in October just as the leaves are turning gold. What a pleasure opening our shutters in the morning and looking out into the autumn glory! On our last visit we took three other couples with us and all are still thanking us for sharing our secret Paris hotel with them. Now, I suppose, we'll have to start booking even further ahead, since the secret is deservedly out.

<Content>Could be perfect ... I stayed 2 nights in this hotel. Situated in a quiet and traditional neighbourhood. The room was big enough and modestly furnished. Great bathroom. No TV, no minibar, no ice machine, traditional (poor) french breakfast, no newspapers. But friendly and stylish (with flower wallpapers). With a little more comfort and service, this hotel could be perfect!

<Content>Tr猫s agr茅able! We (couple, English, late 40's) and daughter (16) have just returned from 3 nights at the hotel, and wanted to address some of the issues raised in the few negative reports we've read. Shower gel/shampoo, soap and a hair dryer were provided. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure in the shower. My husband and I are both 6'2 (1.88) and our daughter is 5'10 (1.78); our rooms (on the top floor) were perfectly adequate in size, although if we'd been staying longer, we might have wanted a bit more sitting space. The garden is lovely, but the weather wasn't conducive to sitting out. However, with several caf茅s a stone's throw away, we weren't bothered overmuch. The lift is somewhat snug, but we didn't find the stairs too taxing. Breakfast, we thought, was fine - a hot drink, fruit juice, a large croissant, what seemed like half a baguette and a pot of jam each - but there are plenty of caf茅s in the neighbourhood serving breakfast (though not much cheaper than at the hotel) and plenty of boulangeries, a market in Rue Mouffetard and a little supermarket in the square up the road for a DIY breakfast. The lack of a TV is a positive advantage; no noise from neighbouring rooms! And most kiosks sell English language newspapers.In summary, a pleasant, clean and comfortable hotel in an excellent location, with very agreeable staff. We'd certainly stay there again.Oh - and we simply picked up a taxi at CDG airport; the taxi queue was easy to find, and was marshalled. We were quoted 鈧?5 for the ride into town but were, in fact, only charged 鈧?9. On the return journey, the hotel booked us a shuttle for 鈧?5.

<Content>The perfect hotel This is our second year staying at this hotel. We love it. The garden and patio area are so beautiful. The rooms are lovely. The staff is very friendly. The metro station is a short walk. There's a beautiful square two minutes from the hotel with cafes and restaurants. This hotel is what I thought a Paris hotel should be - quaint and charming.

<Content>Great value Rooms larger than average for Paris, quite clean despite some seriously chipped paint on the bathroom ceiling. Location is excellent, price is very reasonnable. Entrance inside a garden is a bit unpratical for loading /unloading luggage, but it is charming. No TV is no problem: hey, you're in Paris!

<Content>Marvelous place ! We are a family of six people from Finland and spent the Easter of 2006 in Paris.We always check the tripadvisor hotel reviews before we decide the hotel where we want to stay in, The hotel Grandes des Ecoles had great recommendations. We did not get disappointed. The location was great in Latin Quater, just 5 min walk from the metro station Cardinal Lemoine, 15 min walk to Notre Dame, close Panthenon and Sorbonne.The Latin Quarter is full of nice restaurants, cafes and bakerys.We will absolutely choose this hotel again when we will return to Paris, hopefully soon.

<Content>We'll be back! Just returned from 4 nights at Hotel des Grandes Ecoles with my wife and 2 daughters and we loved it! Our room was smaller than some of the other quads, but still more than adequate. We passed on breakfast (preferring to make a daily run on a nearby boulangerie), but I had them send a carafe of coffee to our room each morning, which was very good and reasonably priced (as compared to the (very hot) dixie cup I received when I requested a grand cafe to go in a nearby cafe).While it is slightly off the beaten path, who really wants to try to sleep on the beaten path anyway? Very convenient to the Metro and the wonderful Rue Mouffetard area (we liked it better than Rue Cler) and a 10-minute walk from THE premier kid attraction in Paris (with apologies to Disney)--the Luxemburg Garden and its wonderful playground!For the location and cost, I can't imagine the HGE being beaten.

<Content>great area for food lovers My husband and I stayed last month at Hotel des Grandes Ecoles located in the Latin Quarter just a long block away from the metro stop of Cardinal Lemoine. Room 5 on the ground floor, surprisingly noise-proof as it is just steps away from the reception and breakfast areas. The room was larger than we've stayed at in other Paris hotels. The private bathroom always had hot water and the place was very clean. The continental breakfast (8 euros per person) was enough for us, baguettes and croissants with jams and butter, and they serve an excellent hot chocolate with refills on all the hot beverages. The neighborhood was great for food lovers as we discovered a charcuterie on rue Monge owned by a man whose grandfather established it. We snacked on thin slices of meats, cheese wedges, bread and a small bottle of wine which he even opened for us and supplied cups too. Going in the other direction we discovered rue Mouffetard with many choices of dining alternatives, moderately priced and quite good in quality. A small record store yielded music cd's which we know we wouldn't have found in the US. The staff, the hotel itself and the neighborhood all helped make our stay at this hotel a memorable one. We hope to return one day.

<Content>What a gem! I recently stayed at the Hotel des Grandes Ecoles - March 1-10, 2006. I haven't stayed in too many hotels in Paris, but I can't imagine a better or more charming place to stay. The location is perfect. Walked to Notre Dame, Sainte Chapelle, Concierge and Pantheon. Many charming restaurants in the area. The metro is located one block away. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Marie is the best, giving directions, making reservations etc. The room was delightful;decorated in French country. Room and bathroom were immaculate. I can't recommend this hotel strongly enough.

<Content>Pleasant stay in Paris We stayed at the Hotel des Grandes Ecoles for 10 days in Feb., 2006. The hotel is quite charming, but the rooms are small. We had to upgrade from the room they put us in since the original garret room was too small for us to open both our suitcases! The hotel is very clean, nicely decorated and well-cared for by the family who own and run it. Breakfast is available at 8 euros which we though a bit pricey. We found a cafe nearby on Rue Monge and had our croissants and cafe cremes there each morning. The hotel is well situated for touring Paris and close to Metro stops and many reasonably priced restaurants. There is, however, no internet access and we found it a challenge to find easily acccesible internet cafes. I loved the charming atmosphere, but my husband found it a bit over the top for his taste. I consider this a pretty good value for the going rates in Paris.

<Content>Great Service SL is a very welcoming place. The staff is always willing to go out of their way to make the customer satisfied and happy. The hotel is impeccably clean and maintained. The food is very good (though not gourmet). There is a very nice continental-type breakfast available free each morning. The location is good, being about 1/2 mile from the downtown in a safe section of town. They provide good help with tours, laundry, and transportation. The prices are reasonable.

<Content>Charming garden hotel Hotel des Grandes Ecoles is actually three separate buildings situated around a cobblestone courtyard with carefully tended gardens. You enter the courtyard through huge green doors, which are closed at 8pm and afford more privacy and security. The rooms are decorated in french country style. Our room (#221) had cute blue etoile wallpaper with matching curtains. It was clean and comfortable and the hotel staff was helpful and patient with our terrible french (or lack thereof). Its location is a little out of the way but, consequently, it is very quiet at night. I would highly recommend this little gem for your next stay in Paris.

<Content>French Attitude Hi Just back from a week's stay in Paris. We read about this hotel in our eyewitness guide book and reserved a room. For a three star hotel it had no tv or fridge or even a mirror in the room. We had only a trickle of cold water pressure which made showering very difficult! When I told the receptionist of the problem she reply was 'Huh' as if I had come from the next planet. One the final day of our stay, the water pressure was restored and I can tell you it was a joy to have a shower. When checking out there was no apology from the same receptionist who greeted us with an arrogant attitude. Never again!

<Content>Have stayed here three times! This is a lovely hotel--charming old buildings facing a private garden/courtyard. My husband and I keep returning to this hotel over the years and we've met others who do the same. The rooms are well decorated, clean and quiet. You would never know that this hotel is in the middle of a great city. Breakfasts are great, too. It's a great value and convenient to the Metro, Luxembourg Gardens, Rue Mouffetard, the Place de la Contrascarpe. The staff is courteous and helpful. Hotel Des Grandes Ecoles has made our visits in Paris very, very special.

<Content>u we stayed for 6 nites at this hotel and found this to a charming, cute and tucked away rendevous place in Paris. However, beware the rooms are small and the bathrooms were also small, however you can make doo and if you do not hit a heat wave, you will be quite comfortable.

<Content>A really lovely hideaway, highly recommended This is such a nice hotel I almost don't want to recommend it in case it is full up when I next want to go! But I got the details off Tripadvisor...so I guess I have a bit of a duty to add my comments too! It was really delightful. I would always recommend it. Very quiet, very pretty even in November, both inside and out were restful and charming. The heating was extremely good, we were warm and cosy. Staff were so friendly. This was almost like a b  b in atmosphere, the check in is a room with a big old desk, paperwork kept to a minimum, family photos everywhere. The area is charming and we walked most places, we do like walking however and if you don't like to walk, then the metro station of Cardinal Lemoine is nearby, also the rather more useful Luxembourg RER station is about 15 mins walk. There was nothing I didn't like about this hotel, myself, but there are a few things which may perhaps bother some people so are worth mentioning. First, there is no TV, no minibar, no bedside phone, none of those hotel-like things, didn't see any internet or guest lounge or bar. Just a room, albeit a prettily decorated one with lovely view over the garden which was still colourful in November. The breakfast at 7.50 Euros wasn't as good as I expected although it was okay, whereas the rest of the hotel was so charming I'd kind of expected the breakfast to be sensational instead of just ok. The little soaps were a bit ordinary, and bathroom a bit cramped. However it was very clean the beds were comfortable and seemed new, there was a tub not just a shower, nice towels. Lots to do nearby. We had quite pleasant evening meal at the Restaurant Verlaine in rue Descartes where Verlaine died AND Hemingway lived. Thats just around the corner. There's a veggie - wholefood restaurant very nearby, quite unusual for paris, and many other places to eat and snack and sit around

<Content>A Winning Combination Location and Charm equal a winning combination at Hotel des Grandes Ecoles. First the hotel is situated in a beautiful neighborhood, near La Sorbonne in the Latin Quarter, with everything you could want, cafes, restaurants, organic grocery stores, internet points, and even a laundry mat, which my husband needed. And the second is Charm. The hotel is actually removed from the street. So one has to pass through a heavy external door and walk thirty steps up into a garden via cobblestone walkway to get to the hotel. In the morning the hotel offers a optional breakfast in the garden, and after that the tables are left out all day for guests to gather and relax. If you buy a bottle of wine from one of the local shops the hotel provides glasses and a opener. The perfect way to relax after a long day of seeing the sites. The rooms are not large but tastefully decorated in different toiles prints. We had the balloon print. There is no TV. But who needs one in Paris. We will definitly be back.

<Content>Fun Location We stayed for one night before leaving via Charles deGaulle. The room was smaller and not the category we had reserved, but we were charged less. The property is easy to find and has an attached garage - very handy if you are driving, which I do not recommend. The room was worn but comfortable. Definitely would not stay here if you want an air conditioner, service or access to TV. They do not have these.Price was good 105 Euros/night for a double room.

<Content>loved the garden location..but beware Though a lovely hotel and garden upon checking out we had a problem getting a taxi.. and were told to go down the street and get one ourselves as the taxi company was not answering the phone. We needed to catch a 10am train to Amsterdam. I felt this service was unacceptable. Also they never provided the wake up call..We did make our train via the metro. Just beware if you need to make an important transportation connection.

<Content>Great hotel Great hotel, with very friendly staff, all day singing away as they worked. The room was small but clean. The hotel garden area is great. The hotel is located within a short walk of alot of restaurants. We went to le volcan, which was a great and very affordable restaurant, highly recommend it.

<Content>Charming My extended family and I stayed there October 7-8th, 2004. While one of the owners did not speak much English -- she couldn't have been more pleasant to my family on their first trip to France. She even hugged my niece! Rooms were large for France, we even had a balcony. Very clean and pretty toile wallpaper, etc. The room rate was quite reasonable for a city hotel. I think we paid approximately $150. Would definitely recommend.

<Content>Perfect spot to stay! We found this hotel through Rick Steves guide book and were thrilled with everything about it. The location is hard to beat, with plenty of places to eat or buy food, good shopping and the metro stop that connects with every place you want to go. The hotel staff, without exception, were pleasant and eager to please. I requested a first floor room and that did not pose a problem. The rooms are small but charmingly furnished with large bathrooms, hot water, good beds and plenty of towels. My daughter the travel agent says this more of a a bed and breakfast hotel, as there is no TV, lobby or bar, but that is just what we wanted. And the price is terrific. Five of us celebrated our 60th birthdays there last April and were able to enjoy the newly blooming garden, so I imagine that in the summer, it is beautiful and restful. Highly recommend.

<Content>A perfect retreat in Paris We booked this hotel largely because of the excellent reviews we had read, and we were not disappointed!! It is so pretty and peaceful, in a wonderful location and we were made to feel very welcome by the friendly staff. The breakfasts in the courtyard were the icing on the cake, a wonderful way to start the day! The selection of restaurants and cafes nearby were excellent too. Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone considering a visit to this beautiful city.

<Content>A special place After being warned by friends that a quiet hotel in central Paris would be impossible to find, we discovered this charming place. We shared a quad room with our two teenage daughters and felt the room was bigger than we had anticipated. I thought the matching wallpaper and curtains added so much olde world charm - very Parisian. The room and bathroom were clean and the beds comfortable. Our room looked out over the small garden and rooftops of Paris and was just beautiful. Even with the window open at night there was no noise. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel was excellent and we managed to walk everywhere. It was close to two Metro stations and a ten minute stroll to the Notre Dame and the Seine. Parking is available in an underground carpark on the premises which was a bonus. There is a huge choice of restaurants in the nearby Rue Mouffetard and a Laundrymat and Internet cafe is located across the road. This charming hotel really did contribute to our enjoyment of Paris and we will definitely be staying here when we return.

<Content>An oasis in Paris After reading dozens of contradictory reviews of this hotel, we finally booked a room for 4 days in July 2005. As soon as we entered the courtyard, we knew we had found a quiet oasis in the middle of Paris. We had requested and got a ground floor room on the garden side (120 euros). The room was not very big, but functional with a modern bathroom. There is no air conditioning, but a big fan kept us cool during a very hot period in Paris. We had our breakfasts mostly at a local caf茅. We bought wine and drank it in the courtyard. We like the St-Germain area very much and the hotel is conveniently located close to a metro station and bus stops. The staff was quite friendly and we found Marie particularly helpful. She arranged for us a shuttle to CDG airport (30 euros) at very short notice. The nights were quiet and the hotel customers were respectful of others. We would definitely return.

<Content>Would stay again!! Stayed here 5 days the end of May into June. We had a triple room with everything we needed. Perfect time as we didn't need AC. Grant you, its not 5 star but we were very pleased. When you come off the street, you enter into your own little court yard. The people are very friendly and helpful, rooms were cleaned every day and beds were quite comfortable. We did not go for the breakfast there as we fell in love with a patissere(?) and coffee bar down the street. Also, within walking distance is Moufettard(?) - lots of food, good prices!!!! Also, the Mo is right down the street and we even jogged to the Seine. Everything was so convenient!!! I would love to stay here again - everything was just so easy!

<Content>Once upon a time This is a relative (I stress the relative) bargain with a nice location for those who like the left bank. Near a great market street (rue Mouffetard) and a downhill run to Isle St. Louis. But it has seen brighter days. Perhaps it is the ever more business like character of the operation as rooms are added and the cosst escalates. It's warmth has faded as had its rooms where a broken fixture from a re-do in 199-something stays a broken fixture, and the green stair carpets needing replacing are not replaced.On the bright side it has a great location and a lovely courtyard where you can sit and read the newspaper before setting off on your day of walking. I lov e the neighborhood, the morning visit to Papeterie Descartes for Liberation and a chat with M et Mme Dran. Just as is la petite from Poland who has worked at the hotel for a number of years now. You will know her from her smile, her small size, and her humor. They are the real thing to be treasured.

<Content>A magical place! We first read about this hotel in several guidebooks, then researched it further on Trip Advisor. Thank you Trip Advisor! We were absolutely thrilled with this gem of a hotel that we found to be idyllic! We had read a couple of negative reviews, and had a few reservations before we arrived for our stay on May 28, but the moment we stepped through the large double doors and into the beautiful garden setting, our fears were put to rest. Other recent reviews mentioned awakening to the sound of birds; this we experienced, but our mornings were enhanced even further by the young students at choir practice in a school just behind the hotel. Their songs added an extra dimension to the magical nature of this extraordinary find. In addition, our spacious room featured charming decorating, elegant floor-to-ceiling windows, a sizeable bathroom with a great shower, and plentiful -- and perfectly adequate -- towels. The location is equal to the hotel itself, an easy walk to a Metro stop, Notre Dame, the Seine, and the world's best ice cream at Berthillon on Ile St. Louis. Just up the street from the hotel is Ernest Hemingway's first Paris home, and the very Parisian neighborhood is filled with a wide range of restaurants and delicious patisseries. If Paris itself didn't have so much to offer, I know we would have spent more time in the hotel garden. Perhaps on our next trip....! We couldn't have been more pleased with this beautiful hotel and its exquisite grounds. Can't imagine finding anyplace more wonderful than Hotel des Grandes Ecoles -- especially at the very reasonable price!

<Content>Good location, poor amenities The hotel is very well located with easy access to the metro and a nice garden. Lots of cafes and restaurants around it. However, this hotel does not offer any bathroom amenities. NOTHING! The towels are freyed, old and completely worn out. They most definitely need to be replaced. Our double room consisted of two very narrow single beds put together. Breakfast is very skimpy and highly over priced. Will not use again.

<Content>Country Inn feel in the Heart of Paris We loved the Hotel des Grandes Ecoles! The hotel is very clean and reasonably priced, and the staff, for the most part, very helpful and fluent in English. We awoke every morning to the sound of birds chirping outside our balcony. The private courtyard was a nice oasis in which to enjoy a cup of coffee and some pasteries from the excellent bakery (a block away) before a long day of sightseeing and a bottle of wine afterwards. The location is excellent, within easy walking distance of many of the key sites in the Latin Quarter and along the Seine, not to mention some excellent restaurants. The area around the hotel is bustling with students and other hip youngsters in the evening and night, yet the hotel is incredibly quiet throughout. The only complaint I had was that the walls were thin, which meant that you could hear the elevator going up and down. This is a little thing, but I did find it a little irritating at the beginning. On the whole, however, we were delighted with the hotel and look forward to our next stay. Merci beaucoup!

<Content>Such a Gem! My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in November 2004. We never imagined the charm we would encounter. Opening the big wooden doors from the street, you are enveloped in a charming cobblestone courtyard surrounded by lovely old buildings which house the rooms. It is a small and intimate setting.The room we had was extremely small. However, we booked a lower price room. Since the rates are so reasonable, next time I would go for the higher price range or ask for a larger room. We peeked into the room next door to us and it was much larger and more comfortable looking. The shower stall was extremely tiny.We absolutely loved the location of the hotel. It is in a charming corner of the Latin Quarter, and the surrounding streets are full of cafes and sites to see. The hotel is very centrally located - 10 minutes to the Seine and Notre Dame. When we go back to Paris, we will stay here again. The hotel greatly added to our enjoyment of Paris!

<Content>Ask For A Big Room I think there may be some nice rooms at this hotel (across the courtyard from the main buidling) but we sure didn't get one. Extremely small room (double bed only) and as another reviewer mentioned no amenities in the bathroom. How this hotel got three stars from the French bureau is beyond me. My boyfriend is 6'6 and I'm no slouch at 5'8 and there was literally no place for us plus our bags. And no place to unpack anything -- a total of TWO hangers in the closet! We had to leave the room to change our mind! We were booked for 6 nights but beat it out of there after one sleepless night. And the busy wallpaper pattern with matching drapes was something out of a bad 1950's movie. Not to mention the lace bedspread, lace table cloth and doilies on the nightstands. Truly a nightmare.

<Content>A ripp-off at Grandes Ecoles A real ripp-off, extremely overpriced. The rooms and beds are very small and unconfortable. You have to bring you own shampoo and earplugs are advisable too if you don't want to be disturbed by the other guest. The only good thing they have is their backyard, but who goes to Paris for a backyard??? For this kind of money it's easy to find a far better place to stay in Paris. The only thing you probably won't have then is the fake romantic feeling the Grandes Ecoles pretends to have, but who's waiting for this?

<Content>Romantic getaway in the Latin Quarter With a hard-to-beat location and garden setting, we most enjoyed our 6-night stay at the Hotel des Grandes Ecoles. The staff is extremely friendly (especially the breakfast servers), and we found the room to be very clean and surprisingly quiet for a hotel in the city. If you are looking for lots of amenities (TV, etc), you won't find it here, but if you seek good value in a charming and peaceful small hotel close to the metro, excellent restaurants and small streets perfect for strolling, I highly recommend it. I only regret it wasn't warm enough to take coffee in the garden, but that's Paris in March!

<Content>Loved Hotel des Grandes Ecole Have just returned from Paris France on Friday 04/02/05. Spent 4 nights at Hotel Des Grandes Ecoles in the Latin Quarter. This hotel is in an excellent location for all your sightseeing. The rooms are small and very parisien, they are cleaned every day and breakfast is at a supplement if you so wish. We had a lovely time staying here, there is a lovely courtyard to the front and it is very safe and quiet.   From our hotel we were only 5 mins walk away from the Pantheon and only 10-15 mins walk from Notre Dame Cathedral. We walked everywhere in paris including the Sacre Coeur, never had to use the metro underground. Our hotel was within walking distance for bars, restaurants etc, highly recommend La Vulcan, food was superb along with the price 鈧?4 euros for two people for 3 course meal, drinks not included but they don't start serving until after 7.00pm.  If you are staying in the Latin Quarter and are looking for a pub at night and your french is not the best then go for a quiet drink to The Fifth Avenue Pub on Rue Mouffetard. The barman Roddy is from Glasgow and is a real gentleman, we had the best of craic with him and the other barperson Annmarie from Dublin was lovely. They have satellite tv and show all the big sport events.  Its best to shop around for snacks during the day. For breakfast outside of the hotel find yourself a columbas cafe, two teas and croissants were only 鈧? euros for two, we paid double that elsewhere. We also used the Le Marche FranPrix supermarkets they were very reasonable for sandwiches drinks etc and then eat them as you walk along or there are plenty of nice places to sit and watch the world go by.  If you are going to the Sacre Coeur walk through the Opera District and up through Montmarte it's absolutely beautiful don't take Boulevard Sebastopol, not nice at all. Beware of the guys at the bottom of the Sacre Coeur who will try to stop you and sell you bracelets made from wool strings for 鈧? euros a piece, its a rip off but they do it with such charm, that you aren't aware until its too late.  Do try to speak the language whilst you are there, in our experience the french really appreciate it if you at least try, even if its incorrect. They will speak back to you in English if you get into difficulty. We only had basic school french but it got us by  PS Recommend the Paris Shuttle from Charles De Gaulle airport to the door of your hotel, service was excellent well worth the extra few euros.  Traffic in Paris is an experience all of its own, an absolute nightmare especially around the Arc De Triomphe.  Paris was everything I thought it would be and more, a truly romantic city and the architecture was superb, we had a great few days there.

<Content>cute, not a bargain This is a very cute hotel, but rooms are tiny with no tv, radio, etc. Decor can be a bit much- matching flower wallpaper  bedspread. The bathroom was rather large and very clean. The breakfast is nice and service a bit quirky, but definitely not a bargain. I don't think I would stay here again for the price I paid.

<Content>Absolutely loved this place! My wife and just returned from a 6 day stay at this hotel and loved it. It is more like a BB than a hotel (which was great for us). It had all the charm that we expected.The rooms were simple but clean. While the amenities were few (no TV, no clocks, no shampoo), the atmosphere was perfect and quaint. (And plenty of hot water.) At first, we didn't like the lack of amenities. But as the manager said, now you have to talk to your wife and it proved to be very calming.The location was very calming and interesting at the same time. The local Place was filled with great restaurants. A metro stop was a block away. Grocery stores were convenient as well as creperies.The only negative was the breakfast. It was not great and we decided to bring in breakfast each day. We bought fruit, croissants, yogurt and juice. It was half the price and a much better breakfast.That being said, we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Not worth the trouble I have been to Paris over 30 times, so know the boutique hotel offerings well. This one does not hold up against the others of lower price and in the same area. Problem: You will receive three things in your room, towels, soap and toilet paper. You will not get a mini bar, shampoo or other items, no tissues, no radio, no TV--and worst of all the morning croissants are inedible. I'd say they are frozen dough baked when you order them because they come to the table warm. Not one of the five of us could eat them. The location is not convenient either; the closest Metro station requires you to change trains no matter where you want to go in central Paris--and if it's at Chatelet, you know as a pain that is. What a big disappointed this well touted hotel turned out to be.

<Content>Perfect Location We stayed in Paris for a week and loved this hotel. Close to Metro and Notre Dame. Rooms are sparse but comfortable. Just up the street is a brasserie where we had cafe au lait and baguettes every morning!

<Content>Perfect location A friend of mine from work recommended this hotel and I stayed there in February of 2004. It's a charming place in a quiet courtyard off the street, but near the heart of the Latin Quarter. I'm not surprised this hotel is so popular. Book far in advance!

<Content>Grandes Ecoles oasis! My husband, Sister and I spent ten days in Paris, five of which we stayed at the Hotel des Grandes Ecoles. The next time we will book the entire vacation at the Grandes Ecoles. What a wonderful little oasis! Very quiet, serene, and comfortable. The garden patio gave us an opportunity to chat with other visitors over wine and snacks in the afternoons. We exchanged up-to-date recommendations about what to do and what to miss in Paris. Thank you for the recommendation!

<Content>Hate to say it - but this is easily the best value hotel in Paris At this Hotel, there is no city noise - just a beautiful courtyard garden and singing birds. It is in a lovely location, with a local bar and restaurant area only a few metres up the hill; a great food market on Saturdays just nearby and a short walk down to the Seine if you want to stretch your legs. The rooms are roomy with nice outlooks over the gardens. It is not the latest in decor, but charmingly French country if you know what I mean. The owner, a lovely elderly Frenchwoman, ably assisted by a girl who has alway worked there. Top value - but hard to get into; try now!

<Content>Ready for Rive Gauche? This is a great place to experience the Left Bank. Hemingway stayed across the street and wrote A Moveable Feast that talks about his experiences in the neighborhood. Get up early and stroll to one of the many cafes where you can sip cafe au lait and watch the school kids scurrying to school and the shopkeepers washing down the sidewalks in front of their businesses before opening.We had a very nice, large room (#217) with a curtain that you could use to close off the sitting area from the bedroom. Almost felt like a suite. Two windows to look out over the roof tops of Paris. The owner was very friendly (even waved to us one day) but you usually deal with the staff who were friendly and very patient and helpful. They will be glad to give you a cork-screw and wine glasses for the bottle you discovered at the local wine shop. The hotel is halfway between two Metro stops. One runs north-south and the other runs east-west so you can get anywhere in the city easily. It's also about 1 or 2 blocks from a 2000 year old Roman Forum that is now a place to watch the kiddies run around instead of gladiators trying to kill each other.For $119 Euros, I don't think you can do much better. We didn't miss having a TV but a 'frig. would have been nice. No A/C but we didn't need it in September anyway. We skipped the 8 Euro coffee and bread and I just went to the patisserie (1 block up the street) for fresh croissants, then next door to the charcuterie for a selection of quiches (which they will warm for you), then a couple of doors down to the market for orange juice and yogurt and fruit for a lunch snack. Then back to the room for a great breafast for about 3+ Euros/person.Would stay here again in a minute!

<Content>Paris is on my mind. I can tell you the accomodation, location and people were charming, warm and helpful from the maid on up. The front gates secured by electronic swipes opening up to the cobblestone courtyard adorned by the colours of the garden was a welcoming site each day. The Parisiene room was quaint, yet roomy, the windows opening into the laneway, the quiet surroundings all made our retreat as perfect as we anticipated. The neighbouring bistro, cafes were plentiful in local and International offerings. The Patisseries we still long for. Downhill to the Seine, short jaunt to the Metro, passes delivered right to the hotel made transportation easy at the Museums, Metro and Buses. Concierge arranged a fabulous night at the Lido. The only surprize turned out to ba a taxi who happened on our luggage at the gate hurried us away and charged us 52 Euro instead of the 30 we had expected. We arranged for a shuttle to the airport and thought he was it. Rather unfortunate but Paris and le Grande Ecole immerge triumphant in our magical whimsical Anniversary holiday to Paris.

<Content>Hotel des Grandes Ecoles - a left bank gem We have been guests at this charming hotel on many occassions, most recently August 2004. We are always welcomed like family members and we wouldn't stay anywhere else. Clean, comfortable, pretty rooms. Great location. Extremely reasonable rates. We particularly enjoy the breakfasts in the courtyard garden. Easy to make reservations via the net, but don't leave it till the last minute!This delightful hotel is our Parisian home away from home, and we have shared the experience with our children and grandchildren, who love it just as much as we do.

<Content>Great location Great little hotel. Breakfast in the charming courtyard and walking distance from St. Germaine, The Isles, The Bridges and the Seine. Some body odor in the pillows was upsetting but our room with bath was spacious and the stay very enjoyable. Staff was great in dealing with two strangers with no French from reservation to daily needs.

<Content>Very romantic, ideally located, good value We found this hotel to be charming, ideally located, comfortable, and spotlessly clean. Our room was of good size, very comfortable bed (two twins pushed together and made up as one), and opened on to the hotel's quiet courtyard. We were there the last week in June so lack of AC was not an issue. We appreciated no TV. Hotel staff was a bit distant but always courteous. The neighborhood is ideal, quiet, full of university students and places to eat and sit, and away from the hustle and tourists down by the Seine. Yet one can walk to Notre Dame in 10 minutes, and the subway in 5 minutes. Returning to this neighborhood for dinner each night was a relief and joy. We will stay here again!

<Content>Charming, excellent staff, but make sure you don't get a small room! The location on the Left Bank is excellent, the lobby and rooms are clean and well-maintained. The staff is helpful and will speak English or French (and was tolerant of mine). We had a nice view of the garden. The experience would have been a superior one if the room had been larger. As it was, the double bed was not much larger than an American single bed (let alone a queen) and there was not enough space to store two medium-sized suitcases flat. So I would hesitate to go back unless I could be sure of getting a significantly larger room. If you are an American who needs more protein than a Continental breakfast can supply, breakfast sandwiches and coffee are available at a neighborhood boulangerie for less money than the hotel's standard breakfast.

<Content>Made Us Love Paris! This is an absolutely wonderful place to stay! It is a short walk from the metro, and when you enter the gate to the hotel it opens up onto a truly picturesque and relaxing courtyard that left us believing there can be no better place to stay in Paris! We were here for two nights ($156 a night) and wish we could of stayed longer, and almost felt guilt about leaving for the day to see the sights it was so nice. The location itself is very quiet and the room was immaculate, and we found all the staff to be very friendly. Just around the corner are small streets and alleys full of restaurants, shops and small grocery stores - but there are no hordes of tourists all about. When we return to Paris in the future this is the only place we can imagine staying!Before we left we had read reviews from others saying when they arrived their reservation had been cancelled. We did everything by e-mail and confirmed it a week before we left. All I can say is we had no problems of any kind. In a way I wonder if I should write this review because we don't want it to become so popular that we won't be able to stay here again!

<Content>Watch out for the OJ Stayed here with my mother for two nights before an apartment we rented became available. We had no problem with check in. We had the building across from the main building. It overlooked the front patio. My mother, in her early 70's wasn't doing well from jet lag. She felt BAD. I went looking for some tea for her and they built me a little tray with hot tea on it for her. It was very nice. The rooms was fresh, clean, small, but lovely. We were glad we were there for a short time, because although perfect for lovers, it was too close of quarters for me and my mom. The bf was very continental, but skimpy. The coffee WONDERFUL. I saw someone with juice and I asked for some and found I was charged $4 for each glass of OJ. (apparently, juice was not included in the price of BF) It was very good juice. Mom had two glasses. This was after already paying a pretty substantial fee for BF, and thought this was over the top.We had problems with a calling card we had purchased. The advice they gave me didn't work. Apparently I had been sold the wrong type of card and so... just lost my money. They didn't intervene in any way to help. So I have mixed reviews. Most important, my mom had a problem with the steep hill from the metro to the room. After trekking around Paris and up and down stairs, she just hated facing that steep climb back to the room. The room DID have lift, which she appreciated. All in all, it was nice for the price. Not recommended for anyone with a bad knee or with any disability unless you taxi in.

<Content>Perfect location on the Left Bank My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our 30th wedding anniversary in May after much researching of hotels on the internet. The hotel lived up to all expectations - and the location was perfect being only a short walk from both the Cardinal Lemoine metro and Notre Dame and the River Seine. Our first floor room in the garden building overlooked a very pretty courtyard where we enjoyed a bottle of wine before going out to one of the many nearby restaurants for our evening meal. We only had breakfast once at the hotel preferring to walk to the Rue Mouffetard nearby where we enjoyed an excellent breakfast at the Cafe Mouffetard. We would definitely stay at the hotel again when we next visit Paris which hopefully will be very soon!

<Content>It is okay...... You read the reviews, you think you are in paradise....True, the hotel is charming, and the area nearby has everything you need and more restaurants (sushi, french,italian,argentinian,iranian,greek,etc) a good grocery store and a very good bakery (with cafe-au-lait at the counter, an excellent value), a nearby metro station, etc.We had no problem with our reservation. We were told two nights in a bigger room to the courtyard, three nights upstairs, and that was exactly what we had. Very little interaction with the hotel personnel, and they were okay. Yes, there are some flowers in the yard.....and yes, you can sit and open your wine there too, but beware of inflated expectations. I would go back, it was good value for the price, and that is the reason I would give it four out of five.

<Content>Nice place to stay, it felt French. My family of 4 enjoyed this hotel and its location during the first week of April,'04. Our quad room, 150E, up a spiral staircase, was as large as your typical Holiday Inn room and very clean. (Note: no TV). Two pastry shops were 1 1/2 blks away in either of the 2 directions outside of the hotel.  We especially enjoyed the rue Mouffetard, only one block away. A very livey area in the evening, with many reasonably priced restaurants and small bars. Seemed to be visited by many university students. There is also a small grocery/wine shop on the little square, good for buying that bottle of wine to enjoy in the hotel courtyard. The hotel has a drawer full of bottle openers. Plus, we found the French people to be very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Okay but nothing to write home about Knowing Paris from previous visits, we decided to make it our honeymoon destination as well. We were in search of a small, charming, quiet hotel and after doing some research and reading the reviews we decided on the Hotel des Grandes Ecoles. The hotel was well located, within it own neighborhood of local restaurants, bars and cafes and a ten minute walk to the Latin Quaters and as such we did not opt for the hotel breakfast which is rather pricey considering the nearby options. Certainly, the staff was nice and helpful. The rooms themselves were on the smaller side but not unreasonable and the bathroom/shower was modern and clean. As the hotel is within a courtyard there was no disturbing street noise. On the otherhand, the beds were extremely soft- squaky soft, the kind that can give one a backache. Although we had no street noise, we could hear everything in the hallway and the adjacent rooms. We knew there were no television sets so if that is a necessity for you, be warned...the radio (an ancient 1950's thing) did not work. All in all, the hotel was well priced, charming and well located but it just needs some basic updating.

<Content>terrific staff My daughter and I ended our European trip in Paris with a two-night stay at this hotel. It was during the very hot part of summer 2003. Even with record-breaking temperatures and no air conditioning, our room remained cool.  I realized (as we pulled into King's Cross Station in London) that I had left my new Canon digital camera in the bed table drawer in our room at the Hotel Grandes Ecole. My daughter called the hotel from the station. We were told the maid had found it. We requested theysend it to us and charge our credit card for shipping and handling. About two weeks later it showed up at my door in California, beautifully packed and in excellent condition. The note with it read, No charge this time. Next time you pay.And Americans say that the French are rude! What a great (and honest) staff.

<Content>Serene Sanctuary Travelling all the way from Down Under can be an exhausting experience; But arriving in the calm courtyard was pure bliss. I stayed in one of the garden buildings. To be woken gently by the sounds of birds and children playing in the nearby school was a delight. The rooms are neat and far from cramped. The service is efficient without being overbearing. It is hard to believe this oasis is close to such artistic and culinary action! This truly is a sanctuary in the heart of Paris.

<Content>Excellent value, good overall experience My family of four stayed at the HGE for 4 nights during March. Rate was 145Euro which is excellent for four people. Breakfast was optional and not pushed in any way. Did not have much contact with staff who were polite and friendly but not overly anxious to help. You wouldn't believe the reservation book- it looks like every room's bookings for a month was on one page- written in pencil and erasures everwhere- looked like scribble so I can understand how some reservations may get lost. After below postings, I double confirmed our reservations by email and everything was fine. We shared a quad room which was fairly large- about the size of the average double/double in the US. The second bed was a fold-out couch and reasonably comfortable. The bathroom was updated, clean and modern with a stand-up shower and shower doors and good towels- bring your own shampoo. Room was a little tired, fairly worn carpets and bedspreads but overall was nice enough for my wife who is extremely picky. Hotel is quiet. The outer door is locked at night and we felt safe. Location is good- about a two block downhill walk to the metro station, half mile to Notre Dame. Not too touristy neighborhood and not many shops in immediate neighborhood. Definitely would recommend walking a couple of blocks north to the market street for the 5th Arr. where it appeared mostly locals go to shop for produce, meat, bread, etc. This market area was similar to Rue Cler but fewer tourists, I thought. A couple of nice bake shops were near the metro station- great fresh baguettes, pastries and sandwiches. Here's my take on the districts of central Paris comparing with Manhattan: If you want shopping and hustle-bustle like Times Square and 5th Avenue, choose the 1st and 2nd Arr., if you want more like Greewich Village, choose the 4th, if you like Soho, choose the 6th, if you like the upper west side, choose the 5th or 7th. Paris was very cold in March, sometimes staying in the 30's and windy. The gardens were dead and grey. When I return, I will shoot for late Spring or early Fall. In conclusion, I would recommend Hotel Des Grande Ecoles for overall value and a good location. I would stay there again.

<Content>Not a great beginning, but loved the garden setting Interesting to read about other negative experiences with Reception at the hotel. While our interactions were unfailingly polite, there was an incident that did give me pause.We had reserved a room at 120 euros in one of the other buildings, not the one with the office. We were confirmed and had confirmation in hand. We showed up well before check-in time, showed the woman at the desk the confirmation--no problem, but of course the room was not ready yet, so we left our bags. She told us to come back in an hour.When we came back, she said the room was just about ready and offered us a seat. Then two American couples came in. They had just been shown their rooms and, with the exception of one gentleman in the group, they were not satisfied with them. It was quite embarrassing to listen to them and their complaints--no elevator, room too small, etc. I gathered that they had never stayed at a small, two-star European hotel before and were expecting something much more grand. They threw such a hissy fit that we suspect the woman at the desk gave one of the couples our room just to shut them up and get rid of them, for we were then told that our room--which was supposed to be ready in ten minutes--wouldn't be ready for another hour. When we came back, we were assigned to a room just off the office, which was less expensive than the room we had reserved.Since we were only going to be there for two nights and did not plan on spending much time at the hotel, we really didn't have the heart to engage in a tussle with the desk clerk. So we took the cheaper, less desirable room and made the most of it by drinking wine in the garden each night.Reading the previous posts reinforces my suspicions regarding the squeaky wheels who were oiled with our room, however!The proprietress, Mme. le Floch, was absolutely charming and there are things that make this hotel very special for its price, but I think it may have become a victim of its popularity.

<Content>The secret garden of Montmartre We have just returned from five days in Paris, in this charming quiet hotel. Everything was perfect - our room was excellent, the view to the garden was very nice (magnolias were flowering), the beds were very good and, even in the middle of the Quartier Latin, the place was very quiet. I never ever slept so well in a hotel! We hope to come back soon.

<Content>Wonderful! This hotel was everything that I expected...charming room, quiet location, friendly staff... a great little oasis after a long day of city site seeing. One night we dined at a little restaurant down the street named Le Volcan, which had good food at reasonable prices and a good selection of half bottles of wine (go left from the hotel and veer right at Cafe Descartes) Some day I hope to return when the weather is warmer so I can take full advantage of the courtyard and garden, which was beautiful even in February!

<Content>Love it! We absolutely loved this hotel! We made our first trip to Paris in July of 2003. After reading many guide books and interner reviews we booked this hotel for our 5 day stay. We were not disappointed.. it was a wonderful oasis! What a lovely setting! Our room was on the top floor of the garden building and we looked down into the garden. We loved the area it was in and the ease of walking to the Seine or down to the metro stop. The Place du contrascape area and Latin Quarter area was just what I imagined Paris to be! We would love to go back to Paris as it was truly magical and we absolutely would stay here again! PS shower was great and had glass doors .. unlike many of the hotels that I read about.. also the bathroom had a hairdryer too!

<Content>My favorite Paris Hotel - Loved it This is my favorite Hotel in Paris. The square just up the street with its little fountain is traffic free on Sundays and is were the locals hang out watching the world go by, you get a real flavour of Paris. its about a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame and about the same to the Sorbonne area. Just down the street is a metro station.We stayed for a week in July 2003, our room was small, but lovely, on the top floor of an old house, with an elevator so if stairs are an issue this building would be fine. The Courtyard was an Oasis of calm at the end of a very hot day of walking, the tables and umbrellas just what we needed, people just sat and drank wine and ate snacks they had purchased locally, recharging their batteries before heading out for the evening. Lots of very interesting and good resteraunts locally, we chose ones from Rick Steves Paris, which is where we found the hotel listing from.The breakfast was very fresh and typical of a real continental breakfast, the coffee and juice are delicious. I can't wait till I can go back again.

<Content>Comfortable, good location, good price We spent a week in room 108 of the main bdg (where the front desk is located and breakfast is served). the room was very quiet - the window opened over the garden. The room was small, but not too small, that is we were very comfortable. The staff was very helpful, pleasant - unlike the description in some other reviews. We made our reservations early and confirmed the week before we arrived by email and everything went very smoothly. Great location - we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>One to cross off your list Ever had the disagreeable experience of receiving a written confirmation of reservation from a hotel and then finding out on the day that you had been crossed off the register and had no room. Well, it happened to us (Oct 2003) at the Hotel des Grandes 脡coles, and rather than admit their error, the management threw us out into the street with a torrent of abuse.Two months before, I reserved a large single room for myself, my wife, our 3-year old daughter and my wifes mother. Id told the staff that I wanted two rooms and they said that they would let me know if these became available. In the meantime, I booked the 4-bed room on my credit card and received written confirmation. A few days later, I called them back and the 2 x 2-bed rooms were now available. I asked the hotel whether they needed written confirmation of room change, and the gentleman on the desk said that it wasnt necessary.Now, assuming that hed forgot to pencil in the change, we should have had our original 4-bed room, but when we turned up on the night, they first claimed that they were full and when presented with their written confirmation, found that our name was indeed in their book, but that a mysterious line had been drawn through it.While we had to go elsewhere for the night, the desk clerk was a model of politeness compared to the general manageress. When we confronted her the next morning, she first tried to claim that we had no reservation, then when we showed her the written confirmation, she claimed that I had the same surname as one of her regular clients and had been crossed off as a no-show. She also claimed that I was lying about speaking to a male receptionist to change the reservation, since in any case, they had no male receptionists who could have changed it (we saw two while we were there). When I pointed out that a) I had a completely different first name, address, E-mail address and country of residence, all of which appeared on the fax I sent them and their return confirmation fax, b) if they had no male receptionists, we should have had our original room, c) in any case, the reservation was secured on a credit card, she launched into a tirade of abuse, the gist of which was that clients who changed their reservation were a ******nuisance that they were too busy to deal with and that what had happened was entirely our fault. You dont have to be a genius at logic to see the inconsistencies here.I can rule out a linguistic misunderstanding as I speak fluent French. I can thus only conclude that a high priority client leaned on the manageress, who gave our room away at short notice, and the fact that we had stayed there before and were travelling with a young child/elderly relative cut no ice with her. Granted, everyone makes mistakes. What irritated me sufficiently to want to sit down and circulate our experience around the Net, though, was her incredible arrogance and disbelief that she had done anything wrong. I go to Paris about twice a year, and am a regular at half a dozen hotels, so it wasnt hard to find a suitable replacement. I can imagine that our experience would be much more distressing for a non-French speaking novice traveller. So please take note it happened to us, and since this hotel seems to be fully booked most of the time, it may well happen to you too!PS I see that the lady above seems to have had a similar experience.

<Content>The epitome of Paris- in our room! I only have good things to say about this hotel. It looks very plain Jane from the street, but once I opened the gate door, I was overwhelmed with the charming beauty of it's quaintness. We had french windows opening onto the courtyard. In the morning I could hear school children singing in the choir- it was the best. We didn't try the food but there are dozens of restaurants within mere minutes of walking, bakeries to die for. For sure, it's the only place I'll stay in every time I get to Paris!
