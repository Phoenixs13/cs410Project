<Content>Bit disappointing We stayed at this Marriott Residence Inn in Dallas TX area for 4 nights on a combined business/pleasure trip. We traveled with family and family pets. Random thoughts:* Checkin was easy but asked for low floor room for weeks in advance and the only one available at checkin was a handicap room. We took it but the bathroom area was not ideal (no tub)* Garbage disposal not working* Double beds vs. Queen beds. * Hot breakfast was mediocre (compared to a MRI we stayed in October 08)* Room was very clean* Pool / hot tub was closed the entire time we were there even though they advertise it as being open year round. * No oven (only stove top) There is plenty of other fine hotels in this area and I probably would go somewhere else if I was traveling again.

<Content>Okay overnight stay Stayed at the Dallas Park Central Residence Inn for 1 night on a family trip to Dallas to see the King Tut exhibit. Overall a pretty nice hotel and we felt comfortable and perfectly safe there with our small children. Good freeway access and the hotel was easy to find. We upgraded to one of the 2 bedroom suites. The room was clean. There were 3 TVs, but only 1 worked. The room also came with a fireplace that would turn on with the flip of a switch, but it was broken.

<Content>an adorable Hotel I used this hotel for guests of my son's wedding. It was such an adorable hotel. It reminds you of an upscale apartment complex. It was very compact and cozy and the breakfast buffet was very good and we all got a kick out of the make your own waffles in the shape of the state of Texas. The staff was extremely friendly and gave us very detail printouts of directions even to the nearest Wal-Mart. The taxi that one of our family members ordered to go back to the airport arrived so quick they were not quite finish with their breakfast. It was very clean and the rooms spotless but it is very easy to miss because the hotel sign is very small and you pass it before you know it. I highly recommend it and would stay there again, very convenient to I-635 and 20.

<Content>Great except for the mattress The four of us (two adults and two teenagers) stayed here for a couple of nights. We loved the hotel because the room was so spacious and clean and we rarely heard any other guest. They had a nice pool, hot tube, mini tennis court and basketball court. The workout room had 2 treadmills, 1bike, 1 stairmaster and a few weights. The breakfast was wonderful - a large selection of healthy and unhealthy items. You can make your own waffles in the shape of Texas! Everything tasted fresh.Our only complaint was that the mattresses were too hard. I asked the front desk about this and they told me that the management plans to change the mattresses in July. They told me that is the only complaint they ever receive about the hotel. However, the pull out sofa was very comfortable according to one of our college age children.The staff here was exceptional. They were always friendly and helpful.The location is great too because it is right next to the expressway. We could never here it because most of the rooms are in the back.It is located in a business park but there are many restaurants and shopping just a few miles down the road.

<Content>Worked Great For My Family Forced out of our home for 3 nights due to work on our house in Feb. Two bedroom /bath suite was $169. Cost compared nicely with smaller suite hotels in area. This offered more room for a few more $. Definitely room enough for family of 5. Place was quiet, clean and staff was great. They didn't seem put out by having to deal with a family (with 3 boys) at all. Breakfast was normal RI offering - great. stuff, plus a free buffet dinner that worked for us. Made being out of our house as painless as possible. Would recommend to any family needing temp. living quarters.

<Content>A positive experience... This is a fantastic hotel with a warm friendly atmosphere. I have two children under 3 and we were spaciously accommodated in one of their two bedroom suites. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were soft and fluffy and we had 3 TVs - one in each bedroom and one in the livingroom!! The rooms were quiet and there was no traffic noise. Our room was cleaned, towels were changed, new toiletries were left and our supplies of coffee/sugar were replenished daily. We all loved the breakfast buffet which changed daily. The swimming pool and out door hot tub were a fantastic place to retreat to after a long day of sight seeing. This is a great place to stay and we will certainly stay with Residence Inn on our next vacation.Congratulations Residence Inn Dallas Park Central you have created a warm and comfortable environment for the weary travelling family.

<Content>Clean, Comfortable, Quiet  I stay at the Residence Inn Park Central every time I take a workshop at the Cooper Institute 2.2 miles away. (The Cooper rate is $95 a night + tax.) The drive from DFW Airport is a straight easy 13 mile shot east on the LBJ Freeway. On both stays (the other stay was in May 2005), it was easy to find a space in the parking lot. The staff is always friendly, and helpful with maps and directions. On both stays, I stayed in an efficiency that came with a full kitchen that included a full-size refrigerator, oven, stove and microwave. The kitchen was stocked with some basics including plates and silverware for four, glasses, toaster, colander, and measuring cup.I found my room conducive to getting a good night's sleep. The sound proofing in this hotel is better than your typical Marriott. Although I could hear occasional noise from the rooms above and next door, it was much more muted than the noise I hear at a Marriott Courtyard and other motels. It also helps that a lot of business people stay here who have to be up early in the morning. The bed was comfortable, although the sheets had a low thread count, so were a bit rougher than they could have been. I was able to completely close the curtains and liner for a very dark room. Also helping with a good night's is that the place feels safe with a deadbolt on the door and keycards needed to enter the building. The room is less conducive to watching TV, as the TV faces neither the bed nor the couch. (It's possible though that being on the end, I had a unique layout.) My biggest complaint about the room is that it's difficult to regulate the room temperature with the analog thermostat. Setting the needle to anywhere in the 60s made the room too warm. I'm impressed that the entire unit was quite clean on my first day and after every housekeeping visit鈥攃leaner than your average hotel. One day I was running late and left some dishes in the sink, and returned to find them all clean.I didn't use any of the amenities, except for the business center computer. There is only one computer in the business center, so I had to wait a while for to use the computer with its ancient flickering monitor. The next night the internet hookup wasn't working, so I had to do without. (Had I brought my laptop, I could have used the free highspeed internet in the room.) I noticed that there was a small, very unimpressive gym, and a coin laundry room for guests. Most night's there's a buffet dinner downstairs. On Valentine's Day, lots of people were eating the lasagna with salad, and munching on the chocolate hearts the motel provided. The atmosphere in the common room area is congenial, with people eating, watching TV and playing cards, much like a bed and breakfast.Overall, I'm quite impressed with the Residence Inn Park Central, and highly recommend it, particularly to business travelers, people taking Cooper Institute workshops, and people who need to stay in the Dallas area for a few weeks to a month.

<Content>Great stay Stayed with my wife in a 1 bedroom. The hotel was very clean and the staff were personable. Easy access to LBJ freeway and Central Expressway. The happy hour and small buffet every day was much appreciated. I was pleasantly surprised with the professionalism, cleanliness, and reasonable pricing for extended stay housing. The smaller presence of this inn compared to others gave it a more homey feel.

<Content>great suites, good location, service needs improvement We stayed one week at the residence inn dallas park central. Our 2 room suite was great, with 2 bathrooms, 3 T.V.s, full kitchen, perfect accommodatios for a family of five. The complimentary breakfast was above average with eggs, biscuits, bacon, sausage, waffles, fruits, etc. The location of the hotel is two freeway exits of distance to galleria mall. What I didn`t like is that one day they forgot to clean our room, I called the front desk at 6 o'clock when we returned, and they responded that there was nothing that they could do at that time, just to give us clean towels but no explanation or apologies. The 3 following days they didn't make the sofa bed or leave the sheets to make it ourselves. I enjoyed everything else except the poor service.
