<Content>Good budget stay This was our first stop during our 3-week long Europe trip. It has a great location near transit, and is also a short walk from the 'Daily Market' on Albert Cuypstraat - a convenient place to get cheap souvenirs. The van Gogh/Rijks/Stedelijk museums are about a 15 minute walk, and you'll want to take transit to the train station/flower market/Anne Frank house. Our room was on the fourth floor - up several flights of steep steps. The room was small but clean, and we shared a toilet and shower with four other rooms (not very clean). Breakfast was great, free internet, and the staff were very helpful in recommending authentic Dutch places to eat and how to navigate the transit system.

<Content>The Apartment Our flat the apartment across the street, was awesome. It was clean, large and comfortable and we really liked staying in De Pijp. Bicycle Hotel staff were very nice!! Especially the girl that let us have breakfast when we came down late, we didn't have our clock set properly and we were an hour off! Also, the guy that rented us bikes was so very friendly and most helpful. We liked having free internet too. However, we were scolded for having my friend and her husband stop by to check out our room for all of a half an hour! Also, my husband was scolded and questioned very rudely when he brought my coffee cups back to the main kitchen! Definite buzzkill after a great week, and after we kept our place so neat and clean for the staff.

<Content>Nice staff, but do it yourself The pros: The hotel is nice, near a Tram Station, a supermaket. and many restaurants. The breakfast is quite decent, and the staff is really nice, in fact they are the best feature of this hotel. You have two computers with internet acces to use for free. Reasonable price in Amsterdam.The cons: Don't expect any cleaning service while you are in the hotel. I wasn't sure if the sheets were clean or not, I didn't wanted to know but stains are not good in any bed. Stairs are dangerous, but I think it is normal in Amsterdam, Bathroom's plumbery is not very good. You can't use the computers before 8 am or after 11pm.

<Content>Bicycle Hotel is great! Cool staff, clean, good location I really enjoyed my stay in the Bicycle hotel. The hotelstaff was very cool  helpfull. They told me what the best places were to go out. I had the best party in my life!Amsterdam is the place to be! The location was great. A lot of restaurants and pubs on walking distance from the hotel. My room was clean and very nice (I liked the pictures on the wall...) I also rent a bicycle. It wasn't easy to ride on, but I enjoyed it so much... I really recommend you to stay at the Bicycle hotel. It was great!!!I'm hoping to come back next year...

<Content>Spot On Hotel For What You Pay Stayed here last year 2006 and as a professional who stays at 5 star hotels through my work all over the world Im used too staying at some of the best hotels in the world, however for what you pay for at the Bicycle Hotel I REALLY CANT UNDERSTAND WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING about this hotel.It was in a nice quiet residential part of Amsterdam, so really quiet in the mornings ie no traffic or trams going by your window every 5 mins which is a big problem in a lot of hotels in amsterdam.Its a couple on mins walk to the nearest tram which takes 5 - 10 mins I guess to dam square and the red light area, about the same for the Liedersplein as well.You can rent bikes off the hotel which is great when your drunk, BE CAREFULL NOT TOO LOOSE YOUR BIKE OR HAVE IT STOLEN AS YOU PAY THE HOTEL THE FULL ASKING PRICE FOR THE BIKE, trust me the bikes aint worth that much but you do get warned that your liable for the bikes if their stolen or lost, they provide you with 2 locks big enough to lock a motor bike up with, (We did have a problem remembering where we left our bikes after a night on the beer mind you).The roomsNothing too shout aboutBut also nothing to complain about either,Clean tidy, nice enough bed, Shower, after all you only want somewhere to get your head down and have a lie in when you have a hangover.The stairs are steep, But show me an old hotel in Amsterdam that does not have steep stairs and small rooms,This is amsterdam they all have steep stairs and small rooms unless you pay for a swish modern hotel like the Marriot/Hilton etc.ConclusionPerfect for what you pay NO COMPLAINTS FROM ME

<Content>Better than expected We stayed at the hotel for four nights and found it to be a very comfortable stay. we were on the fourth floor and the stairs are very steep, pretty tricky getting your luggage up and down.The room was clean with very comfy beds, a tv and sink. The toilet and shower were just across the hall which four rooms shared. The hotel has two computers both with internet, they also hire out bikes at 5 euros a day. This is a must!!! it was a great way to get about and see more of Amsterdam although my friend struggled at first and fell off.Staff are very helpful and provide a map on your arrival highlighting the best places to eat and drink. I reccomend this hotel for anyone, we would go back again.R  GSouthampton UK

<Content>excellent value This hotel was excellent for the price you pay, it's very clean, the staff are very friendly, I would definetly go back. It's not right in the centre but it's very easy to get to and only about a five min tram ride to the centre.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel My boyfriend and I stayed here last week. Wonderful hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the room was small but extremely comfortable. Although the amoke alarm is very sensitive. But that is the worst I can say about this hotel. I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Backpacker Hotel The rooms are dirty, with mildew on the blanket, stains on the sheets and carpet. The private shower smelled of urine. The staff were nice but did not know much about their city and gave poor directions. No staff after 11. The rooms are backpacker rooms and they are worth maybe $40 US, not $80 plus. Frommers gives this hotel 2 out of 3 stars, but I doubt if they ever visited the place. Seek other hotel.
