<Content>Location, Location,Location Away from the hustle of the red light district and the central station, the quietness and location are two of the best reasons to stay here. The tram is 1/2 a block away, and the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh are only 2 trolly stops--very walkable. Easy connection with train coming from airport. See their webpage for good directions.The breakfast room, after 9 am, is quiet and peaceful. The breakfast is the typical European bread, cheese, meat and yogurt. Many business people attending the nearby convention center stay here.The bathroom was brand new, the furnishings simple, but clean and very adequate. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good Hotel - minimalist breakfast - find a free Wifi hotspot At a conference across the road at Hilton (鈧?50) so 鈧?0 great value.Single rooms small but clean, quietBreakfast is very minimalistic continental rolls cheese ham etcBest find was that around the hotel there are lots of free Wifi points but too weak to access inside hotel.So ....Take your iPod Touch go out of hotel turn left go about 20 yards and sit on nice seat outside opticians and use one of the 3 open Wifi spots I found !!Also found canals bounced wifi signal around excellently so always could get a great free wifi signal from any bridge !!

<Content>Don't know how they got 4 stars It's a 4 star hotel, the location is great but there are a lot of 4-5 hotels in the area. I choose it according to the photos they put on the websites, and the photos here on TripAdvisor.The Room was very small, and looked nothing like the picture. there was no bath, only a shower - and very small one. The chair was broken. I asked to change rooms, the front desk was unfriendly about it. as I used the soap in the room, I wasn't able to change rooms anymore for that night (as there was no one to clean after me), even not for a surcharge. As he was alone in the hotel - he couldn't help with any problem outside his post, so he couldn't get me another chair. The hair blower didn't work as well. On the second day I could change rooms (had to pay 33% surcharge, but thats fine...). The executive room was well equipped and nicely furnished, the bathroom was very nice also (this is the room they have on their site). The phone didn't work well though... Breakfast was nice, don't expect vegetables or scrambled eggs, there is also nobody in sight - one should go to reception.All in all - not a good experience, I don't recommend it...

<Content>A good hotel in a quiet area. We stayed 4 nights at the Delphi and and found it to be a great accomadation for our needs. The room was ample in size, the breakfasts sufficient and it was only a 2 minute walk to a tram stop that took us right into the city center (10-15 minutes). The hotel is outside of the city center in a very quiet neighborhood. From the hotel you could easily walk to the museum area. The people that work here are very friendly and helpful. We arrived at the hotel at 8am after a red-eye from L.A. and were, of course, exhausted. The receptionist told us that the room was not quite ready and offered us breakfast while we waited about about an hour for our room. As soon as the room was ready we were notified and we were in our room by 9am. In the area there are a couple of small stores and restaurants if you are not in the mood to deal with the city.A little warning for those individuals who are not interested only in the red light district and the coffeeshops! Many of the museums and other sights are closed or have restricted access because of renovations until 2009. Thought we had plenty to do for the 4 days we were there, we were disappointed.

<Content>Good overall, if you're a contortionist Having spent a while prevaricating over hotel choice, we plumped for the Delphi as it seemd to have the right balance between price and other reviewers' ratings. We arrived really late after several hours delay courtesy of UK snow. We were let in by a rather surly nightdesk attendant, who carried out his tasks in a perfunctory manner. Thereafter, things were fairly smooth.We had two twin rooms, both a decent size, particularly for Amsterdam. Both had decent sized bathrooms which left me puzzled as to why both had toilets which required at least one of your legs to be contorted somewhat unnaturally. I thought it was just me- six feet four tall- but all of my family had the same problem.Breakfast was OK- by day 4 the rather limited choice meant the original 'delight' was wearing somewhat thin.All this seems rather churlish, but there are many good points. The hotel is 2 minutes away from the number 5 tram, most tourist sites are really easily accessed. Overall, the staff were really pleasant and helpful. Housekeeping were efficient and unobtrusive. Fresh coffee and tea (complimentary) rather than rehydrating old packets in your room made a pleasant change.My only word of caution- don't let your kids flick through the TV channels- the adverts for the adult films are extremely graphic!

<Content>Excellent Hotel Just got back from Amsterdam yesterday. We stayed at the Delphi Hotel and I have to say that I could not fault the hotel in anyway. The room was spotless, it was extremely clean. The breakfast was typical continental breakfast with plenty of supplies of everything. The service was excellent the staff were very helpful. We arrived 2 hours early for check in and were able to check in and we were able to store our luggage at the hotel before we left for the airport after checking out. The staff were great.The location is perfect. Just away from all the noise and crowds but a tram ride away from all the sights. The trams run all the time so you are never waiting for a tram and a taxi home late at night is between 鈧?0-鈧?5. All in all excellent. Amsterdam is great.

<Content>Quaint and Quiet I am a travel agent and stayed in the city center for 2 nights before coming to this hotel. I loved it! The trams as you will read are close by so easy and inexpensive to get to all sites. We had an interior room that overlooked a quiet courtyard. Staff was excellent. Requested a taxi for following morning and it was actually early. It is in a residential neighborhood which was so nice and peaceful. About a block away are several restaurants, markets and shops. I will recommend this hotel for clients. No it doesn't have all the amenities of a large hotel but it is very comfortable. Highly recommend unless you are looking for a 5 star hotel.

<Content>Served us well, could be better This hotel is located in a residential area of Amsterdam and the local neighbourhood is lovely. Trams number 5 and 24 leave frequently to get into the bustling centre, and are only a minutes walk from the hotel. It was nice to be able to come back after a day out to a peaceful area.Apparently the hotel has gone through a long refurbishment, and I requested rooms in part of the hotel that had been finished. There were 6 of us in my party, and we booked 2 doubles and 1 twin. All our rooms were on the fourth floor. The twin room was the largest out of the three. The hotel is advertised as a four star, but I did not feel the double rooms were of a four star quality. They were both pretty small, and the bathroom was tiny. Our shower leaked quite badly, and there was not much leg room at all if you needed to sit down to use the toilet - knees were touching the wall!! As we really only used the hotel to sleep, this did not really bother us as the staff were friendly and the hotel was clean and tidy. Breakfast is typically Dutch serving only continental food. Morning rolls, toast, cereals, yoghurts, cheese, ham, boiled eggs. Good selection. No tea or coffee facilities in the room, but you can order complimentary tea and coffee at any time and it is brought to your room which I thought was a nice touch. Plenty of English speaking channels on the television and room cleaned to a good standard each day.All in all a good stay and yes, I would stay there again.

<Content>Great little hotel We made our reservation at this hotel based on favourable reviews in Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. We were given a non-smoking room as we requested. Although the decoration of the room was rather old-fashioned, it was a decent size, the bathroom was modern with a large tub and shower over. Bed linen was clean and attractive. The hotel is in an upscale neighbourhood away from the crowds but with trams No. 24 and 5 at the corner we were whereever we wanted to go in no time at all. On a rather hot evening we walked to the Vondel Park and enjoyed seeing the many family picnics. The staff was friendly and extremely helpful and there was a very nice breakfast in the morning. If you are looking for an American type hotel with bellboy services etc. this is not it, but we would stay there again any time.

<Content>worked well Just back from three nights at the Delphi. (03/05) Great rate in a quiet area of South Amsterdam. Good Breakfast, friendly staff, and near the 5  24 Tram Lines. 15 min walk to the Museums. Had a rather large bright corner room which worked well for us.

<Content>Decent Place We stayed here in late February for 2 nights and found that for the price you pay (approx 100 Euros per night incl tax and continental breakfast), it is a decent choice. The rooms are a bit outdated in terms of decor and furnishings and if you travel in the colder months....be warned of the poorly insulated window sills and minimal control over the heat. In addition, our room was on the 2nd floor. One morning, I ventured up to the 3rd floor and noticed that it had most definetely been remodeled with newer carpeting and wallpaper. I asked the front desk about this and was advised that the hotel is undergoing a slow renovation (I assume so as not to disturb the guests). Bottom line, if you stay here, ask for a room on the 3rd floor or above. On another few notes, the hotel only offers a basic but good breakfast in the morning and other than that, has no restaurant. There is however, a great Italian trattoria called Dal Barone, just around the corner and down one block on the right. Great food and decent prices! In addition, for people not familiar with the layout of Amsterdam, this hotel is not located in the heart of the city, but rather about a 15 minute tram ride from Dam Square and 20 or so from the Central Station. It is in the Old South section of Amsterdam and in a beautiful upscale neighborhood of tree lined streets. Much preferred over the packed city center and some rather seedy areas!!! You can also walk from the hotel to the Museumplein (Rembrandt and Van Gogh Museums) and the Concertgebouw with relative ease.

<Content>An excellent bargain! I just got back from staying four nights at the Hotel Delphi, and I highly rec. it! I got an amazing deal online from the Best Western website (52 euros/night including breakfast) and it was great! The hotel is in a very nice, upscale part of Amsterdam, only a few minutes walk to the 5 and 24 tram lines. This will get you to the Leidseplein in 5-10 minutes. I have always stayed near the Leidseplein before, but i will go to the Delphi again. The room was large and very clean; there is a lift so that you can get your luggage upstairs without breaking your back on those famous A'dam staircases, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was a GREAT way to start the day--they offer coffee, tea, milk, juice, cheeses, meats, yogurt, fruit, boiled eggs, several kinds of breads, jams, chocolate spreads, honey, butter, cereals--it's a great deal! The only main disappointment I had was that the site said there was wireless internet available--yes, that's true, but it costs 22 euros plus tax for 12 hours! forget it! the guy at the hotel agreed, and he pointed me to the internet cafe :) my bed was comfy, though, there was a sofa in my room, which had tall ceilings and big windows that overlooked a courtyard. i also had a shared balcony, satelite tx, a shower and tub, and a nice desk. yay for the hotel delphi! :)

<Content>Quiet and safe place to stay The Delphi is in a quiet part of the city. There is a beautiful park area adjacent. It is just a short walk to a scenic canal. There is a convenient tram stop just a short walk away. The room was larger than most I have experienced when I have stayed in Amsterdam. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The breakfast was very nice each morning.The adventure of riding to the old part of the city each day by tram was a highlight of the trip. This is a very good, quiet place to stay in a beautiful city.
