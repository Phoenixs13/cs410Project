<Content>Great hotel This is a lovely hotel with very helpful, professional, friendly staff. It's slightly off the main road in an area that seems to be mostly offices (and the German Interior Ministry building, complete with police presence), so felt very safe indeed. There are a couple of lovely restaurants on the same block, which is great for when you've just arrived or if you don't feel like venturing into the city of an evening. The 'Lanninger' bar looks out onto the Spree and some lovely buildings opposite, with seating on the riverbank for warm evenings. The hotel does cycle hire, which I'd recommend; Berlin is as flat as a pancake and with the cycle paths you can't go wrong. Riding around the Tiergarten on a sunny day was just great. The hotel is also handy for bus and U-bahn stops. The room was clean, modern and spacious, and had air conditioning. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for hanging clothes. I would definitely go back to this hotel.

<Content>Solid room but DRILLING from 8-5 every day!! Nice hotel, tucked away down a side street. AMAZING breakfast buffet every day of the week. Room was standard, but gets high marks for lots of surfaces and shelves, good lighting and a good bed. Heat didn't work in our room 2 of the 3 nights. They are remodeling and put us on the floor nearest the drilling or jackhammering. Here's the catch-22: we were too worn out from fighting the tension of hearing the drilling to pack up and change rooms. Ditto for another couple in our group. Can't imagine why they would place any guest near that noise. They get terrible marks for neglecting to attend to a quality guest experience. If you want to book here, check first to see if any renovations are going on. It has potential, if they put you in a quiet room and if the heat works. The staff had a somewhat disdainful attitude.

<Content>Nice hotel, BUT be aware of the beds We stayed in the Spreebogen Berlin for two nights. The hotel is very nice, clean, staff is very friendly, the breakfast is one of the better ones I had. The only thing which doesn't make this hotel top is their beds. They're absolutely dreadful. Very bouncy so if it's two of you on double/king bed every time one person moves the other one does as well... If you travel to Berlin via car, the hotel is quite close to the Main train station and it's well hidden on the Alt Moabit Street. It's by a river, but in a courtyard!! So we drove past couple of times before we found it. The hotel doesn't have own parking lot, so you have to use a public parking (which is underneath the hotel) and will cost you 1.20EUR per hour or 17.50 EUR per 24 hours.This hotel is about 25 minutes walk from the Brandenburg gate; about 40 minutes walk from the Check point Charlie so I recommend you use the public transport. But overall Berlin is a great city and I'm sure you all will have a good time!

<Content>Fantastic Of all the hotels we stayed in during our two month trip, we rate this hotel most highly.Check in was handled seamlessly, the staff were helpful and informative. We paid a rate of Euro 80 per night and could not get over the value for money. It was excellent.The total experience was very positive. Excellent room, bathroom, facilities, cleanliness, location, price. It scored full marks on all counts.Breakfast was amazing. Wall to wall food choices with every taste catered for.The bus directly to the (TXL) airport departs from the road (lt Moabit) directly behing the hotel.When we go back to Berlin, that is where we shall stay. Highly recommended.

<Content>Comfortably adequate I too have stayed in a number of hotels throughout Europe. I feel it was moderately priced. The hotel was certainly clean, well situated and convenient and I felt very safe. The breakfast was pretty outstanding as hotel buffets go. All of the help spoke English and were very helpful with directions etc. I have to agree with some of the other reviews however. The bed left a lot to be desired. It was in essence a box with about an inch or so of foam padding. The pillows were horrible. Folded in half it might be about as thick as an airline pillow. Overall, I was very pleased and would definitely consider staying there again if the price were right.

<Content>Could not ask for better If travelling to Berlin, you could not ask for a better hotel. This is preety much brand new (at least in the last year or 2)... The hotel is spotless. All staff I dealt with spoke english and were helpful and happy. The room was large and bathroom fantastic... The internet was a little expensive and there is only 2 computers available... (one with no mouse??)... There is a great little bar/cafe in the corner of the foyer and openm quite late for a coffee or beer before retiring to your room. Overall, you could not ask for much else.

<Content>Nice modern hotel, convenient location, fantastic breakfast The hotel is a 10-minute taxi ride from Tegel airport, and a 5-minute walk from the nearest S-Bahn station, from where you can get to many places in Berlin within a short time. The standard rooms are average in size, but very clean and comfortable. The bathrooms have the typical German efficiency to them - no luxurious touches here. The breakfast buffet is fantastic - choices galore, though the typical North American traveller will miss some items. Live a little, and go the European way! The staff are very helpful, and will gladly try to help with any extra requests you may have.The price for the hotel is usually quite decent, given the quality and location.

<Content>agree with others but...... most of the other postings are accurate in terms of location, style, etc,etc. the one item worth noting about this hotel though are the beds. Having stayed a large number of hotels of equvalent to 4 star ratings in germany, I was surprised to see the total in adequate beds in this hotel. Basically the bed is a box spring set that appears to by 20+ plus years old with a 1 inch thick piece of foam covering it. Stay away from this place if you have back problems like I do. Spend the extra money and stay at the Ritz. oh, my aching back.....................

<Content>Great Hotel I can only agree with the others reviews. It's a great Hotel in a beatiful setting, very quiet, and thanks to the S- bahn very convenient for most important sites. We were lucky to stay (for 5 nights) in a huge room with beautiful view on Spree. All the pros that have been described are accurate (nice decoration, very friendly staff, excellent breakfast). The only disantavantage is that the neighbourhood of the hotel is too quite, you can't find restaurants or bars close to the hotel. The only restaurant which is very close is an italian one called Scusi, which I am not recommending.Btw Berlin is beautifull, perhaps the most interesting and nice modern city of Europe.

<Content>Hidden Treasure We stayed at the Sorat last December and all I can say is that it was a great deal. We stayed three nights and spent ~100 Euro per night. The Hotel is located right on the Spree River in a part of town used by the Interior Ministry. The Interior Ministry is right next door. It's all new construction next to a warehouse district that has been refurbished into chic bars, restaurants and office buildings for the Interior Ministry. Although not in a real touristy area, it's location only added to the appeal in my opinion. Because it was out of the way, prices in the restaurants, shops and bars were much more reasonable.The Hotel is well maintained and the room was standard size for Europe. All the amenities (wet bar, shower, TV, etc..). Breakfast buffet in the morning was excellent with omlettes made to order and the full range of other items (fruits, breads, cereals, daishes, etc...). Hotel staff was friendly, curteous and multi-lingual.We were a little concerned about the lcation since we wanted to see the sights, but an S-Bahn station was a 5 min walk down the river from the hotel and 10-15 minutes later we were at the Brandenburg gate.Bottom line, a very nice hotel in an out of the way location made this a great deal.

<Content>Beautifully Situated on the River Just north of the main action in central Berlin but in a beautiful location on the river. A pleasant walk away from the Charolottenburg Palace and an easy bus ride from everywhere else. A train station is nearby as well.My room was a corner one high up and had wonderful views of the river and the attractive art nouveau houses on the opposit bank. Lots of trees.The bathroom was the ultimate in luxury and the room was light and airy (you could actually open the windows) and a great breakfast buffet to start the day.
