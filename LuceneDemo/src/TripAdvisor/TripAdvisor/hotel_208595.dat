<Content>Only Location The only good thing about this hotel is its location in the citycenter (pl. Catalunya). The rooms are pretty small and not clean enough and the shower did not work properly. Also, the breakfast is very basic and does not worth the price paid for it.

<Content>Well kept secret We were in Barcelona in August and wanted to stay near Los Ramblas. We stumbled across the Hotel and spent 4 nights there. It was clean and the staff were very helpful. all staff spoke English and went out of their way to advise us on where to go. they arranged transport to the airport and generally were great.the hotel is a 2 star but the rooms are clean. The bathroom has a bath with a shower.The best thing about the hotel is the location, close to los ramblas and Catalunya square. You can walk just about anywhere and the metro is also very close.

<Content>great location, hotel could use some improvements The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect. However, I would probably stay at another hotel next time. The rooms need a little updating - decor wise and amenity wise. The A/C barely functioned, but we were there in August in the brutal heat. We had a double bed that was two small twin beds pushed together. Breakfast was fine. The staff was great. The rooms just need some updates for this hotel to be a better experience.

<Content>Perfect I would concur with all the recent reviews. Perfect for a couple of days in Barcelona. Clean, quiet, pleasant staff and excellent position. What else could you ask for? My only surprise is that it's not much higher in the rankings.One tip! I usually find that dealing direct with the hotel gets you the best deal. Not in this case. I got a price from this site and rang the hotel direct. They couldn't come near it. So I booked on line and made a substantial saving.

<Content>Brilliant location and nice hotel My boyfriend and I travelled to Barcelona for the May bank holiday weekend as it was also my birthday. We had booked to stay in an apartment on the outskirts of Barcelona, however, on arrival we were absolutely disgusted by the apartment and only stayed the one night before finding Hotel Cortes.We had been wandering round Las Ramblas asking in a few hotels for prices, and this is just at the top of Ramblas, just off the main street down a quiet side street, this was the cheapest hotel we had been into and the reception even gave us the key and let us go have a look at the room before we booked it for the next 2 nights which we thought was really helpful. It cost us 拢130 for 2 nights and this included breakfast.I usually won't stay in anything less than a 4 star hotel, so was a bit aprehensive about stayng in a 2 star, but anything had to be better than the apartment we'd stayed in! The hotel actually surprised me! The rooms were basic and a bit tired (which is what you'd expect form a 2 star), but very clean and tidied daily, and they were also extremely spacious, as was the bathroom! I stayed ina 4 star hotel in Barcelona in January 2008 and had about half the room of this hotel The breakfast wasn't anything to write home about, just a selection of pastries and some oranage juice, but there was a gorgeous bakery a few doors down where we got some really nice stuff!The location is probably one of the best things about this hotel, it is right off Las Ramblas so you're in the heart of everything and is the perfect base for exploring. To be honest when staying in somewhere like Barcelona all you want is a good base as you go out and eat in the city and you're out all day seeing the sights, and this hotel is just that.Although I still prefer my 4/5 star luxury hotels, if I'm staying in Barcelona again I will definately book here next time, and would def look at lower rated hotels when going on other city breaks!

<Content>Great hotel- Excellent location Great hotel to visit Barcelona. Really central, just on a sid street off Las Ramblas. Very near La Plaza de Cataluyna where the airport leaves you. The tourist bus that goes around the city leaves from there too. For those who like shopping, El Corte Ingles Fnac and all the other stores are nearby. There is also a big shopping centre about a 15 minute walk down Las Ramblas and down by the pier.The hotel was clean. The room was cleaned and the towels were changed everyday. There was a t.v. in the room. The staff were very helpful. Breakfast was fine although there was no choice. The hotel was quiet even though it looked out onto the street.Wil definitely stay here again as it is so well situated. Excellent option

<Content>Location, location, location! We stayed two nights for my 40th birthday. The location is excellent as the Plaza Catalunya square and the Ramblas are both 2 mins away. We took the local bus from the airport to the Plaza Catalunya square which cost 4 euros each. They run every few minutes to and from the square. The hotel (we were in room 108) was more than adequate. We over looked the front of the hotel but were not disturbed by any noise because of the shutters and double glazing. We found the staff helpful, the rooms very clean and a nice sized bathroom with bath  shower. The breakfast consited of pastries, buns, cheese, ham, orange juice  coffee. I recommend the tourist bus tour to see all the sites. We went on the red line first where you must get off and visit the Parc Guell (where the famouse moziac lizard  walls are. If the weather is nice, as it was for us, you can sit, have a drink  enjoy the atmosphere.) We then swapped to the blue line to see the olympic stadium and the coast. The tour is 20 euros for 1 day or 26 euros for 2 days and you see so much. There is a fantastic maket off the Ramblas which is also worth a visit, even just to see the non UK perfect sized fruit  veg!

<Content>Dirty bed-sheet and no effort of a receptionist to help change it Everything was ok exept for the cleanness. The sheet had a rather suspicious fresh brown spot right in the centre. After it was shown to the receptionist, the answer was: I cant help you, the cleaning lady comes only tomorrow. My reply: how do you think we can sleep on it? Reply: I don't know, my job is reception. So we had to sleep on it after moving the spot somehow to the side. Very unpleasant adventute and we'd never recommend the hotel in spite of it's good location.

<Content>Close and Quirky Located 2-min from the Plaza Catalunya it is exceptionally close to the center of Barcelona, thus Metros, A1 Airport shuttle and Information Center. The front desk staff is nice and helped us make a few phone calls and locate restaurants on the Internet and the housekeeping did well by us. English BBC is available on tv. The continental breakfast are 3-pastries, coffee and orange juice. Thankfully there are many Starbucks and Dunkin'Coffee's around. The quirks are: your room key operates the lights/tv so at night you have to manage finding the door locks (they dont lock automatically) with your hand while navigating the key to the lock from the wall. The bed was almost too uncomfortable to imagine. Our room faced the street which is noisy until 2000 and again at 0500 with deliveries. The bathroom was large but the showerhead provided entertainment by being broken. We felt safe in this hotel but it wasnt comfort. It was extremely affordable for the location! They will hold your luggage if your room isnt ready/you check out before you leave the city. There are no clocks in this room. Does it depend on the room for all these issues? I suppose so.

<Content>Great location Nice hotel in side street off Les Ramblas. Ask for a top floor double with balcony/terrace with views across the roof top(Room 508/).Breakfast is at back of bar next door , just tea/coffee oj and 3 rolls/cakes. But ok to get you started.Speak english on reception, Has a lift and good value Street feels safe at night.

<Content>Perfect little Hotel We stayed in this hotel for three nights, excellent, The rooms were bright and airy and very clean, the staff on the whole were very helpful, it is situated just five minutes walk from the main square, easy to get to from the airport on the bus, i would definitly use this hotel again, their were six of us, four young at heart pensionersand two younger ones, One tip, if you are staying for a few days, buy a two day ticket on the tourist bus as you would never see all the sights otherwise, also you have to pay an entrance fee at most of the sites.

<Content>Don麓t ever book it I booked a room in this hotel about three months ago in Venere.com and as I did it with some anticipation, they gave me a great deal in the room price. When I arrived to the Hotel, they told me I had made a reservation for a single room, one person, although I had made it for for two persons. In any case, they first told me that they had rooms for two, but it will cost me the double they had said in Venere, and when they saw I was furious, they told me they had no rooms for me and my wife. They sent me to another Hotel which is conveniently placed just in front of Cortes. They had one room and charged me what they wanted for the it (150 Euros per night - too much for a one and a half star hotel), because Barcelona was packed with people and no other rooms available in this part of the city. It was clear to me the two hotels have this procedure in their minds since they propose the huge deals to early bookers, so my advice would be DONT BOOK THERE...

<Content>The perfect hub Although I enjoy being pampered by four or five star facilities, there are cases when there should be a trade-off between certain things. Hotel Cortes is the (only and) best 2-star hotel I have ever stayed at. Located in a small pedestrian street leading to Las Ramblas, it is within easy reach of some of the most exciting sights of Barcelona. ( 2mins to the Ramblas and the underground station, 3 mins to the Catalan Square, 5 mins to the Cathedral, 10 mins to the Music palace. The airport bus drops you off at the Catalan Square.) I had a single room on the 4th floor which was tiny but unbelievably clean. The room had the basics only, do not expect a minibar in a two star facility. The TV and the fresh daily towels were a pleasant surprise as was the AC and the hairdryer. Reception staff were extremely kind and helpful. It might have been the length of my stay (8 days) combined with the friendliness of the staff that it was like going home when I returned to my hotel in the evening. There is a health-food restaurant right next to the hotel which is perfect for solitary female travellers but the restaurant opposite was also OK. The only thing I did not like about the hotel was breakfast. The breakfast room was in an adjoining restaurant, you had to go through a smoky bar to get your continental breakfast not earlier than 8. My room overlooked the courtyard and was very quiet. I do not think there could have been a more conveniently located hotel for 鈧?0 per night in Barcelona.

<Content>Great Location Stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago after reading several reviews and was glad we did.While not perfect and certainly not a luxury hotel ,it was clean, and despite our rooms being at the front of the hotel we heard very little noise(we stayed mid week so it may possibly be noisier on a weekend).The breakfasts were fairly poor but were served in a clean bright room leading from the bar. The bathrooms were clean and kept stocked with clean towels etc and the air conditioning was very good.The location couldnt have been better, being just a few minutes from the Placa de Catalunya where the buses to and from the airport stop and also the Bus Turistica, and Las Ramblas being just at the end of the street as well as there being plenty of shops of all types and restaurants.Iwould have no hesitation in staying here again and at 660 euros for three nights for two double rooms in July I think it was well worth the money.

<Content>Great post cruise hotel! The hotel is located on a side street off La Rambla, and only a few minutes walk to Placa Catalunya where you can catch the subway, tour buses and the airport bus. My room was clean, with marble floors throughout. The bathroom was spacious and had a wonderful and powerful shower. However, it is a tub and it can be slippery. Breakfast is included and consisted of a plate with a croissant, pastry and roll, followed by plates of ham and cheese. Coffee and orange juice is provided as well. Just enough to get the day started. Great location, very friendly and accomodating staff. Will definitely stay there again and highly recommend it!

<Content>Excellent central location good value Just returned from 2 night break, first time in Barcelona so wanted central location. This hotel was great, clean rooms, pedestrian road - safe, well lit, plenty of cafes and shops in our road. At end of Santa Ana one way you are on Las Rambla, with lots to see - other way, you are right in main shopping area. No tea making facilities in room, (we had travel kettle) but they do supply shampoo etc. Safe in room. Reasonable breakfast. We had room on top floor overlooking street, which was fine. I would go back here again. Beautiful interesting buildings everywhere. I carries most of my money in belt as had been warned of pickpockets, but felt safe here.Only problem for me as a vegeterian was that Barcelona does not cater AT ALL for non meat eaters. I had to ask for cheese omlette which was lovely, but usually NOTHING non meat on menu, and they obvioulsy thought I was mad asking. This would be a problem if I were staying for longer trip.

<Content>Great Location - Close to the action We (me 27, husband 29) have just got back from a lovely 3 night break in Barcelona, staying at the Hotel Cortes, based just off La Ramblas. The hotel is basic, but clean and the location is excellent, close to all the action. From the airport we took the AeroBus, which cost 3.75 euros each and drops you off at Pl. Cataluyna 鈥?very easy and straight forward, it is then just a short walk to the hotel. The breakfast they serve is a good kick start to get you going for the day (Bread Roll, Croissant Pastry, Cheese, Ham, Orange Juice and Coffee). There was always plenty hot water for a shower or bath. We stayed in room 201, which was spacious and overlooked a small courtyard. For being so close to the bustle of the city the room was very quiet which made for a goodnights sleep.The location was ideal for the sightseeing. We would recommend taking the bus turistic, which is an open top, hop on hop off bus service which takes you to all the sights, again leaving from Pl Catalunya. There is a north and south route and for 23 Euros you can use this for 2 days. We visited the Sagrada Familiar (go early and take the lift up to the top for amazing sights of the city), Parc Guell (lovely for a stroll in the Feb sunshine), Barcelona FC鈥檚 Nou Camp Stadium (hubby loved this as a die hard football fan and was an amazing sight compared to his home team鈥檚 Goodison Stadium, also the European Cup is based here as Barca won it in 2006 鈥?even have your photo taken with it ), Cathedral (Lovely courtyard with geese!!) and the Picasso Museum (lots of his early work, great to see how it evolved). Would recommend all these and to spend sometime wandering around the Gothic Quarter and sitting by the harbour if the weather is nice (which it was while we were there, getting to around 20 degrees at midday 鈥?such a change to the British weather in Feb.)Would also recommend trying to get a table at El Quattre Gats (鈥? Gats鈥?, we had a lovely meal here and the atmosphere and service were excellent. Also ate at Hard Rock Caf茅, which you know what your going to get, but has become a bit of a tradition for us to visit one in every city we go to.For those of you who like shopping there is plenty available 鈥?El Cortes Ingles in Pl Catalunya is huge, Sephora for smellies is nice and there are many Mango  Zara shops dotted about.All in all we had a fabulous few days in Barcelona and would not hesitate to go again and stay at the Hotel Cortes as there is still so much more to see and do in Barcelona.Hope this review helps

<Content>Excellent Location We stayed in the Hotel Cortes for 2 nights in February 2007. The location was ideal for the sightseeing we came to the city to do. Ariving in Pl Catalunya by bus from the airport it is a short walk to the hotel. The breakfast they serve is a good kick start to the day, and they serve fantastic coffee.There always seemed to be plenty hot water for a shower. Only down side is the mattress was a little hard for our liking, but otherwise an enjoyable stay.

<Content>a little gem I recently stayed at the Cortes Hotel for 1 night. I was so surprised to find it was so close to Pl. Catalunia and the Ramblas. I think it is a little gem and I would have no hesitation in staying there for a longer period. although I was in a single room, which was small but perfectly adequate with all the facilities that I needed, .When I asked the receptionist about their double rooms, I was offered a key and was pleasantly surprised at the size of a double, with a balcony. I must mention the Receptionist (Christina) she was so helpful and spoke perfect English. The continental breakfast was more than adequate and all i all, the overall cleanliness of the hotel was excellentPeter Ollerenshaw, Isle of Man

<Content>Great position for visiting Barcelona Returned on Saturday from a fantastic few days in the beautiful city of Barcelona.Hotel Cortes is in a great location being on a side street just off La Rambla. Hotel is pritty basic but the beds are comfortable and the water hot for showers/baths. Breakfast is enough to give you a kick start for a busy day. Reception staff do not speak much English but will help you as much as possible, a little Spanish goes a long way. We stayed in room 203 which faces a small court yard therefore nice a quiet. I am planning to visit the city next year and will hopefully book this hotel again. Tip, dont take a taxi from the airport hop on the local airport bus which leaves every 10 ~ 15 mins this drops you at the top of the Triangle, ( 3rd stop ) near El Court Ingles. Turn right cross the (very !!!!! ) busy street into Avenue De L' Angel and St Anna ( where the hotel is ) is the first street on your right. the bus will cost 3 Euros 75c what a bargin. This bus stop is also the place to catch the bus Turistic.We had a fantastic few days  did loads but there is so much more to see.

<Content>Cosy  We arrived at the bus station tired and hoping for a short walk to the hotel which is exactly what we had. This hotel is ideally located to all amenities, off the main streets but whether you turn left or right at the front door you find yourself in the middle of all the fab activities of Barcelona. Hotel was clean, rooms attended everyday and the bar staff were very friendly and welcoming. One complaint, I booked a double room and on arrival was told there was no double room available so we had to satisfy ourselves with two single beds - if all the double rooms were filled then my booking should not have been taken or at least the situation explained to me.Overall, Barcelona is such a beautiful City and the hotel was clean and convenient the double room was soon forgotten about. Would definitely recommend this hotel for lucky travellers to this incredible city.

<Content>Good Budget Hotel Have just got back from a 3 night stay at the Cortes  enjoyed it. Bottom line is that we paid 90 Euros per night for a double room and got what we paid for i.e. a no-frills budget accomodation with limited amenities. If you want 5-star, pay 5-star prices. Okay, we were 'fortunate' enough to be allocated a front-facing room on one of the lower floors - not such a bad thing except the property opposite was being renovated at the time and Bob the Builder decided to start work at 7 a.m. (who needs an alarm clock when you've got Bob and his hammer drill !). Add to this the fact that the refuse truck calls around at about midnight to empty all of the bins, cars  bikes goung along Santa Anna throughout the night, and the the street itself does seem to have a drunk / begging problem and you'll get an idea of why the hotel is inexpensive. All of this didn't perticularly affect us as we've been in worse, however the place may not appeal to travellers of a sensitive disposition, or lifes born complainers.Plus points are an adequate breakfast, location (obviously), and reasonably attentive staff who all speak English. Despite the minor niggles I'd recommend the place if you're on a budget (just ask for a high floor !)

<Content>Great hotel and value! I stayed at Hotel Cortes for 4 nights and had a wonderful stay there. It is close to everything and has a wonderful feel to it. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were impeccable. I travelled as a single and had a room with twin bed (70 Euro) and window overlooking a courtyard and cathedral. You hear the bells chime and it adds to the charm of staying in Barcelona, they stop at midnight. The rooms were quiet and the air works terrific, a t.v. in each room. Breakfast was an assortment of 3 breads, coffee and orange juice, the servers are very attentive. Remember to bring a wash cloth if you use them, as they are not provided. I would definately recommend this hotel for anyone wanting an upscale type of hotel without the cost! The location is great!

<Content>Hotel Cortes The Cortes is located at 25 Santa Anna street, one block from Place Catalunya down the Angel pedestrian street. Cost about 102 E/ night for 2 persons with breakfast. The street runs between Place Angel and La Ramblas. Location could not be better. The airport bus stops at the corner at the top of the pedestrian street Angel so it is an easy walk. The street has several restaurants, shops, and a pharmacy where they speak English. The Hotel is clean, AIR CONDITIONED, quiet, with elevator, and the management speaks English. Breakfast is Coffee, 3 breads or rolls, and OJ. Enough to get you started. You are in the heart of Barcelona. The Bari Gothic is just a short walk, as are the Art Museum, hundreds of stores and several Internt Cafes. Try the 4 Gats restaurant on a side street off Place Angel. It is famous, old and grand. BUY a phone card for 5 Euros. State specifically that you want one to your specific country. Ours worked great and gave us 5 hours of calls. Bought it at the Tabac on Santa Anna, English spoken there too. The Touristic Bus is the best deal here, for 17 E it takes you all around the city on its three loops for one full day. The guides speak all languages and are knowledgable. It is a hop on and off deal that works and goes to everything, even the train station. A two day ticket, 22 E, is the best deal if you have time. You catch it at the corner of Place Catalunya and Las Ramblas or anywhere along the route. Cash only. Take an evening ride on the blue line for a great sunset view over the city. Taxis are reasonable, but NOT to or from the airport. If taking a cruise, use the airport bus to PC, and then taxi to the port. You can walk it acutally down the Ramblas but the boats tend to be way out on the quays so it would be a hike. Go to the Ramblas and get a taxi. Best Deal. Take the big blue Airport bus for 3.60 E cash. It leaves from right in front of the B terminal exit where you come out from getting your luggage. It takes about 25 minutes. Makes 3 stops and brings you to Place Catalunya. Rush times may be standing room only, so just wait and be first on the next bus, if you have the time.Barcelona seems to be a clean friendly city with lots to offer. Enjoy

<Content>location,location,  Nice little Hotel in the heart of Barcelona, easy access to many sites. Like a previous review, breakfast is marginal(but free). Good restaurants all around, the Hotel reccomended  4 Gats which was great. Good restaurant next door. Great City, been there twice and cant wait to go again and see more.
