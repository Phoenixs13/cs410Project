<Content>Mixed Feelings for This Hotel This is my first stay with this hotel. It's lobby is very stylish. The good thing for me is that it comes with free internet in the lobby as well as in the rooms. I stayed in the 1st floor and in the room there is always a slight stench probably from the drains or something. The room is quite dim for my liking with only 3 lamps in the bedroom.

<Content>Great Belart value Booked on 1800hotels.ie. Very pleased.Lovely quiet location, strolling distance of Ave.Gaudi with al fresco cafes with SagradaFamilia at end of Av.Gaudi.On yellow line metro alfons X but bus 92 going to the Port (and 14) outside the door and other buses within a stone's throw of the door.We used bus 92 to get us to the shuttlebus for cruise port (at Mirador Colon) - easy peasey. Staff lovely, friendly, helpful and know the city. Bedroom functional, adequate, clean, fab air-con (quiet) but the skimpiest curtains I've ever seen.I also got a wonky bed, one of a twinbeds.My husband's bed was grand. Good maintenance.Breakfast excellent.I've no hesitation is saying its a great value for money hotel in a tranquil area.

<Content>Much Improved This is our third stay at Bel Art. Location is good as a couple of miles from the Rambla and local bars/restaurants good value.It is close to metro line 4 that runs to the beach.Hotel has improved and deserves four stars with a free breakfast on our reasonable rate and limited free mini bar also. Rooms spacious with free safe in room.Staff helpful and polite-a real gem of a hotel

<Content>Comfort at the Confortel..... My partner and I stayed in the Confortel Bel Art on the 1314 May 2008 before boarding a four day cruise on the med. We also stayed on the 19 May 2008 prior to our return flight to belfast.First things first the hotel is near the Sagria Familia so is not in the centre of Barcelona or the Ramblas. But it is only 200m from the Alfons X metro station and a simple five stop journey takes you to the centre. The hotel is exceptionaly clean, breakfast is beautiful and best of all the mini bar is free. We checked in on the 19th at 9.30am and the hotel was more than happy to accomodate us with a room.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Sewer smell and misleading list of free amenities The hotel wasn't all bad, but there were several things that made our stay less than perfect.-My parents' room smelled horribly of sewage, and when the front desk was notified, their solution was to have housekeeping come and spray it with air freshener. I would have insisted on changing rooms, but my parents didn't want the hassle of repacking all their stuff. Our room, which was 2 doors down, smelled perfectly fresh.-The brochure in the room listed several free amenities including a free minibar, free WIFI in the room and several different types of pillows (foam, feather and something else I can't remember). My parents asked for feather pillows for our second night's stay and the people at the front desk looked at them like they were crazy...said they didn't have feather pillows. Umm..okay, then don't advertise that you do!-The rooms were pretty clean, but there were some stray hairs in the tub and sink (not our hair) and the phone looked like it had never been wiped down.-Breakfast was delicious but not included and, in my opinion, really overpriced - 17 euro per person (at the current exchange rate that is about $25 a person!)-Location didn't bother me, as it was within about a 3 block walk to the nearest metro station (Alfons X). I actually liked being in the residential area because it meant less street noise at night.Overall, I'd give it a 3 out of 5 - I mean, it was a nice place, but for what we paid per night I just expected a little more in the way of service and I really think that breakfast should have been included.

<Content>Good hotel and location My wife and I enjoyed a weekend away in Barcelona and found the Confortel to be a reasonable price for a clean, modern hotel. Our room was clean and spacious with a good sized bathroom.The best metro to the hotel is Alfons X. Just exit towards Lepant and it's a few hundred yards down the street on the left. 5-10 minutes walk further down the street is the Sagrada Famillia which was wonderful.The staff at the hotel were very helpful and most spoke good English. The room service is Telepizza which is a 'fast food' pizza place that delivers. When we arrived, the phone in our room wouldn't work so we went down to ask reception and they said it was better to go direct to Telepizza and directed us (it was 23:30 by now). Telepizza were rubbish and had stopped serving but let us stand around at the counter for a bit. Luckily we found Bar Ricci on the way back and they spoke a bit of English as well so it was easy to order a few Tapas and get a meal at 23:45!The air conditioning didn't seem to be working (may not have been on - it was March) but the mini-bar was stocked with water, soft drinks and some beers and it was free and restocked every day!The breakfast is good but expensive if it's not included. It was 18 euros each so we had a good 3 courses.Overall we'd stay here again as it was reasonable value for a decent hotel in a great location.

<Content>Nice hotel, but out of the way The Confortel Bel Art is a very comfortable hotel, but it was not as centrally located as I would have liked it to be. I knew going in that it was not in the middle of the city center, but I did not realize that it was in such a residential area. However, the Alons X metro stop on line four was located close to the hotel. It was nice that the mini bar in the hotel was free, but it only included drinks.

<Content>A good hotel Trying to see Barcelona at reasonable prices we found this hotel. It is located in a very nice and quiet area, not far from Sagrada Familia at 5 minutes walking from a subway station.Very nice staff, good and assorted breakfast. Rooms are clean and nice. Bar is closed too quickly and dinner is available until 10pm but arround the corner is Cafe del Teatro, a nice bistro with nice food, charming staff, very friendly and helpful, even if they don't speak English.

<Content>Wonderful hotel - just a little pricey This is a wonderful hotel - modern, clean, every amenitie you could think of and the staff is tremendous and proactive. BUT you will pay for the experience. Don't even think of opening the mini-bar. All in all though, very much worth the price

<Content>Decent place, good location Before we arrived at the Hotel I was a little worried about my choice but everything was good.Quiet location with a few bars/cafes nearby. Just down the road from Alfons X metro station from which you can get to the Barri Gothic (Jaume 1) in 10 minutes without changing lines.15 minutes walk to Sagrada Famillia and a further 45 minutes to Place Catalunya.Hotel was quiet with occasional noise from neighbours arriving and leaving.

<Content>A Good Choice Having booked this hotel on the internet I was a litte worried about the quality of this place. It turned out to be more that adequate with good customer service and clean rooms. It is located in a very good neighbourhood in Barcelona close to the Sagrada Familia (within a ten minute walking distance) and a five minute walk to the nearest metro station. The breakfast was ok though it could have used some fresh fruit on a daily basis. Our thanks to the desk staff who were always willing to help out. They even kept our baggage after we checked out since we had a late night train out of Barcelona. Thanks Bel Art.

<Content>Not an ideal Location Just returned from a 4 day break at the Bel Art Hotel, and thought an update would be good for this Web Site.The Hotel is OK, would agree that it is not a real 4 Star, as we saw other 4 Star Hotels in Barcelona that were far better equipped than the Bel Art. The previous write ups regarding being next door to a nightclub worried me (the booking was a surprise weekend away with my family). Good news it is now closed and being bulldozed!! I would not liked to have stayed there when it was open, as it would have been a nightmare.The food at the hotel is fine (again, nowhere near 4 Star), the staff OK (nowhere near 4 Star) and the bedrooms OK (yes, you've guessed the next word).The location is the hotels biggest downside. I read in the website that the hotel is 300m's from the Sagrada Famillila....Rubbish. it must be about 1.2 miles away on foot through some quiet residential locations that were not comfortable walking through. We tried the Metro the first night, got the diections from the hotel, and went by every word, and got off the Metro even further away from where we wanted to get to!! With a wife, and 2 children, I was not that impressed. You would have thought a 4 Star hotel, or any hotel that would have guests looking to get to the nearest tourist location, would have done their homework and got their directions correct!! To sum up, we taxi'd in and out of the city centre (approx 8-12 euros depending on taxi driver!) at all times.If however, you wanted to go to Barcelona, be in amongst the hype, noise and fun, but be able to taxi back to a quiter location then this could be the place for you, but I would suggest you look to other locations first.In summary, reasonable hotel, terrible location.....look elsewhere and give this hotel a miss.

<Content>Not a great location This hotel looked great in the pictures and the reception was nice, but the rooms were small-ish and not what I would consider 4 star (except for the breakfast which was exceptional). Although it was a decent walking distance to the Sagrada Familia (about 20min) it was a good 20min taxi ride to the harbour or Las Ramblas.One wall of hotel is shared with a local (non-touristy) night club which wasn't noisy but a good night out for anyone into clubbing!

<Content>Would not Recommend The hotel does not warrant a 4 star rating, does not have the facilities or services to warrant it. Hotel rooms were small  pokey however they were clean. Stayed 5 nights in Oct 06, restaurant was never open, bar had limited services, found hotel staff to be unfriendly.Location a bit far out from centre, however metro line close by, enjoyed Barcelona, would return there, but would not stay in the BelArt Hotel and would not recommend it.

<Content>We enjoyed our stay I booked two rooms through Expedia several months before our arrival. When we arrived on September 22, 2006 I was happy to find our rooms were ready and check-in was easy. The hotel is not fancy, but clean, comfortable, and friendly. The two people at the front desk, Luz and Ruben, were very helpful and kind and provided us with answers to our many quesions about directions, etc. The rooms were large and adequate and even though the nightclub next door was open late, we did not mind the noise and slept soundly. The hotel is quite far from the downtown area, but it doesn't take long by subway and the station is just a few minutes from the hotel. We felt quite safe in this area, and actually walked from La Ramblas all the way to the hotel one night after dark. (not recommended as it takes several hours). The breakfast was good, but quite over-priced. (12 Euro each) If you are looking for a simple, clean, friendly, safe hotel this is it.

<Content>Bel Smell We stayed at the Hotel Bel Art in August 2006 for 4 nights having booked 2 rooms for our family of 4. On arrival we were given rooms on the second floor. They stlll had ashtrays in them despite our request for non smoking and smelt strongly of deoderiser - we complained and were moved to ground floor rooms which were basic but clean, but still smelt of deoderiser. I suspect they allow guests to smoke in all the rooms. The staff were pleasant enough but the cleaning staff are determined to use strong cleaning products. One evening we heard them scrubbing the hall carpets outside our rooms with amonia - we had to go out to escape the fumes. They also like things strong in the hotel bar. We requested 2 white coffees which we couldn't drink - they were so strong!I feel this hotel would equate to a 2 or 3 star rating in the UK. All the rooms at the back face a buildings about 10 feet away which are also on a small alleyway down which motorcycles speed long into the night. We have stayed in Barcelona before without any problems so were really diappointed with this hotel.

<Content>Very good choice I stayed at the Bel Art in late June 2006 when I went to B. with a girlfriend for a long weekend. Overall this is a very good choice for the price (we paid around 40 euro each per night for a double room via [--], for three nights - expedia's price was 100 euros more in total). We did not have breakfast. We were not exactly greeted with enthusiasm when we arrived late afternoon; that may be due to a very large group of youngsters arriving at the same time. In any case we were given our room card and assigned a first-floor room looking out onto the street. The bar two doors down unfortunately operates a long-hours policy at weekends and a group of young people sat out on the street until 4 am which was extremely loud. As my fellow traveller insisted on keeping the window open this was a real nuisance, having said that the central a/c worked perfectly and we could have closed the window. Next morning we requested a room looking out the other way and that was no problem at all, despite the hotel being fairly full. This room was very quiet.The hotel is very clean and pleasant to look at, and the rooms were absolutely adequate with a modern and recently refurbished feel to them. The location is also brilliant - rather than the crowded and loud Barri Gotic this is about 15 minutes away from the centre by bus or metro (nearest metro is Alfonso XX, about 200 yards up the hill, and the bus down to town or to the beachfront leaves from directly outside). Sagrada Familia is about 10 mins walk away and there are plenty of small bars to have breakfast in. No complaints, apart from a minor gripe: the staff's English is not great, and they do tend to sound rather abrupt, not to mention rude, because of this. However, they were helpful about our room change and also phoned two restaurants for us to make bookings.

<Author>BON VOYAGE AMICO
<Content>Quality Hotel Bel Art is a Nice Hotel and a Great Location My family and I visited Barcelona for 3 day prior to taking a European Cruise. We were looking for a hotel that is not far from the center of Barcelona, reasonable in price, clean, quiet, and has a good breakfeast. Hotel Bel Art had everything we wanted. The hotel rooms are a good size for European standards and the hotel has a bath and shower. The staff is friendly and all speak English. The housekeeping service was good. The hotel staff arranged an excursion for us to Monestir de Montserrat, Parc Guell, the Picasso Museum. and a narrated tour of the city. If you do get a taxi however, make sure you confirm a price prior to entering the taxi. Have the hotel staff confirm the price for you if possible, since the staff can confirm the price in Spanish. Also, have the hotel staff confirm with the driver they know where he or she is going. We had one taxi driver drop us off in the wrong location and we almost missed our planned excursion. We had to walk a mile to eventually find the correct location.  We walked and visited La Sagrada Familia church on our own since it is a short walk from the hotel. The breakfeast at the hotel is very good and well worth the 12 Euros per person. The dinner at night is good, however, you would be best to stick with the price fix menu for 12 Euros per person. We took a taxi to the city center, howeveer, you can also take the bus which stops near the hotel entrance. However, you may also decide to walk to La Sagrada Familia Church and then purchase a ticket for a Barcelona tour bus, whcih will not only bring you to the major tourist stops thoughout the city, but also give you a narrative on the city's highlights. Make sure you visit La Rambla, a street for shopping and festivity. Barcelona is a beautiful city and Gaudi's work displayed in his house (La Pedrera), Parc Guell, and the most beautiful La Sagrada Familia church. La Lagrada Familia is not a consecrated church and will not be completed for 25 years, however, it is a visit you will always remember. Seniors enter at a reduced price. If you are looking for a good quality hotel then Quality Hotel Bel Art is for you. The hotel is not a 5 star hotel. However, for the price, the amenities offered, and its location it is a good value.

<Content>Loved It Just arrived back from Barcelona where we stayed at the Bel Art Hotel. Like a previous reviewer we came here by way of one of their other hotels that had problems with the lift. Whilst it is out of town, just up from the Sagredia Familia, the public transport is extremely good. Catch the number 10 bus from just across the road and this will take you straight down to the sea front. Catch the 92 bus it will also take you down to the sea but on a much longer journey. All the bus stops have a name and a map of all the stops on the route.A short walk away is the Alfons (yellow Line) metro stop. My advice is don't take a taxi into the city unless you have to. It cost us 15 euros one night when its only 1.40 euros on public transport. Definately recommend the T10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys for 6.35 euros. As long as your journey takes no more than 1.15 hours you can change onto different metro lines; tram; bus and train and it will still be classed as one journey. Fantastic. We felt extremely safe in this area. Recommend the bar next door to the hotel. There is a tapas bar a bit further down called Bar Teatre. (closed Sunday and Monday evenings) Lovely food - got a sandwich for lunch one day with a tortilla filling. Sounds strange but it's very good.Taxi from the airport cost 31 euros a bit steep but it was our first time in Barcelona and when we return we will be using the T10 tickets to get across on the airport bus and then the metro. Though difficult negotiating steps with all your baggage. Not every station has an escalator. The taxi drivers always have the meter running when they are pre-booked be warned.The hotel does a menu of the day at a very good price of 12 euros for three courses including bread and a glass of wine. Food was lovely. Plenty of choice. NB: Restaurant is closed on Saturday and Sunday evenings. Also breakfasts were excellent - a mixture of sweet and savoury which would suit all tastesWatch out for pick pockets but don't let it put you off. Be particularly careful on busy trains/metroI would be happy to recommend this hotel. The staff all speak English and they are very helpful and friendly. Hope you enjoy your stay.

<Content>Clean, comfortable and great breakfast We have just returned from 5 nights at the Bel Art after being transferred on arrival from the hotel we were booked into because 'the lift is broken'. We were advised before arrival to get a taxi from the airport but if you know the location of your hotel get the airport bus which is very cheap, very frequent and goes right into the centre of Barcelona to the square at Catalunya - you can get a bus or Metro from there if necessary. The Bel Art hotel is situated in a quiet, clean district where I felt very safe, and is just a few minutes from Alfons X metro station on the yellow line. The hotel was extremely clean, despite the fact that redecoration was in progress during our stay. No view from the window, but we didn't go to Barcelona to sit on a hotel balcony. Our room was thoroughly cleaned every day, including clean sheets on the comfortable bed and clean towels in the bathroom. Downside was the room safe did not work, more coat hangers would have been useful and TV was not satellite but Spanish channels, a couple of German channels plus CNN and BBC World with very bad reception. Single film on offer was pay per view as were more adult offerings.The breakfast was a veritable feast with something for every one with savoury and sweet, hot and cold, frequently and discreetly replenished by staff.All staff were very helpful and interacted very well in English. Reception staff always willing to help with everything from directions to the loan of a mobile phone recharger.Overall impression was clean and comfortable and I would recommend to anyone not bothered about being a little out of town.Best full meal was at Port Vell restaurant on Passeig di Joan do Borbo and best light meal was Grupo Babilonia next to Temple do la Sagrada Familia.

<Content>Beware of overbooking! After much searching we booked this hotel about four days prior to travel  receieved our electronic conformation of booking.Upon arrival after a 4AM start we were passed over to a member of staff who advised us we didnt have a room booked due to computer errors.After some discussions we were offered another hotel which was right on the edge of town. Numerous phone calls later  a deal was struck where we ended up in the excellent Hotel Corcega. In fairness to the hotel they were polite  professional at all times trying to resolve a difficult situation. There were also another couple in the lobby who had met a similar fate although they had booked in October.

<Content>Great value for money We spent a long weekend at the Bel Art, mid February and it was great - rooms were very clean, staff were helpful. Its location may not be the most convenient for the city centre but the Alfons X metro station is only a couple of minutes away - buy a T10 ticket for 10 journeys, makes public transport very cheap. Didn't use the restaurant but there are plenty of bars and eating places nearby. It was quiet too (we had our 2 children with us so we weren't staying out too late!) apart from an external door that banged throughout the night. I reported it to reception, but nothing was done - so I fixed it myself, by going up to the roof plant room and tying up the offending door with some cable I found on the floor!

<Content>Excellent choice for a mini break My wife and I selected the Bel Art from a shortlist based on previous reviews and were delighted with our choice. The staff were very courteous and spoke good English. Our room on the first floor was medium in size with TV/Radio, Mini-bar, comfortable bed and nice bathroom with plenty of towels and toiletries. We requested extra pillows and these were quickly provided. The breakfast buffet was very impressive, catering for all tastes, with friendly staff to help if needed. The Bel Art is located about 5 mins down the hill from the Alfons X metro station and about 10 mins up the hill from Sagrada Familia. The 19 bus will take you to the Maremagnum Shoping Centre in the Harbour from just outside the hotel, passing close by the front door, but comes back on a parallel street behind the hotel. The hotel does not have in-room tea/coffee making facilities but we brought our own travel kettle and bought water, milk and other necessities in a supermarket on the street behind the hotel. We thought that the Bel Art was great value for money, within easy reach of all the sights, the staff were all friendly and helpful and we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet place to stay when visiting this beautiful city.

<Content>Not so great for a sightseeing break I stayed at the hotel in early february with my boyfriend and we wanted the hotel to be a base for sightseeing in the city. The hotel is very clean and well presented, and the staff are exceptionally helpful. Even the location is not too far out as its about a 10 minute walk from the Sagrada Familia and just a few streets from a metro station. Also there are some great restaurants to be found in Gracia which is about 25 minutes walk. My main issue was that there is nothing of interest in the surrounding area and the look of the hotel is very corporate. Its a nice hotel but not one I'd recommend for people on a romantic break. If I were to go to Barcelona again I would spend a little more money and stay somewhere with some atmosphere such as the Born district or the Barri Gotic.

<Content>good value, good location Rooms are excellent, well-equipped and clean. Restaurant underwhelming, but there are plenty of good alternatives a metro ride away. Location in general is great - quiet residential area with excellent transport links.Only complaint would be the soundproofing in the rooms; like most modern buildings, it is poor. One night, we were woken up by someone breaking wind in the room next door!On the whole, however, highly recommended.

<Content>Very nice for a low price I traveled to Spain over Thanksgiving and stayed at this hotel from Nov. 28th-Dec. 2nd. I was a female traveling alone and found this area to be quite, safe and nice. There were plenty of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. La Sagrada Familia was within walking distance as well as other sites. The staff was very nice and helpful with all questions and provided a map of Barcelona. I was more than impressed with the room. For the cost (booked through Expedia), this hotel met more than my standards. The room was nice and big as well as the bathroom. Mini-bar, safe, desk, plenty of room compared to most European hotels I have stayed. I did not eat at the restaurant but, noticed alot of people dining there at meal times. If any complaint, they sprayed to much perfume smelling air freshner. All in all I was very happy with this hotel and if ever in Barcelona again, would stay there.

<Content>Great hotel find Stayed with my husband in Hotel Bel Art for 5 nights and we were really pleased with our choice. The hotel is easily accessed from the airport, we got the short train journey into Barcelona Sants, hopped on the metro and one change onto the Yellow Line to Alfons X we were there. the area was a little quiet, which was what we wanted, there were lots of really friendly tapas bars very near by and Sagrada Familia was a 10 minute walk away, which is absolutely amazing. if you want excitement we were able to get into La Rambla or the Olympia port, crazy at night!, for about 6 or 7 euro.the hotel reception is exceptionally clean, the reception staff were helpful if not over friendly! the rooms were again very clean and the room cleaning was performed every day and to a great standard. There was no outside noise and the air conditioning was great.i would recommend anyone to stay here, especially if you use the metro as the city is soo accessable when using this, and the internet rates were great value for money.

<Content>Good value for money We stayed here 5 nights . Clean rooms with TV + pay TV, mini-bar and room-safe.Reception-staff friendly and helpfull but sometimes difficult with English.Internet-rates are the best deal, especially if they include breakfast, which is excellent and with a huge choice . Normally bkfst. costs 12 Eur = expensive.Rooms are NOW QUIET since the discotheque next doors has been closed by the authorities since january !!Hotel is close to 2 Metrostations : Hospital St Pau and Alfonso X, which is only 4 blocks downhill (=south) to the hotel . There is also a busstop in front of the hotel ( nr 10 ) which will take you to the Olympic Port with dozens of restaurants.From the airport ,you can take train + metro to above stations ( I recommend Alfonso = downhill with luggage) Ticket costs only 2,40 Eur.If you buy 10 tickets at 6,30 it will be even cheaper.If you have very heavy luggage, I recommend the airport train to the Clo-Arago station; from here taxi is 5-6 Eur. Taxi from airport is 20-25 eur.You can also buy transport-cards for 2-5 days from 8,80 to 19 Eur valid on ALL public transport ( www.tmb.net) or a Barcelonacard : same as above + free and reduced entrances to all museums and other attractions : price 17 to 30 Eur for 1 to 5 days .Don't forget to try the frienly bar Bahia next to the hotel : good and cheap beer , coffee and snacks : 2 expresso's = 1,80 eur !We enjoyed EVERYTHING in Barcelona and will go back to the same hote

<Content>Very quiet Having checked a number of hotels and hotel sites for Barcelona we decided for the Bel Art hotel. Sounding ideal from what I read and very competitive on price. It was siad to have a lively Bar, close to the tourist attractions etc. etc.Granted we were a walk away from the famous Sagrada Familia and the Metro which made it an easy hotel to be based at. Unfortunately the Lively bar turned out to be very quiet indeed (just too quiet for my liking). It was always empty and at times even the bar person was nowhere to be found.Otherwise a very nice hotel if you like quiet and the staff were very friendly and helpful.

<Content>noisy on weekends We stayed from 3/14-21 and found the location to be ideal - not down town but close to attractions and the subway stops. The hotel itself was clean and the bed/pillows were very comfortable. The shower was also very nice- good pressure and lots of hot water. There are plenty of places to eat in the area. It was nice not being in the LaRambla area, which is very congested. The staff was very nice, and the rooms were a good size. (We were travelling with my 7 year old son, and an extra bed fit in the room with no problem.) My husband couldn't use his DSL line, but there is an internet cafe down the block. (I think you need to have dial up to use the hotels internet.) The only problem is the noise from the disco next door! I can honestly say, I wouln't stay here on the weekend, if I didn't plan on staying out till 5 am in the morning- when the disco closes! I think the hours are F  S until 5 am, and Sun until 1am. That being said, during the week, it was nice and quite- I didn't ever hear any street noise. I'm sure if you are planning on partying in Barcelona, the disco hours will not bother you, but since we were with our son, going out to the disco was not an option.
