<Content>Great choice in Paris!!! My husband and I just returned from a 5 night stay in Paris. We enjoyed welcoming 2009 from the Champs Elysees and this hotel was the perfect choice. We spent hours researching hotels, looking for a great location, nice room, etc at a decent price (as our US exchange rate doesn't help much). This hotel met our needs. The rooms and bathrooms were nice, clean, average size (nothing fancy - but we really only slept there and spent our days wandering around Paris). The location was the best part. A very short walk to the Arc, The Champs, the Concord, great shopping, dining and more. If you need them, the metro and bus stops are on the Champs, a very quick and safe 5 min or less. walk away. There is also an EXCELLENT pharmacy/mini grocery store 2 doors down with cosmetics, toiletries, asprin, fresh breads, foods, cofffee, wines, bottled water and nice french food gifts like truffle mayo and other treats. The train station and bus stop to/from the airports is only 4 streets away. We were both very pleased with our stay here and highly recommend this hotel. The concierge and front desk are most helpful and will make suggestions and restaurant reservations for you. My only complaint is that I could hear some noise from the upstairs room above us, we were on the 4th fl, but I think the guests were unusually loud. The woman would wear heels in the room at niight and early morning and I could hear them on the wooden floors, they had a few loud fights and I think they moved furniture around for some strange reason. Of course not the fault of the hotel- just rude guests. Make sure when you book to look for special discounts (AAA rates, Internet specials etc). We had a really great rate AAA rate on a standard room -lower than what I see from other comments here. I also didn't add photos because I feel the photos posted are a true and current representation of the hotel. I didn't give this 5 stars only because I reserve that for situation I feel are truly unique, however there is nothing wrong with this hotel and I would return again.

<Content>A Superb 5 Star Hotel The Radisson Hotel along the Champs Elysees is definitely a superb hotel without doubt! It's exactly the kind of hotel that we are all yearning for: 1) Soft sparkling clean bed2) All bedroom facilities maintained at top conditions it almost looked new3) A door partition between the bathroom and the bedroom so any business you make won't affect the fragrance of your bedroom4) Clean and dust free furnitures5) Air conditioning even in winter times so you do not have to open the windows and expose yourself to the dust and dry air.5) Bathroom is sparkling clean without any stains6) Bathroom comes with a speaker so you can listen to the tv news while you are bathing7) A good coffee maker8) Good selection of tv programs10) Prompt room service9) Fantastic concierge services10) Staffs who LISTENS to your request and satisfies them11) Situated along the glamourous shopping malls12) Situated near the historical icon Arc De Tromphe13) Situated near the train stationDuring my short 2 nights stopover in Paris, I had actually booked for another hotel near champs elysees on the internet and it had explicitly deceived me into believing that all their hotel rooms had air conditioning during winter times. Although i understand that it is usually the culture that hotels will not provide air conditioning during winter season, I needed air conditioning as I could not be exposed to winter air for a long period due to very dry skin conditions. Hence, I booked for the hotel believing their advert that they have air conditioning even in winter times. However, when i reached the hotel everything was a scam. 1) The hotel room was so small i had difficulty opening the wardrobe door.2) The bedsheets were filled with dust.3) One smack on the pillows will set the dust flying over your face! Horrible. 4) Air conditioning worked on a central control system, hence there was no way I could request for air conditioning for my room. 5) The safebox was spoilt. Needless to say, I made a complaint to the frontdesk. Only to see that they were rude and adamant about their services and the wrongly advertised information.Not wanting it to dampen my holiday mood, i went out of the hotel in search of a better hotel and that was where i stumbled up the concierge staff Radisson Hotel! Everything took a drastic change from here. The concierge was highly professional who spoke with grace, enthusiasm and politeness. Immediately they showed me to the room which is available for our consideration and offered to transfer our luggages from the nasty hotel to theirs! Their service was professional and efficient.Hence without further ado I went back to the hotel, spoke with the manager about my situation, waived the penalty payment of cancellation of hotel booking fees and dived straight into the cozy arms of Radisson!Don't despise this seemingly small hotel of Radisson, you will feel immediate elegance and professionalism of their hotel staffs right at their door step. Rest assured for a memorable holiday. A place not to be missed.Enjoy! Suying

<Content>Expect a good stay This hotel deserves a high(er) ranking in the Paris hotels scale. Given the ability to spend a seriously high amount of money here, the Radisson does an excellent job at very reasonable prices. Location, staff, breakfast and rooms are all superior quality, and you will not leave disappointed.

<Content>Location, location, location. This is a wonderful Hotel within walking distance to most of the touristy sights. The Arc de Triomphe is literally 2-3 minutes walk away. The rooms are fairly small but beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. The bathroom was gorgeous and suprisingly large with very good quality towels and toiletries. Although the hotel was almost full whilst we were there we didn't know it as it was so quiet and peaceful. Just off the lobby there is an outside terrace where they serve dinner/drinks, a real treat if you want to sit in the sun and relax after a days sightseeing. Just outside of the hotel heading right is a fantastic store, I think it is called the Drugstore . It has a fantastic deli-counter, toiletries, gifts, make-up, wine, newspapers, I could go on! We were given recommendations to eat in the evening in the St. Germain district and we were not disappointed. The area felt very safe and there was a huge choice of wonderful places to eat. Overall I was blown away with Paris, I never expected it to be quite so beautiful. For a large city it also felt suprisingly safe. We can't wait to visit again with the kids when they are older and I would definately stay at this hotel again.

<Content>good but it's just "Mordern",,,, that's it I stayed here for 2 nights. It was a week ago... When I checked in, the TV screen was not so clear and few minutes later, I did NOT watch anything on the screen and I needed to change the room from 7th foor to 3rd floor without balcony.The hotel was nothing to do me in spite of chaning my room when I was so tired.Totally, it was clean, quite area but that's it. Just 'Mordern' hotel. It will be my last visit for this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic location We stayed at the Rasisson SAS Hotel, Champs Elysee over Valentine's weekend an we had a fantastic time. For us, the Hotel was ideally located just a few yeards from the Arc de Triomphe and one street away from the Champs Elysee. It was almost like a launch pad, we could get pretty much anywhere in Paris, very easily, while if we just wanted to stay locally there was plenty to do. The Hotel itself was very cleverly renovated (from the old Louis Vuitton HQ) and is very contemporary. The room was pretty standard size for a City Centre hotel, en suite bathroom with high spec fixtures and fittings. Room service breakfast was very efficient for saving time in the morning, the staff were VERY helpful. We booked a balcony room, with a view and the view really was as it looked on the website - brilliant! The lobby bar wasn't very well stocked, but really that can be our only down comment. I'd highly recommend this Hotel and will use it again.

<Content>very nice hotel and fantastic location only stayed at this hotel for 1 night but cant complain at all, the location is fantastic, one street from the champs elysees! the room we had was very nice , great bed and fantastic bathroom with a bath as well. please be warned this hotel is on the expensive side (but then again so is paris!) a bottle of beer was 8 euros and if you can get breakfast included as its 29 euros each. had a very nice stay and its recommened.if you need to get there from the nord, its line 2 (light blue) walk to la chappelle station and go westbound, come off at champs elysees and its about a 3 min walk.

<Content>Radisson SAS is swell Stayed at this property for 6 nights, beginning of November 07 - our 2nd visit - overall a very good experience - hotel is small (around 50 rooms) so the service is personal - staff was friendly and very professional - room well appointed with separate tub and shower in bath, modern design, decent linens etc - the room was showing a bit of wear since our last visit in Mar 2006 - location is very good as just off the Champs Elysees and very close to a major metro stop - we used the metro every day - was extremely convenient - I'd stay here again and would recommend it.

<Content>Great location! What a fantastic location... right next to the Arc De T and all those great shops and cafes. Paris is everything you've probably ever heard about it. Myself and my partner had a fantastic time. The hotel was spotless, and very modern. Rooms are slightly smaller than they look on the website, but I think most hotel rooms in Paris are probably the same.The area is fantastic, very quiet at night. We decided against eating in the hotel as there are so many wonderful cafes to get breakfast, lunch or dinner throughout Paris. The cafe at George V is wonderful. Great desserts!!!The staff are very friendly... and excellent at dining recommendations. The downstairs in the hotel is a little lifeless though... perhaps it's the time we went, but mainly consisted of business men looking very depressed over there bourbon on ice.All in all I'd recommend this hotel to anyone, if only for it's great location.

<Content>An above average experience I chose this hotel based on the reviews from other trip advisor comments and was not disappointed. The hotel was lovely. It was small and charming, warm and inviting. We arrived early in the morning and we were allowed to check into our room a couple of hours prior to standard check-in time. Everyone spoke English excellently and everyone was very friendly. Our room was small but big enough for my husband  I plus it was very quiet. I did not hear anything from outside our room so sleeping well was not an issue. We had the best breakfasts at the hotel though we tired a couple other places. I wouldrecommend this hotel to others. It certainly helped make our visit to Paris more pleasurable.

<Content>Great Position This boutique hotel is in the perfect place to explore Paris. I could see the Arc de Triumphe from my little balcony.Breakfast served by the wait staff was rather better than the usual buffet. (Nice outside area for warmer days)Room was well set up with a spacious bathroom. (Almost an oriental minimalist ambiance)Most of the reception/concierge were very helpful.My only negative was smoking in the cafe/bar. One evening I went back with friends to the bar only to find this frenchman puffing away on a Gaulois!

<Content>Well-run and reliable little place We had no expectations of this hotel before arriving, as we had originally planned to stay at the KK Hotel Cayre in the 6th. Unfortunately, the KK's air conditioning was not working well, and it was 90 degrees the day we arrived. So we ended up moving to the Radisson, and the staff was very friendly and understanding of our situation. They didn't try to gouge us just because they sensed how desperate we were to find other accommodations. They set us up in a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc--granted, we could only see the top of the tower, and the arc was visible only if we stuck our heads out our window and looked to the right. But it was still pretty nice.The room--relatively small, but not uncomfortably so, and certainly not unusually small by Paris standards. Also, there was a nice-sized hallway in the room that made it feel more spacious, and a huge full-sized mirror. And we had a terrace with typical large French windows. Yes, the terrace was small and really only big enough to stand in, but the mere fact that it was there made the room feel bigger. The room was always spotless, and turndown service was consistent and on time. The air conditioning was wonderful and individually controlled. TV worked fine, good amount of closet space, and lots of shelves to store your belongings. The bathroom--very cute, and very clean, except for one or two tiny patches of mildew in the shower tile. Otherwise, I only had two minor complaints about the bathroom. First, the sink drain was very, very slow. The sink was also very shallow and did not have a run-off drain, so, basically, in order to avoid overflow, you had to keep the water going at only a trickle. If you let it flow full blast, you basically ended up with a full sink within seconds. Second, the shower door was only about a foot wide, and leaked like crazy. We put three towels down on the floor to absorb the water, but after every shower, the towels and the floor were soaking wet. I mentioned these issues to the front desk. They were very smiling and understood the problems, but said that was just the way the bathrooms were designed. Slightly annoying, but not a huge deal.The service--I found the front desk staff very friendly and eager to please. They did not seem super-knowledgeable about restaurant recommendations and the like, so I wouldn't rely on them for that kind of information. What they are helpful with are calling places for you, lending umbrellas, etc. They always said good morning and good night with a smile, which was nice. The location--super-touristy and super-expensive, with a sprinkling of office buildings and car dealerships. (Mind you, these are Parisian office buildings and car dealerships, which are not ugly eye sores at all; it just means the neighborhood can be pretty dead in spots, especially during the summer.) The outdoor cafes on the Champs Elysees, which are right around the corner from the hotel, are overpriced and mediocre. That said, the hotel is in easy walking distance of just about everything in central Paris. The nearest taxi stand is 2 blocks away, and you can get just about anywhere in 10 minutes. Even Sacre Coeur is only a 15-minute cab ride away. Another convenience: there is an amazing drugstore/gift shop around the corner called Publicis Drugstore. It's pricey, but is great for supplies like bottled water, batteries, toiletries, newspapers, etc., as well as fun non-essentials like purses, cashmere sweaters, and just about anything else you can think of. Overall, the area felt very safe.I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to friends. It's not particularly charming or special or glamorous, but it's clean, spotless, friendly, and reasonably priced.

<Content>Great Location and good hotel! My husband and I have recently returned from a long weekend at this hotel and were really pleased that we chose to go here. The hotel is conveniently located, just a couple of minutes walk from the Charles de Gaule Etoile Metro station and right next to the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees.We decided to go for the 'Room with a View' package and got a good view of the Arc de Triomphe from our bedroom. The bedroom was larger than I expected it to be with a comfortable bed, plasma TV, mini bar, bathroom with bath and separate shower cubicle and very clean and tidy throughout. We also got a complimentary bottle of Champagne. It wasn't in the room on arrival but without prompting they brought it up to our room later that day and it was there for us to enjoy when we got back from our afternoon sight seeing. The Reception staff and bar staff were all friendly, helpful and cheerful. We had a full English breakfast included in our package. Unlike other hotels there is not a buffet but waiter service which will bring your choice to the table. Personally I preferred this as it was a more relaxing experience than battling for food with a crowd of people. There was plenty to eat. Choice of juice, choice of tea, coffee or hot chocolate (incidentally hot chocolate is to die for so give it a try!), big basket of pastries with jams. The cooked breakfast has sausage, egg any style, bacon, mushrooms and tomato and is cooked to order so hot and fresh. By the time you are finished you will be more than full enough to see through to lunchtime!The hotel itself is quite small so there are not any more amenities than necessary, so if you are looking for an all singing, all dancing type establishment then this isn't for you. However, if you like relaxed and peaceful surroundings with a boutique feel that is close to the Metro and has excellent accessability for all parts of Paris then this is a very good choice and you will enjoy your stay.

The courtyard with free wireless is amazing, a true escape from the city. Great breakfast, and the rooms are just fine. They're not the biggest, but they are clean and have nice views.I highly recommend this for business or pleasure in Paris!

<Content>Always good The location is great and the rooms are very nice. Most have standard American-style shower stalls, which is very nice if you don't like the French-hotel showers which don't have much of a partition from the bathroom. The rooms are quiet, even though it's in a busy part of town. The staff is always very helpful. Breakfast is a little pricey, but excellent- although the service at breakfast is inconsistent. If you need a snack, there is a market with a deli on the corner.

<Content>Great Location, Great Service, Great hotel I just came back from a three night stay at the Radisson SAS avenue Marceau and really enjoyed it. Not only the location is great, but also the quality of service, kindness of the staff and size of the bedroom.From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff couldn't be more helpful: restaurant advice, city tours etc....My friend had to call a doctor and the young man at the front desk was so efficient we waited less than 30 minutes for the doctor to arrive at the hotel. The day after, we received the kindest note from the General Manager to ask if my friend was better with a bottle of champagne. The evening of our arrival, as we didn't feel like going out, we had a lovely dinner on the terrace of the restaurant. The food is great and service just perfect.I will definitely book again at this hotel and recommend it to my friends.

<Author>2007reviewer
<Content>totally overrated I picked this hotel, as i do most of the hotels i stay at via tripadvisor. unfortunately, i was completely unimpressed and think this is a VERY mediocre hotel, and WAY overpriced. All of my other experiences with tripadvisor have been much closer to the mark.I booked directly through the radisson website and for the price of $370 euros per night for a five night stay was supposed to receive the following: (1) arc de triomphe view, (2) no smoking room, (3) king bed in a deluxe room, and (4) champagne on arrival.Here are my major complaints:1. This hotel is priced very highly, i believe based on the fact thatthey advertise and promise an arc de triomphe view and have beautifulpictures on their website where it looks like you can eat on your balcony with the arc gloriously in view. in my opinion, this is very deceptive advertising. In fact, the hotelfaces into an office building across the street--that is the view yousee when you are in the room. The only arc view is if you go on the balcony (which is no more than two feet wide and four feet long and doesn't even have room to sit), stand and turn your head to look down the street. The pictures on the website, where there is a large table and people are enjoying a meal with the arc hugely impressive in the background is from the one suite in the hotel (it is not what you see from the deluxe room i booked!!!)2. the deluxe room we were given is much smaller than the majority ofpictures on the website. There was one small chair in the corner and sitting in it my knees touched the bed. Some of the website photos show rooms that were almost twice as large as ours. Not sure if we just got the one bad room in the bunch or if the website photos aren't representative. Based on my experience with this hotel, i would guess it was the later.3. in addition the bed is very uncomfortable--it is a thin mattress on a slat frame--there is no box spring, etc. Of the 7 hotels in italy and france we spent time at during this trip, this was by far the worst bed.4. I won't nitpick about other things, because the three above prettymuch left me cold. in addition, though, we were given a smoking room and only noticed after having spent 30 minutes unpacking--despite thefact that our confirmed reservation was for a non-smoking room and wenever received our champagne. As i have now gone back and re-read some of the reviews, both of these seem to be common occurrences at this hotel.this hotel is in a good area, but you know what, there are hundreds of well located paris hotels. after my bad experience the first night, i started calling to switch hotels, and for the same price (ora price within 20 or so euros), i found rooms at some of paris' best hotels--the crillon and the intercontinental (now the westin)--although the rooms at these hotels didn't include breakfast--still, the choice was totally clear. We ended up at the westin in a room about three times the size of our room at the radisson.i raised all of these concerns with the management and i'm not reallysure they cared. i would never stay at this hotel again and would warn you to read all the reviews carefully, because i think the cumulative score on tripadvisor is very misleading for this particular hotel.

<Content>It could have been so good. My wife and I booked this hotel for our honeymoon. We paid a bit extra for a superior room with a view (and a free bottle of champagne). Like the rest of Paris, it was quite expensive. I couldn't seem to find any cheap deals on the web, so just booked through the Radisson website. We stayed there at the start of June 07.Upon arrival we were told that the water on our floor wasn't working. Consequently, we had to stay in another hotel for our first night. The only place on offer (apparently, as Paris was so busy!) was the Concorde La Fayette. This gets an average rating of just 2.5 on TripAdvisor. And it showed. Even though we were put in a Junior Suite, it was a large, run-down hotel in an inferior location (see the reviews for yourself). Needless to say, we were less than pleased. Especially as we were only there for 3 nights! When I finally spoke to the manager (of the Radisson), she offered us a free meal. But never once did they offer to upgrade us. In fact, when we finally got into our room, we had to ask a couple of times for our champagne.To be fair though, after this rather unfortunate incident, the hotel was generally fine. Excellent location, friendly and helpful staff, with a nicely designed interior (although I still thought our room had a bit of a damp smell to it).Overall, I do think that our problem was probably a one-off. So I would still recommend this hotel. And the food was also very good. I just wish we'd realised that the drinks were free too...Finally, contrary to popular belief, we found the people in Paris to be very friendly.

<Content>Good location. Nice hotel I hesitated to review this hotel as I was there on points, and sometimes it's not a fair assessment if you're not a paying customer. But I'll add my quick two cents. Location? Could NOT be much better. Of course, depending on what you're looking for. Near the fabulous designers, L'Arc de Triomphe was visible if I leaned out my window, Champs Elysees a 1 minute walk, restaurants, the Metro, a LOVELY store about a 30 second walk that had anything you could possibly need, an epicurean delight. This was my 4th trip to Paris, but each has been very different. This one was luxurious. If you're looking for more flavor/charm/character...the Champs Elysees might not be the area for you. Room was beautiful. Wooden floors and built ins, gorgeous bathroom. I had two rooms (traveling with teens) that connected and both were nice. I was booked in a standard room, but I don't know if they might have upgraded me or not. The rooms were quite large with TONS of closet space. They look like the hotel's website. BUT...on arrival we had no air conditioning. I called down and was told it was inadvertently not turned on from downstairs, and that they then did so. I struggled for the next 2 nights wondering why it was still sweltering, but felt uncomfortable asking again because they SAID they'd corrrected it. Fortunately, it was COLD outside, so the rooms never got so that we couldn't stand it, but it was close. There was no opening the window to cool the room beause they were fabulously soundproofing. But, if you opened them, there is an underground garage entrance just outside the hotel and the horrid loud noise of cars exiting/entering and going over a metal plate is constant. The last day, I finally asked again, they said they'd call me back. In 5 minutes the air started and they never did call me back. We could hardly sleep so this was the only REALLY disappointing part. We ate the full breakfast there both days, and it was reasonably priced compared to others. And it was VERY good. The service was polite at the small restaurant/bar...as well as the front desk. I got a tiny bit of attitude from the concierge when I asked if they could check when the Paris Opera (Garnier) held tours in English. My daughter is a huge fan and, though we speak a bit of French, knew we'd get a lot more out of the tour in English. But online searches gave conflicting information and it was THE reason we decided to stop in Paris again. Well, I've never done anything like that...but I guess I'll make the call. Of course I tipped him, and ... in typical American fashion overtipped. But he still must have felt it was something he shouldn't have to do.

<Content>Great stay in Paris Just returned from a seven night stay at the Radisson Paris. It was my wife's first time to Paris, although I have been several times and have stayed in properties ranging from very small boutique hotels to the Meurice. Overall, the Radisson delivered on the Parisian experience. The location is fantastic, located in the 8th district just off the Champs Elysees. Very good restaurants, cafes, and shopping are very close by, and the George V metro stop is less than 5 mins walk. Next door is a sort of drugstore that also sells books, pastries, sundries and drinks (incl spirits) which is very convenient. Breakfast (we had the continental each morning) was very good. The service was excellent, both at the concierge and in the restaurant. The staff speaks excellent English and are very helpful, although for food recommendations, we would recommend a Zagat or Michelin guide for the true foodie in Paris. Rooms were clean, decorated with a modern flair, and roomy (~200 sq feet) for Parisian standards. Bed and linens were very comfortable. In room bar and safe provided. Our room had a limited view of the street, although we have been told Eiffel Tower views are available.The only complaints we would have would be the overall cleanliness of the bathrooms. The bathrooms themselves are of a good size - however, the sink is of a unique shape, and like previous reviewers have commented, difficult to keep clean. Likewise, we felt the shower could have been somewhat cleaner. Otherwise, an overall excellent stay, with a very friendly and helpful staff. Value for money is debatable (we paid 350 euros ~ 500 USD) but this just seems to be Europe nowadays.

<Content>Just short of the mark We stayed here for 3 nights with the Romance package for our wedding anniversary. Check in was great and the staff at the front desk were courteous and efficient at all times. There were however just a few things which stopped this hotel from being as good as it could be. Simple things like providing luxury toiletries only on the first day left us feeling dissatisfied especially as the rate is the same for each day. Breakfast was disorganised and despite the numerous staff you needed to ask for everything which made it a bit of an ordeal rather than a pleasure. Housekeeping was really only focussed on making the bed and providing clean towels, the room itself was really not cleaned. We did enjoy our stay , the room and bathroom were excellent and the location was terrific but I wouldn't return to this hotel. This is our 3rd stay in Paris and the only time we have really felt just a bit let down by a hotel.

<Content>Excellent Hotel! I absolutely loved this hotel. The location couldn't have been better. The rooms were spacious..by European standards. What really impressed me was it's staff. They went out of their way to make this a really great stay. I can honestly say that I have not come across a staff so committed to their guests needs than the staff at this hotel and always with a warm smile.

<Content>Disappointed I am also torn on my feelings about the Radisson Clamps Elysees. The staff were very helpful and extremely cheerful and the hotel is in an excellent location and very well maintained. However, I was disappointed with certain aspects. Although I had requested a no smoking room I was given the key to a smoking room but when explained were moved without any problem to a no smoking room. I had booked a deluxe room but while the room was ok, albeit a bit small, I did not feel that it was 'deluxe'. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room but perhaps this is normal for Paris. The funky grey sink had limescale deposit in and did not appear to be very hygenic. We had paid for a package to include champagne on arrival (had to ask for it and did not arrive until late afternoon and was very poor quality). The package also included full English breakfast which I chose not to have and opted for the cheaper breakfast but was then told that I could not have the basket of croissants/bread buns as it was not included in the package?! I left the breakfast table hungry. Would I stay there again - no. I think the hotel is overpriced and we paid for the 'Radisson' name and location.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Booked the Radisson based on the good reviews posted on this website. We reserved a room with a view on the top floor and were not disappointed. It had a wonderful picture postcard view of the Arc de Triomphe. Room was a good size and we loved the contemporary furniture and the timber floors which are much cleaner and healthier than carpet. Definitely well worth the price. It is also in a great, safe location with easy access to restaurants, the Champ Elysee and the Metro. While Ave Marceau is reasonably busy, the rooms were extremely quiet as a result of the double glazed windows.Staff were always very helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great city hotel We stayed for four nights in this hotel. We had two rooms with a connecting door so that the two kids had their own room. The hotel is suberbly located next door to the Arc de Triomphe and a metro station. We can highly recommend this hotel. The hotel is 100% noise proof, has a stylish interior and friendly staff. The breakfest is very tasty. The rooms are rather small but even five star hotels like the Intercontinental have similar size rooms. The hotel has no restaurant. As you stay in the middle of Paris, this does not matter. Nevertheless, there is a room service if you really do not want try one of the numerous restaurants in the surrounding. The mattresses are excellent and the bath room is also clean and nice. Bottom line: We will go again and can recommend the place. Not cheap, but worth the price.

<Content>Service exceeded expectations Visited Paris for the first time at the beginning of April and was fortunate to have found the Radisson. Being my first visit and arriving by train from Monte Carlo, the hotel arranged a driver for pick up at the station and was similarly helpful throughout the stay - nothing was beyond their effort. We quickly felt at home and was impressed that the restaurant staff remebered our breakfast orders. The Radisson has managed to create an atmosphere were the guest feels welcome and everyone truly seems to enjoy working there. The concierge was one of the best I have experienced and we already are planning our return trip next year and definately will be at the Radisson.

<Content>Amazing hotel! I spent last week-end at the Radisson SAS Champs Elysees and I don鈥檛 have enough words to say how amazing my stay was!As soon as we arrived at the hotel, the staff was nice, efficient and very patient with my terrible French!Our room was very large and comfortable (much bigger than the other rooms I have experienced in Paris), wood on the floor, nice decoration trendy and contemporary and TV plasma screen as well as free wi-fi internet access.The bathroom was also very nice with separate shower and bathtub.Breakfast is served at the restaurant, a very charming and cosy area with a terrace: a real garden only a few meters from the Champs Elysees!!We experienced the restaurant the evening of our arrival, wow! It was amazing: original, tasty and delicate.Again, the staff was very kind and didn't make a lot of fuss.As the restaurant is also opened to the public, we really experienced a very 鈥淧arisian ambiance鈥?This hotel is really one of the best I have been to in Paris, its location is just perfect (a few meters from the metro station 鈥淐harles de Gaulle鈥? on the main metro line) I will definitely recommend it to my friends and come back there next time I鈥檒l be in Paris!

<Content>Great Location Having looked at the last review it appears that not all the room facilities are the same we didnt have a coffee machine and we didnt get nice cakes! Also our room stunk of cigrarettes we did ask for theroom to be sprayed and we even tried to change rooms however being easter the rooms were full!Now aside the negatives the location is great and I believe thats what you truly pay for. The service in the hotel apart from not getting cakes! is good and we got everything we asked for. So cant fault them there.The car park is crazy and they were not helpful. i will also say that Paris is vvvv expensive and prices for everything have massivelyinflated on average we were paying 6- 8 euros for a bottle of beer bit steep when we half that at home. However I love the place and wwould reccomend a visit to Budha bar not cheap but great place

<Content>Lovely - GREAT service! Booked this hotel for a conference meeting. However the room suggested for the meeting was far too small. They solved this problem very quickly and provided an alternative (just across the street) which was more than adequate. The hotel is compact but very comfortable and stylish. Overall the stay was great, lovely hotel and excellent service all round. The staff couldn't do enough to help and the Concierge was fanstastic!

<Content>Location Location Location We booked 3 rooms from 12-13 Jan. The first thing to say is the location is perfect. the hotel is not a typically large Radisson hotel but more boutique with only about 8 rooms on each floor (certainly on the 2nd floor anyway). We were very lucky to have 2 of our rooms (203, 204) to have balconies with views of the Arc de Triomphe (as seen on the website). Room 205 was facing away from the road with no real view at all. All the rooms were slightly different though all decorated with the same high quality finish. One of the rooms (203) had a stand alone shower and a bath while the other two had a shower in the bath. All the rooms had double beds rather than twins.The trade off with the rooms with the view is that the traffic noise is also greater than rooms on the other side of the corridor. This is not really that much of an issue if the doors are firmly shut, but the rooms were so hot even when the aircon was set to 17 degrees and on max output that we had to leave the balcony doors slightly ajar to cool the room down.Staff were very helpful, and even rustled up an impromptu birthday cake when they overheard us saying that it was my Mums birthday which was a relly nice touch.Breakfast was good (and table service rather than buffet) though quite expensive at 鈧?6 per person (especially when your kids hardly eat anything !) There is the opportunity to just choose a continental or cooked breakfast, but the staff seemesd intent on bringing everything to eat and charging the full 鈧?26.All in all, a very nice hotel, and one that I would definitely stay at again.

<Content>Fantastic room and super friendly staff This was my second trip to Paris within a year.Back in May I stayed at the Prince de Galles on George V in the 8th. Being I love the area, but couldn't afford the Prince for a full week I tried my luck at the Radisson SAS Champs Elysees, and soooo glad I did!It feels more like a boutique hotel, the thing I loved most about it was that the room had hard wood floors, so no icky odor! Bed was extremely comfortable and clean. The bath was to die for! Full tub, separate shower and fantastic modern sink.Of course, in European fashion, the room was small, but big deal, face it folks, MOST of the rooms outside the U.S. are smaller than we're used to (except Manhattan, where I live).The staff was so incredibly friendly.I ate at the restaurant one night, it was ok, I'm more of a brasserie girl when I'm in Paris, but the staff was so sweet I just wanted to hang with them one night in the hotel. Had a glass of wine every night in the lobby library bar. And I must say, the croque monsier there was one of the best I've ever had in my life!I will absolutely stay there again, without any hesitation. The price is (dare I say) cheap considering what you're getting. And yes, so close to everything....

<Content>Great hotel, central location The Radisson SAS on Avenue Marceau, Champs-Elysees was great. An excellent location - walking out of the door to see the Arc de Triomph right there. The rooms were lovely - loads of storage and a gorgeous bathroom with separate shower and bath. The bedroom was clean, trendy - everything you would need. The service was excellent - the concierge was particularly - booked us restaurants, gave us maps with directions for restaurants. I would definately recommend this hotel and would visit again.

<Content>Top hotel for Paris Just came back from a weekend from Paris. Radisson SAS hotel is second to none if you're looking for a hotel near Champs. It is strategically located just off Champs Elysees so you don't get all the noise and crowd, yet it's less than a minute walk from the main street.The hotel is recently renevated so everything feels/smells fresh. It's a very cosy hotel with 50 or so rooms. Staff are very helpful and will do everything they can to make your stay pleasent. Recommended to parents coming with children.Because of the size of the hotel, you really feel that the staff are taking care of you. This is rated as a 3 star hotel in Tripadvisor but would give it a 4 star without hesitation.

<Content>Highly Recommended Terrific hotel. Would go back again. High marks for each of the following:Location:Extremely convenient. A few blocks from the main Metro line that goes directly to the Louvre and other major attractions and provides transfers to all other lines. A block from the Champs-Elysees, which has numerous shopping and eating options at all price levels. Drug/foodstore at the corner is open until 2am. Close to ritzy shopping if that's important. Very pleasant 10-15 walk to the river and the Bateaux Mouche.Room:As with most European rooms, a bit on the small side. But room is clean and modern, a bit like a W hotel. Bed was comfortable and a true king, not two singles put together. We were on a non-smoking floor and did not have any issues with smelling smoke. Bathroom was good-sized, plenty of room. No shower curtain/door, so just need to be careful about spraying water. Small refrigerator where we stored water, milk, juice, fruits. No issue with noise, though we did face the inside courtyard.Service and Amenities:Concierge/front desk was uniformly pleasant and helpful with providing directions, suggestions and reservations for dinner (definitely try Chez Henri for the French brasserie experience, excellent food and gracious service). There is one computer in the lobby/lounge area with free internet access. Did not try to food. Preferred to grab food from a pastry shop or to buy some cereal/fruits at a nearby grocery and eat in our room.Conclusion: Would highly recommend to anyone. Comparable to high quality hotels here in the US. Westin/W in particular comes to mind.

<Content>Loved The Radisson SAS Champs Elysees - Great Hotel!!! WONDERFUL HOTEL! Our family of ten spent two nights at this Radisson Hotel in Paris in June 2006 and it lived up to the good reviews by others. We had one family with 4 members (2 children) with only one bed in the room. Hotel staff went above and beyond the call of duty to fit a rollaway into the room which was small, but large by Paris standards. We have stayed at other Paris hotels which were a lot more expensive, but not as nice as this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful in every way. In fact, I left a sandal in the room and contacted the hotel after returning home. I emailed them about two weeks later and they searched diligently and finally found it. They actually called me to make arrangements to mail the sandal back to me.The rooms were very nice and modern, looking like they had been recently updated. They also were air conditioned which was a necessity the weekend we were in Paris as it was extremely hot. The location was perfect for walking to all of the sites or catching the underground. I would make this hotel my hotel of choice for my next trip to Paris.

<Content>Great hotel - great location - a bit pricey Radisson SAS Hotel Champs Elysees is a great hotel! If it is your first visit to Paris, the Champs Elysees is a wonderful location! The hotel is clean, the staff is very friendly and the decor is very modern and minimalist - which is very nice since the rooms are so small! I don't mind small rooms since most of our time was spent out and about, however I think it's a little pricey. The room itself was a pretty good value because of the location and hight quality of the hotel, but everything else adds up (I had a hot chocolate at the bar that was $10)!The Radisson SAS Hotel Champs Elysees is a first class hotel. It's 1 block from the Arc and very close to the metro station. Since I'm now more familiar with the city, I will most likely stay a little further from Champs Elysees and get a little more room for my money. But like I said, it's a good, boutique hotel for your first visit to Paris, or if you like staying in the heart of the tourist area! It's very nice!

<Content>Great value for Paris We have stayed at many of the hotels in Paris as business has us there often from the US. This was our first time at the Radisson, and we will certainly use them again. The rooms were ample size, clean and well appointed. The staff was very helpful and polite.Bathroom was spotless. The only negative I would give would be on the quality of the bed, a bit of a let down and definatly not a place to cut corners. But for the money I can deal with it...

<Content>Attentive  My husband and I stayed in the SAS Radisson on the Avenue Marceau for 4 nights in early May for our 5th wedding anniversary. Overall this is an excellent boutique hotel, it has a wonderful location very close to the Champs Elysees and Metro which makes it very easy to get around. The room was comfortable with a large bathroom and had a turn down service every night. The staff were attentive, polite and very pleasant at all times, we would return to this hotel without hesitation.We made great use of the publicis shop on the corner of the Champs Elysees and their croissants were amasing, much better than paying a fortune for breakfast if it is not included in your package. There is also a restaurant in the publicis complex which was very good for dinner and we had ice-cream sundaes in there on our last afternoon which were very nice indeed!We can heartedly recommend trying a Segway tour of paris[-----] our guide PJ was excellent, very knowledgeable and fun unlike some stuffy guides who take themselves too seriously. It's a superb way to see paris without the strain of aching legs or having your nose constantly in a guide book!We also tried the bateux mouche and although it was quite good, we sat at the back of the boat which was very smelly with diesel fumes and i would advise that no matter the weather, you should take a cardigan or jacket as it can get pretty cold.Another restaurant worth a try is rotisserie d'en face and le pre was excellent for lunch, both are in the 6th arr.Finally, if you're there over a weekend you must try the flea market near the porte de cligancourt metro station, it was huge!!

<Content>Ravishing Radisson My partner and I stayed in the SAS Radisson on the Avenue Marceau for 4 nights in early May. Overall this is an excellent boutique hotel, it has a wonderful location very close to the Champs Elysees and Metro which makes it very easy to get around. We paid a little extra, Eur 340 per night in order to secure a room with a view of the Arc De Triomphe and it was well worth the extra expense. The room was comfortable with a large bathroom and the rate included a full English Breakfast each morning for two. The staff were helpful and very pleasant at all times, all in all a thumbs up for the Radisson, which contributed to a magical stay in Paris, we would return to this hotel without hesitation and we are already looking forward to doing so.

<Content>Sorry... I was disappointed! My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel over Easter on a weekend getaway to Paris. As a romantic I paid the extra to get a room with a guaranteed view of Arc de Triomphe and a bottle of champagne on arrival.I鈥檓 torn on this hotel. The employees are lovely, helpful, friendly and forgiving of Englishmen that don鈥檛 speak French.On Easter Sunday they even delivered an Easter Egg. A lovely touch.The rooms look nice too. They are funky modern affairs鈥?br/>I said I was torn鈥?The downsides are鈥?br/>The room was small, we stayed in 203, there is just enough room for the furniture and not enough room for the furniture if you want to open the French doors leading to the balcony with that view of the Arc de Triomphe. Don鈥檛 get too excited, the balcony is less than a metre wide and the only way you see the Arc is by stepping out onto it. Then again you could just step outside the hotel and get a better view鈥?br/>The champagne (actually鈥?methode champenoise) was not exactly quality either.The funky bathroom has a door frame that is coming away from the wall, not major, but a nice dirt trap that should be fixed. The shower has a waterproof (I hope鈥? light directly above the shower head. I say I hope it is waterproof because the shower head needs replacing a water shoots at force into the light and the ceiling! The basin is funky, not practical though and the limescale deposit that has been allowed to build up is a little unforgivable.Finally the in-room safe was not, on account of how it did not work. When I pointed this out I was told it would be fixed, it was not鈥?nor where we offered an alternate room, then this was one of the better rooms鈥?br/>In all my reviews I say, the bottom line is this, would I stay there again? The answer is simple鈥?No. I suspect there are far better hotels in Paris than this one. And don鈥檛 expect that famous Radisson promise to get you out of jail either. I was not satisfied and I still had to pay full rate.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel, Fabulous Location.. We went here for our honeymoon and it was wonderful! The rooms were lovely and the bathrooms were fab! Whever we went out - no matter how long for - the beds were always made when we came back. The mini bar was well stocked and it had a flat screen TV in the room. The air conditioning was lovely also! We didn't eat there but due to its amazing location, there is plenty of places for you to go. It is a few steps to the Arc de triomph and the Champs Elysees, which is brillaint as the shops on the Champs Elysees don't seem to ever close!! When we got there the very helpful concierge booked us in to the most AMAZING restaurant I have ever been to called 'Le Chiberta' which is a few minutes away. If your staying here you MUST go to it!!! It was about 140 euros for two people two courses but worth every penny.We got a good deal through expedia.co.uk as it is very expensive there. Then again everything in Paris is ridiculously expensive - and i thought London was expensive!You can jump on the double decker bus from the Arc de Triomph which takes you around all the major sites - a great way to see Paris. The only one thing i would say is that i arranged through the hotel to have a Limo to pick us up from the Gare du Nord. It certainly WASN'T a limo and it cost 125 euros!!! The most expensive taxi ride EVER!!!!! There are millions of taxis waiting outside the station when you arrive and it is easy as pie to flag one down on the Champs Elysees when your leaving. This taxi ride cost about 15 euros.All in all a wonderful hotel - it really made our trip to Paris.

<Content>Birthday bliss in Paris We booked a room with a view package for 280 euro to celebrate my husband's birthday. The room was absolutely gorgeous, with champagne and a view of the Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower. Although we arrived well into the evening and had booked for dinner, the champagne and a bath in the divine bathroom seduced us first! Our request for a later table was happily accommodated. The staff at this hotel are amazing - all those we met were French and tolerated my attempts to practice their language, but spoke impeccable English when necessary. They were all friendly and helpful. Our dinner was lovely but although I'd told them in advance I'm a vegetarian, I was given the almost inevitable omelette! This was disappointing. I know the hotel's in Paris, but a quiche or something similar shouldn't have presented a challenge to a good chef! Our breakfast, included in the room price, made up for it.We thought the package was fantastic value and can't wait to go back for a longer stay.

<Content>100% Perfect! My mother and I stayed at this hotel in mid-August 2005 for four nights (I'm a little delayed in writing my review). The location is absolutely wonderful. When we traveled to Paris in the past we received somewhat of a frosty reception from our hotel, but the staff at the Radisson went above and beyond being friendly. They booked our train reservation to London for us, finding an incredible deal, gave us suggestions for many delicious restaurants on the Champs to try, and the concierge even had a drink with us one evening (after work of course). :)The room was very posh and modern, with flat screen tvs and gorgeous furniture. Although it's a little smaller than traditional American hotel rooms, it never felt tiny. There's only about eight rooms per floor, which makes it feel even more quaint. The location of the hotel is fantastic - the Champs is one street over. My mother and I never felt nervous walking home at night, even after a few glasses of wine on the Champs. Overall, this is a fantastic hotel that I would gladly return to.

<Content>Amazing staff  We've just returned from 1 week spent into Paris.Nothing began well, as all our luggages have been lost by our carrier and it was for me so important to get them because they did contain my medicine treatment.So I get very seriously stressed until we arrived into this heaven of peace. As soon we get there, everything was under controlled, Thomas and Renald were more than gentle and helpful, they have taken all our needs into consideration, taking notes about the details from our flights, etc.... They were so amazing!We spent with our little family very happy holidays, everything was great as I can get my medicine delivered daily, our luggages were finally delivered in New York but for us the more important was the extremely high standard of service reached by this hotel. Thank you guys, we do love you, and will come back soon.

<Content>Absolutely Perfect My husband and I have just returned from a wonderful 3 night break at the Radisson SAS Hotel. All I can say is that our stay was perfect in every way, the hotel staff were extremely courteous and helpful, our hotel room was on the 7th floor with wonderful views of both the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower, the hotel was extremely clean - rooms even cleaned twice daily!Paris was absolutely beautiful and the people could not have been more friendly.We travelled to Paris on Eurostar from Waterloo which was also extremely good and I would recommend upgrading to Leisure Select.I would travel via Eurostar again and when we return to Paris I would definately stay at this hotel again!

<Content>Nice - Unless you want to eat here This was a nice hotel - but not worth the money. My partner and I stayed here for a weekend at the end of August 2005. The hotel itself is well maintained and has a good location. The major downside to this hotel is that if your stay includes a Saturday or Sunday, the kitchen is closed and you can not eat here. This is not what I expect from a hotel of this class. Overall, Paris is a lovely city, but I would not chose this hotel again. Very disappointing.

<Content>Watch out Watch out. The hotel is very nice and despite being on a busy road has good sound insulation. However you really do run the risk of being bumped. Just like another reviewer on this site I booked a two night stay over a month in advance abd was told, on arrival, that there were no room for me at the inn (a similar excuse of clients being ill etc). They put us in the napoleon for one night. The napoleon was ok but not up the Radisson's standards. Anyway our w/e was very much inconvenienced and I insisted on a discount, which I got and made up for it, at least to some extent - but I would have preferred to pay full rate and stay at the radisson.A tip. Radisson have a policy - if you dont like what they give you and they dont correct it - you dont pay. I didn't insist on it (I did get a discount) but am sure that I could have.Would I go again? - yes - but in future I will be calling in advance to make sure they dont mess me about.

<Content>Great Place to Stay We stayed at the Radisson Champs Elisses for 4 nights to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We loved everything about this hotel!! The staff was awesome. They all speak English and they went out of their way to help us with directions, tours, reservations, etc. Without even asking, we got upgraded to a room with a balcony, which overlooked the Arc de Triumph.- The room was very clean and spacious by European standards. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, which has excellent food, but it was expensive.- The location couldn't be better. It's 1/2 block walk to the Arc of Triumph, 1 block away from the Champs Elysees, where you find bistros, boutiques, restaurants and the famous Lido. It's also just 1 block to the Charles De Gaulle Metro. We took the metro everywhere. Also, the Hop on Hop off double-decker bus (great way to see Paris), stops at Charles de Gaulle. - This hotel is a great alternative to the Marriott, which is more expensive and it's just 4 blocks away.Overall we give the Radisson two thumbs up!!

<Content>Great Base for Paris Just returned from an 8-night stay at the Radison SAS Champs. We found this to be a great base of operations for a long stay in Paris. Convenient to George V station on the 1-line to reach Louvre, Notre-Dame, etc. On Ave. Marceau off the etoile at the Arc, about 1km to Tour Eiffel. Very quiet room, with no street noise, or noise from other rooms. Very effective AC, very comfortable with large beds. Bathrooms were large and modern, and the property was very, very clean. Nice bar and courtyard ideal for relaxing after a day of touring. Bar and restaurant seemed a little high, so we ate mostly on the Champs, or in several of the cafes along Ave. Marceau. We arrived tired and early, but the staff got us in our room by noon and were very helpful. Concierege services were good and the staff were friendly and respectful of privacy, but were also available and effective. Booked for a rate of 275Euros (about $330) and found this to be consistent with a hotel of comparable price in any large city in the states. I would recommend this hotel for couples or business purposes and found it to be a modern, clean, convenient base in the center of Paris.

<Content>Very enjoyable stay Very good stay for a reasonable rate (202 Euro per night). Didn't try the breakfast (seemed rather expensive), but there are so many cafes in Paris this wasn't a problem. Slightly out of the centre location, but most of the tourist sites easily reached by the nearby Metro. Excellent soundproofing in the room and very effective air conditionning. Car park very useful and friendly staff. Recommended.

<Content>Not a 5-Star Hotel, but pretty good I think this hotel claims to be a five-star hotel; but a 5 minute walk to the Four Seasons George V hotel will show anyone what true undiluted 5-star luxury is. Having said that we received good friendly service from almost all the staff. The rooms were clean and furnished in the contemporary style. The location is very good indeed: just a stones throw from Champs Elysees and Arc de Triomphe. A few relatively minor negatives: the room was quite small and difficult to move around (but then again this is paris); the toiletries in the bathroom were not up to standard; and breakfast was overpriced, short on quantity and designed mainly for the businessman in a hurry, not the relaxing tourist. They charged us 315 Euros per night (excluding breakfast) which I felt in view of the size of the rooms (on the 2nd floor) and their amenities was not great value; but the location and modern feel of the hotel almost made up for that.

<Content>No Room Even You Paid weeks Ago! A room booked and being confirmed online at the rate of EURO252 on 15 August 2005 with Hotel Champs Elysees. When I arrived at the hotel, the manager claimed the hotel was full due to some unexpected circumstances (somebody was sick blah blah blah ...) and she offered to transfer us to the Hotel du Louve which is on the very opposite side of the city and in terms of its condiditons, it looks worn-out. My partner and I would love to stay in a boutique hotel so we didn't accept the offer and was offered to another SAS hotel in Boulogne which is far from the city and we checked in at 9pm eventually. The manager seems learn little about our story and he said he used to work in the Champs Elysees one - he suggested there might be an overbooking there. I discovered the online room rate of this SAS is EURO175, different from what I paid EURO252 online for the Champs Elysees one so I asked if there is a refund. The manager at Boulgne said this has nothing to do with his hotel - it's something between me and the SAS Champs Elysees. All he could do was to offer us two breakfast - but we didn't comsume the next morning. The SAS Champs Elysees didn't even offer to pay for my taxi fare to Boulgne, not to mention all those phone calls made through my roaming phone card. My partner and I stayed in Paris for only two days but the hotel thing spent 50% time of our trip. We checked in at 9pm and checked out the next day at 11am. The entire trip has been spolied for the re-location within Paris. I wonder why the hotel doesn't honour a booking of 3 weeks in advance. There is a cancellation charge applying onto the client, but it doens't seem to appy onto the hotel itself, I wonder. Also, if they put me in a hotel of different location and rate, why they didn't offer an refund of the difference, plus all compensation of commuting cost and time lost?

It is honestly a perfect hotel!

<Content>Nice and Modern Found a bargain through SAS website. Stayed here for two nights. The room is new and clean, and is above average in size for European standards. In the center of Paris at 200 Euro per night you cannot complain much (especially the staff so nice and friendly), but wi-fi connection was not available inside our room so had to go downstairs to get connected. Everything else was wonderful and would stay here again for sure.

<Content>No room available, despite confirmation My boyfriend and I were to stay at the Radisson for 2 nights this past week, however were unable to get to Paris on Thursday due to the bombings in London. We called to let them know that we would not make it out of London on Thursday due to the circumstances, but told them that we definitely wanted our room for Friday night  they confirmed the reservation. Upon arriving on Friday we were told that they had overbooked the hotel  that they had booked us in a different hotel several blocks away. As I had booked this reservation 3 months prior and confirmed the day before, I didn't understand why this had happened. To top it off, they simply handed us a map  circled where the other hotel was located  were expecting to just send us on our way. We asked to speak with the manager, who apologized and ended up offering us a bottle of champagne and help with our luggage to the other hotel. Nice, but ... I specifically booked this hotel based on reviews given on this website. Why bother to research and book a hotel if you can't count on staying there? The hotel is certainly in a great location and all in all it turned out ok, but I certainly would not book here if you are set on staying in this specific hotel as it appears this is a common problem...(based on prior reviews)...

<Content>Wonderful!!! Just had a good 5 nights stay at this hotel. Have been to Paris many times over the past two years, clearly this is a wonderful 4 star hotels. The room is nice, clean, and very quiet even we stayed on the 2nd floor. The best is its baht room, especially comparing to those of the 4 star hotels around Opera area.

<Content>Great Hotel My husband and I stayed there for four nights during the first week of May. All of the staff (with the exception of one particular desk clerk) were extremely pleasant and helpful. The room we were assigned to originally, was on the fifth floor (505) and was an odd shape. The passage from the entrance door to the bedroom was very narrow. Our luggage wouldn't have fit through without us moving some of the furniture. We called down to the desk and a woman told us we could have a room on the second floor. When we met her on the second floor, she said a room was available on the first floor instead. The room (107) was a more traditional shape and our luggage fit just fine. We were told that the 07 rooms are the largest ones in the hotel. After we unpacked, my husband went to take a shower before dinner. (There is a tub in the bathroom as well as a shower stall, but as in most European hotels, they do not use shower curtains around the tubs, so if you're not used to it, you end up getting water all over the bathroom!) The water did not work in the shower. When I called the desk, another clerk (not the one who moved us) told me that it was the only room in the hotel where the shower didn't work! Why the clerk who moved us didn't tell us that, we'll never know! So, no showers that night. We had to pack up the next morning and move. Arnaud was very quick and helpful with the move to 507. All that said, we thoroughly enjoyed the rest of our stay. The hotel rooms are very modern (a little bit larger than most European rooms I've stayed it), clean and quiet. The location is excellent as well. Arnaud is excellent at his job as head concierge! I e-mailed him before our trip to make restaurant reservations and to arrange a cab pick-up from the train station and a cab ride to the airport upon our departure. Everything he arranged for us was perfect!As others have said, the restaurant is very expensive at the hotel. Go to the Publicis Drugstore for breakfast instead. Their restaurant is much more reasonable and the food is very good. They also sell alcohol there too, among many other things. We did enjoy dinner at the hotel once, but again, the prices were very steep.When I return to Paris, I will definitely stay there again!

<Content>Fabulous! We stayed here for six nights towards the end of April. The location is excellent. If you exit the hotel and turn right and then right again (and either pass through the Publicis drugstore or walk down the side of it), you're on the Champs Elysee - and right beside the Arc de Triomphe within a minute! A very impressive location.Unfortunately, the hotel seemed to be undergoing major upgrading works for the duration of our stay. Our room on the first floor was in the thick of it and it got worse and worse (a double bed lying in the corridor for two days and a very strong stench of something which smelled like superglue which eventually made its way into our room from the corridor). We paid a lot of money for our stay here (relatively speaking) and we were very disappointed to be living in a building site. We complained and the staff were very helpful and explained that they had to do the upgrading works now before the peak season (June). They explained that the management had taken the decision to keep the hotel open during the renovation works and that they were sorry for the inconvenience and would report our comments to the management. From what I could gather, other residents were affected too and some were turned away and relocated to another hotel because their room was not available! We were moved to another room on the seventh floor, which was much better as there was no refurb taking place.... until our second last day when five French men decided to remove the ceiling in the main corridor! We think they were installing air con in the landings on each floor, which makes sense as the remainder of the hotel has air con and the landings are very warm indeed.Aside from all of this (I guess it was just bad-timing on our/their part), the hotel is fabulous. The bedrooms are incredibly modern and they seem brand new, with plasma tv screens and white linen on the beds. I have no idea why the rooms need renovated, but perhaps they are meticulously up-dated each year to ensure that a high/modern standard is retained. The fittings are dark brown/steel/stone and lovely. The bathroom sink looks very funky, although it's a bit impractical as there is no sink plug and nor can you fill the sink! The shower and bath were great.The cleaning staff are excellent and the rooms are always spotless.... why does the toilet roll require a neat triangle at the end (during the morning clean AND the evening bed turn down)?! Breakfast was excellent, although not included in our deal. We were disappointed about this; we booked through Expedia and the implication was that breakfast was included. We know there were other guests staying at the hotel who were paying less than us and they had some sort of inclusive deal. Shop around before you book.The staff were excellent and courteous.The communal areas are beautiful and modern, with lovely cream suede chairs etc in the bar area. The bar prices are awful, though - far too expensive (about 14 euros for a gin and tonic!) and the mini bar is prohibitive (8.5 euros for a diet coke..... you can buy a diet coke for 1 euro in the Publicis drugstore - try that instead).I'd recommend this hotel to anyone. We'd stay there again. A fabulous location and very clean, luxurious and modern. A delight. Just don't visit in April when they're renovating... !

<Content>Nice Hotel  We have just returned from 4 nights at the Radisson Champs Elysee. The hotel is well situated for many attractions and is within 1 block of the champs Elysee and the Arc de Triomphe. The hotel is very clean and modern and the staff there were so helpful and friendly, they could not do enough for you. We had a room on the 6th floor and had a view of the Arc de Trtiomphe  the Eiffel Tower from our balcony. The room was very nice, clean  modern,although a little on the small side, but worth it for the view we had. The hotel staff will be happy to arrange everything from tours to restaurant reservations for you. One tip, take time out to have a meal at the hotel as the food and service was excellent. The only draw back with the hotel  I am being very picky now, was that it was slightly noisy with the road outside, but some ear plugs sorted that little problem out and we slept very well. Good shop  restaurant on the corner and a good french cafe across the road that is popular with the locals.

<Content>We have a problem Without doubt this is a nice hotel, if you actually get in to it! We arrived for my 40th birthday to be greeted with 鈥渨e have a problem鈥? In this case it meant they didn鈥檛 actually have a room for us for all three nights booked. So rather than settling in and getting on with our holiday we were bumped off to the nearby Best Western Regencia for our first night. The chap at reception there was very nice, and although the bathroom wasn鈥檛 up to the Radisson鈥檚 standard the room was very comfortable. No real complaint about that but not getting in to the hotel we booked and having to move on my birthday was very annoying.Despite this, our weekend in Paris was very enjoyable. I agree with the previous review that the Publicis Drugstore on the corner has everything you could possibly need. The Seine dinner cruise on the Bateaux Parisiens is a very pleasant way to spend an evening and if you want to avoid the worst of the queues for the Louvre, try entering via the subway or better still the Lion鈥檚 Gate entrance (no queue at all).

<Content>Merci My wife and I vacationed in Paris Christmas week through New Year's Day. As this was our first trip to Paris we were a bit anxious about what to expect from our accommodations as well as the people. We've travelled in Europe and learned that four/five star U.S. and the same rating oversees don't always match up. Let me assure you that both the hotel and the people were fantastic. Even before arriving in Paris I worked with our concierge, Arnaud, to plan restaurant and tour reservations. I found Arnaud and his team to be very knowledgeable and flexible in meeting our needs. For example, my wife and I walked the city all day and came to our hotel at about 10 pm hungry and tired. The staff ordered us a pizza, set it up in the lounge with china and candelight and the meal cost us only $13 euros. The hotel was beautiful. It reminded me very much of the W Union Square in NYC. It's well designed, classy and a bit cutting-edge (club music is played in the lobby). Our room had high ceilings, a beautiful bay window, hardwood floors, contemporary furnishings and a large bathroom with a great shower and good water pressure. The people we met in the lobby lounge (both staff and other guests) were very friendly and helpful in giving us tips on where to go and what to do. Even minor inconveniences were handled well by the staff. On our last day the hotel had a serious plumbing issue which meant we had to shower in cold water. To make up for this inconvenience the staff simply reduced our rate for the day. When we return to Paris we'll return to the Radisson. Merci!
