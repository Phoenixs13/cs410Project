<Content>Perfect Stay I stayed with a friend for four nights in the Heckers hotel. The location is excellent, the area is enjoyable to explore with its many shops, galleries and restaurants. It is also convenient to public transportation, the bus and U.The best is the staff, the reception couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. They recommended restaurants, made reservations, helped with directions etc. There is also a very good restaurant at the hotel - we had a very fresh sole one day for lunch.The rooms are a modern design, very comfortable beds, wonderful bathrooms, of marble and highest quality fixtures. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good location, not in city center, but close to train. We stayed one night on our three week tour of Germany, Austria, and Czech Republic. The hotel is in Rick Steve's tourgide. It is in West Berlin right off a main shopping and dining street. The hotel has parking in the rear. The hotel is modern and clean. The staff was freindly. Our room was large with king bed, walk in closet, a little air lock that provides two doors to the hall which helped with noise. We did not realize that there was no air conditioning but we arrived late on a cool evening after a long drive from Munich. We asked for dining reccommendations at the desk as Rick says there are plenty of resturants at a square by the S-Ban station, however the desk clerk said we should not go in that direction. We were all over Germany and never felt un-safe but we were more concerned in Berlin, probably because it was our first time there and the way American's think about Berlin. We opted to leave the hotel and go right to a main street with several resturants. Some resturants were closing and after being in Germany for a least a week we were getting tired of pork and potatoes. We found a little Chinese resturant back an alley way off the main street. It was called Hole in the Wall in Chinese. Food was great, don't order an entree for each person unless you are really hungry. It was late and the staff sat down and ate at a large table in the rear towards closing. It looked like a family operation. We were glad to see they did not order pizza delivery!.

<Content>Great but take earplugs Stayed at the Heckers with my partner for 4 nights at the height of Berlins heatwave 28 July 2008 to 1 August 2008.The location of the hotel was good as it was in the main area and there were plenty of taxis nearby. The room was a double, well appointed clean and spacious.The radio actually worked. My only criticism was that there was no air conditioning meaning that I had to leave the large double glazed windows open and here lies the problem.Just accross the road was a bar that stayed open all night and was well attended until the morning 6 am one morning meaning noise all night if the windows were open or a very stuffy, hot room if they were closed.Apart from that nice accomodation staff and location.

<Content>Lovely hotel! Great hotel with very large rooms, nice bathroom and a walk-in closet! The furniture is however dated but that is just a minor problem since the overall impression is very good. I loved the breakfast, the wonderful staff and the location - 1 min walk to the big shoppingstreets. I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>worlds comfiest bed! Stayed here for New Year (silvester) in2004/2005 with my fiancee. We'll always remember Hckers for the amazingly comfortable bed. It was large and so comfy. The room was pristinely clean and the walls seemed to be totally sound proof which is always good in a hotel. The curtains totally blacked out any light from the window which meant not waking earlier than intended, a great thing for new years day. The bathroom was a gorgeous Italian style marble tiled one with a great shower and tv. The breakfast, as far as I remember was decent and we used the restaurant once, which was nice but pricey (I've had better for the same kind of price, although it was good food). Good spot in a great city. Would definitely stay here next time in Berlin.

<Content>Great hotel We have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel. The rooms are large and airy, with modern clean bathroom and separate dressing room. The service was excellent, the staff friendly and helpful and the breakfast, although expensive, was exceptional with caviar and smoked salmon among a great variety. The adjoining restaurant offers a good menu and is stylish and relaxing. The hotel is in a great position for all the main tourist sites, as well as some of the best shopping in Europe. Overall I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Beware of Summer at Hecker's Hotel So most of the reviews of this hotel are accurate - good location, friendly staff, big rooms, modern-ish (although you can tell the heyday of this hotel was sometime in the late 70s), etc. However, pay close attention to the hotel's website that advertises that most of their rooms are air conditioned. We arrived in Berlin to 35 degree heat and received a room that wasn't air conditioned. The woman at the front desk agreed that ths was a problem, as it was very hot outside, but not enough of a problem for her to do anything about it. Try opening the windows, she suggested. The room was large and lovely and had very big openable windows, but when it;s 35, opening the windows doesnt do much. Not to mention the restaurant downstairs and the bar across the street that stays open with loud music and yelling patron until 5am every night, which made sleeping with the windows open rather uncomfortable regardless of the heat. We asked every front desk person we encountered for a fan and were told there was no such thing at this hotel. Eventually, on our last night, a small fan appeared in our room. We were greatful, but for 120 dollars a night, I want air conditioning. We could have stayed at the Swissotel for the same price - and maybe should have.

<Content>Good location and correct services I've stay a nice weekend in Berlin. This hotel is well located, just by u-ground station and in centre of Ku'damm, the nice boulevard of Berlin. Rooms are correct, large and adecuate. The reception desk is small,and the breakfast room is open, but breakfast itself is excelent. Nice stay.

<Content>Bait and Switch. This seems like a lovely hotel, although I wouldn't know. I researched my stay on trip advisor before traveling, and decided that this is where I wanted to stay in Berlin. Combined with a decent price from hotels, I sprung for the deal.When I arrived, I was told that due to a problem with the internet (whatever that means) my reservation had arrived too late, and they were over booked. I had made my reservations over a month in advance and found out on my arrival, so this didn't make too much sense: but what was I going to do.I was taken to their sister hotel, the Domus Hotel which semi-decent, and did not ruin my trip, but the Domus is something like 2 and a half star hotel, instead of the 4 star Heckers that I was expecting. The Heckers staff were sympathetic, but offered no compensation and it really seems like this whole thing should never have happened.The moral of this story, is either to avoid the Heckers, or to avoid hotels; or at least the combination of the two, as good things have not resulted for me.That aside, it appears from the outside to be quite nice, if perhaps a bit too trendy for its own good.

<Content>Right in the Heart SO conveniently located and quiet and friendly, I hesitate to tell too many people how great this place is. Skip the breakfast; it's not worth the 15 euros, especially with so many bakeries and coffee shops and patisseries all around.

<Content>Ideal Hecker's has a wonderful location: a quiet street, a hundred yards off the Ku'damm, within easy walking distance of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gedaechtniskirche, Zoo Station, KaDeWe, the U-bahn and lots more. The hotel itself is well appointed, the staff friendly and helpful, the rooms spacious and comfortable (ideal for a longish stay--in our case, two weeks) and the breakfast buffet the best we had in Germany. All told, the ideal hotel for a Berlin holiday.

<Content>Location, location, location! Heckers Hotel is situated on a quiet side street just off Kurfurstendam within two minutes walk of the S-Bahn and numerous and varied restaurants and bars. We stayed here for four days in July 2002 - the spotlessly clean room was the biggest I have ever stayed in, complete with a walk in dressing room with safe and minibar, good marble bathroom and comfortable bed.Staff were polite and unobtrusive. Buffet breakfast was enormous. Some hotel websites can be misleading but what you see is what you get at this hotel web site - a modern, comfortable and stylish hotel in one of the best locations in the city.
