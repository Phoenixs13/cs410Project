<Content>Unplug at RIo Grande My husband and I checked into Rio Grande for two nights so we could take in some hiking in El Yunque. Advertised as at the foot of the El Yunque rainforest, Rio Grande is situated on the opposite side of El Yunque from the park entrance, so requires about a 20 minute drive to the park's trails. The stay is bare-bones, but pleasant. We found the room to be very dark - with very little lighting provided - but the service was decent and our stay was quiet. The sounds of the coqui and other night wildlife easily drown out cars passing on the nearby road, but can keep you awake at night if you are a sensitive sleeper. We probably would not stay here again, but thought it was an interesting experience in a beautiful natural setting. The low cost and setting would make this a nice stay for families, but not as much for a romantic getaway.

<Content>Don't pay a dime until you tour this place. The web site makes this place seem vibrant, clean and full of activities. We arrived to find a resort that was in an advanced state of disrepair and deserted. The rooms were dirty and the circulating pump for a once-beautiful pool was sitting on the side of the deck pumping water into the air. Unfortunately, before our visit when I had asked to hold a room, they charged my credit card the full amount and they so far have refused a refund. If you want to check this spot out, be sure you do not give credit card information. You will have no problem getting a room on a walk-in basis. We paid the full amount and walked away without staying.

<Content>Better than El Yunque!!! Rio Grande Plantation is a jewel. We had just come from a week on Culebra so we were relaxed and peaceful. The drive from Fajardo to the Rio Grande Plantation was culture shock with traffic jams, loud music blaring, and tons of people. Rio Grande Plantation took us back to the peacefulness of Culebra...only at the rain forest instead of the beach. The owners are so gentle and accommodating. Hotels.com had botched our reservation and had us arriving at a different date. We were lucky there was even a room available. The one room open was one of the more expensive outside rooms and our reservations were for the less expensive inside rooms. The owners gave us the expensive room for the less expensive fee. BTW, don't do the inside rooms. The outside rooms are worth the extra.The rooms are great and the facilities mostly 4 star quality. Remember, you are adjacent to the rain forest. There are frogs, turtles, birds, and tons of plants. Don't get freaked out if the pool, as fantastic as it is, has a few leaves in it in the morning. Let the frogs serenade you to sleep, take a midnight dip in the pool, walk through the grounds, and enjoy the rain forest.We had two teenagers with us so you know they need activities. Rio Grande has the great pool and they have an outside covered activity room with two pool tables and two ping pong tables. There are arcade games as well, but they were unplugged and didn't look like they worked. That brings up the realization that this hotel/convention center was once a huge enterprise run by the current owner's father. They have outside covered pavilions with the potential to host hundreds of day visitors . I don't think that is occurring now so the hotel guests have this huge facility to ourselves. It offers private walks through the trees and bamboo, watch the turtles, and photograph the flowers. I'd suggest calling the hotel directly to ensure your reservation and to speak with the owners. They are good people and are working hard to keep this facility top notch. We are definitely returning.

<Content>DON"T STAY HERE!!! This place may have been nice 20 years ago, but nothing has been updated since. Everything was rusty, the fixtures, the pool. The place was deserted! We did not see another guest the entire time and it took 30 minutes to find an employee. The cable didn't work, the restaurant was abandoned. I suggest finding something else!!!

<Content>We loved it My daughter was visiting me in Puerto Rico (where I recently moved in, but live on the west coast) and after spending two days in posh, urbane El Convento in Old San Juan, we decided to spend a couple of days enjoing nature in general and El Yunque in particular, so we chose the Eco Resort. We arrived in the early afternoon at Thanksgiving Day, when most of restaurants in Puerto Rico are closed. No problem, we were informed at the resort. They will be serving a traditional Thanksgiving buffet for an early dinner and offer to feed us an impromptu brunch right away, since we were hungry. My daughter is a sun worshipper so we chose a plastic table near the turtle pond in the full sun and the manager came running explaining that those tables could be dusty. So what? whe shrugged. It's an eco resort. We expect it to be natural, to be ecofriendly, not a pseudo ecoresort where everything is for show only, fake nature etc. By that time we were served a selection of tropical fruits, fruit juices, a very tasty (though way too big for anybody than serious hikers) cheese omelett with vegetables etc. After brunch we enjoyed the rustic ambiance of the place, enjoyed feeding turtles, swimming in the huge and sparkling pool, walking the trails around the resort and then our Thanksgiving dinner., which was included in our modified American plan (breakfast and dinner). After dinner we interacted casually with the other guest, who all seemed happy with the place, though a bit surprised that it was not fully packed. The management/staff was very attentive, the food was very tasty all throughour stay. Next day, after breakfast we experienced El Yunque and came back in the early evening.Lounging around the pool we noticed that on Friday the resort had a lot more guests than on Thanksgiving, some international ( USA, UK, Sweden) and some local weekenders.My opinion: if you are a vacuous snob who likes a show of luxury, don't stay here, but if you want a nice, ecofriendly place with good food and attentive staff, you will like it.

<Content>Seriously....don't stay here! We found this property listed in several travel books including Fodors and off the beaten path. It sounds too good to be true and it is. We were the only ones staying in this resort. The second bathroom shower didn't work, the fans didn't work, the rooms had an outdated appearance. The pool was ok but the pump didn't work. The game room was a graveyard for broken video games. We came somewhat late in the day and thought it might be nice to have dinner there...they charged 30 dollars a person for rice, beans and chicken! Rumor is that the property is in bankruptcy and they are waiting for someone to buy them out. Good luck.

<Content>Bizarre/ twighlight zone We arrived during heavy rain in the mid-afternoon and made our way to the registration building. Oddly, the lights were on but NO ONE was to be seen anywhere. We waited a bit in the registration lobby and were surprised to see a large mouse walk by us twice. After waiting and not seeing anyone OR seeing a sign of what the procedure to find someone was, we began walking around the property. There appeared to be several very large banquet rooms and terraces for large events as well as a very large pool area. As we walked, we still saw NO ONE!! It looked like the place was deserted. In the lodge building there was what looked like a registration desk, but no one was there. There are not many rooms. As we walked through the tile floored lodge, all of the room doors were open, and it appeared that no one was staying there. We finally located a phone and called 0. After some difficulty getting someone, we were asked to wait. We were then finally checked into one of the smaller rooms with no view to speak of. It was clean and modern. Staying there was somewhat eerie; we were the only guests in the place. We looked in some of the other rooms (doors open all night), and some of them were quite large with kitchens, semi-private balconies, and/or several bedrooms. Very secluded location. Buildings somewhat rough around the edges. Not worth the high price for the quality.

<Content>Don't stay here We wanted a place close to El Yunque and booked here from Old San Juan. It has potential but the whole place is in need of attention. We booked a 2-bed 2-bath suite for four. We were the only ones booked at the place! I guess that should have told us something. The toilet didn't work but, luckily, there was someone to fix it. When we later took showers before going to dinner, we discovered that one of the bathrooms had no hot water. We looked around for someone to help us with this and there was no one to be found. The next morning when we checked out we told the clerk and asked for a discount. We thought it would be fair to pay for a 1-bath place which was $50 less. The clerk told us she couldn't approve this and the manager wasn't there to be able to approve this either. We were not able to hang around for the manager. Not happy... Don't stay there. Basically, it's a dump.

<Content>Eco-Resort very disappointing Described as a special treat, a bit of luxury, but was in fact a sadly neglected, decaying bunch of buildings surrounding a lovely large swimming pool. If only they could attend to the entire place the way they do the pool. The 'villas' reminded me of cheap, rundown hotel rooms, with rickety rusted railings and bathroom fixtures. Electric outlets that didn't work, a shower that leaked through the wall into the entry way, decrepit, cheap mass produced appliances and furniture.... Though the staff were wonderful, they were quite scarce. This was terribly upsetting when we couldn't find a phone that worked, or access to a computer with internet hookup, and my sister's husband is in Iraq. At $250/night I expected better.
