<Content>Love having a kitchen... I've stayed at Citadines before so knew what to expect. You get a basic room with no daily cleaning. No cleaning is great for those of you who feel they need to clean before the cleaner comes in. Room gets messy but you can keep it messy in peace. Having a kitchen is the real benefit. There is a Kaiser grocery store across the street which was very convenient. Also nice was the free coffee and tea in the lobby. Had 2 beds pushed together - not a sofa bed. Had Internet in the room but Wi-Fi only in the lobby which was strange.Subway is not that close and the line goes nowhere but the bus system is AMAZING in Berlin. Fast and convenient and you get to see the city at the same time. Only a few stops to zoo station which is a main hub to get you around berlin. Location was good but most tourist sights are in the East so was a bit far but still a nice area.

<Content>Great Location, Good value Apartment Hotel Excellent Location , close to bus, metro ,shops ( K-dam). Clean, pleasant staff.

Berlin is a geat city for a short break.

<Content>Great Apartment We really enjoyed our apartment at Citadines, Olivaer Platz. It is well equipped and the location is great with bus and underground stops very close by. There are some lovely restaurants just across the road too. We found the staff extremely helpful and pleasant at all times. Shame that the double bed is actually two singles pushed together as they parted company during the night! The apartment was clean on arrival and we were informed that they only clean weekly so we were prepared to tidy up after ourselves. There is a laundry in the basement so towels etc can be washed if necessary. The apartment is a great place to base yourself in Berlin and we would definitely use it again.

<Content>Big romm, small breakfast, non existant cleaning I was in Berlin, and decided to stay one more week, after trying to maintain the same hotel (no room available for the period) search at hotel.com, and made one mistake deciding to stay at Cit apt Olivaer Platz. The breakfast is small, awful, do no replenish, Internet line was down 4 of the 7 days, the room is cleaned before your entrance, but only once per week after, you must take care of the bed, and of course do no change bed cloths. For the same money they are much better places.I have traveled to Berlin due to my painting business [--], more than ten times, and that was the worst hotel. The area is good and communications also are very good.

<Content>Huge rooms! We were shocked at the size of the room as there was a dining area, kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom. The floor to ceiling windows were lovely as they made the room very light. It was so clean and modern and within easy access to the attractions of Berlin. There are probably better locations to stay in Berlin as we usually had to get a bus or two to the sights but we didn't mind. We had a wonderful 5 night stay here, the only down side was a rude staff member who may have been management who was very condescending to us as a group of teenage girls.

<Content>Great Time Stayed in Berlin for weekend short break with three friends. Booked Citadines as I stayed in one in Paris two months ago and it was ok. Citadines Berlin exceeded my expectations. The room was really clean and well laid out. I slept on the sofa bed which was quite comfy. The duvet was also very comfy and warm. The staff were very helpful and informative. The hotel was in an excellent location, close to public transport and shopping. The area seemed very safe. I would not recommend the buffet breakfast. Not much choice and bland. Next door to the hotel is a cozy cafe which made amazing food and coffee - for half the price! When I return to Berlin, this is the hotel I'll be staying at.M, London

<Content>Great centrally located apart-hotel we stayed at the citadines from March 21- 24, 2007. We have a 10-month-old daughter and thought it would be a good idea to book an apart-hotel, with an attached kitchenette. What a find! We got a great deal- about 拢55 a day. It is very well located- close to the Ku'Damm and a short walk to the Zoo Bahnhof. The room is of a reasonable size, but does get a bit crowded with a baby travel cot! We picked up great take-out meals every night, as we ended up eating in the room because of the baby- there is an excellent italian place across, and a thai/sushi place a couple of blocks away.The only criticism was that although we had asked for a cot while reserving, and had also telephoned the hotel the day before to confirm the same, (since we were reaching the hotel at about 10 PM), they had not provided the said cot. The manager did get us one up about 20 minutes later, but he unfortuantely couldn't set it up that night. In addition, the breakfast bar does get a bit crowded if you reach late. They do provide a high chair for your baby however. The staff in general, is friendly and more than willing to help. I would definitely recommend this place for those visiting Berlin, especially if with small children

<Content>Great Stay We Stayed at the Citadines Berlin from March 21-25. This is a very modern and clean apartment hotel. This room really is a studio apartment, with a pull out bed, and kitchen. They do not offer and type of maid service if you stay less than a week. The location is fantastic, with a 10 minute walk to the S bahn, and right around the corner from the Ku'damm. The staff is very pleasant and friendly. Overall, we had a very positive experience and I would recommend this hotel for a pleasant stay in Berlin.

<Content>Perfect!! We stayed at Citadines for 4 nights over the new year. After a couple of weeks travelling through Europe this hotel was a breath of fresh air.All staff were very friendly and helpful, the location was excellent, the hotel was spotless and the room bright and clean. Our room felt more like a modern studio than a hotel room which was perfect. The hotel was also very good value.They've also got a laundry in the basement. We were able to wash and dry our clothes for 9 euros, which is a steal compared to most hotel rates.My only complaint as quite a tall person was that the duvet wasn't quite long enough for me, but this was a minor issue and won't affect most people.Would happily stay again.

<Content>If you want West Berlin and value, this is find. I've stayed in two Citadines in Paris, and found them comfortable and quiet, so I tried Berlin and was just as pleased. The location is a very good neighborhood off the KuDam with good restaurants in every direction. The staff was pleasant, and because it is an apartment hotel, they leave you alone! The little kitchenette, ironing board, and good sized desk are just what I need when I am spending a few days somewhere in order to feel at home. Only harumph was that the internet connection in the lobby was almost always busy and as people can smoke inside in Germany it was unpleasant for a non-smoker to sit and wait a turn. It would be better if they had a second computer somewhere (for non-smokers). But it was free, so maybe I shouldn't complain. If you don't mind a pull out couch for a bed and doing without a maid service... this is a great value. It is clean and most of all, quiet.

<Content>Good Hotel, in a great location Not long returned from a long weekend in Berlin, which my girlfriend booked with First Choice. We stayed at this hotel and it was great. The location of the hotel is perfect for the Kurf眉rstendamm which has loads of designer clothes shops, Bars, Cafes and Restaurants. Opposite the Hotel there Supermarket, Baker, a couple of cafe's and an Italian restaurant, which were handy.We arrived on a Saturday when there was late-night shopping until midnight, everywhere was still buzzing. The streets were lined with local vendors selling CurryWurst, Chinese noodles, crepes, sweets, beers, cocktails, which created a good friendly atmosphere. It was great.We stayed in a Studio which wasn't huge but it was big enough for a couple. I found it a little strange staying in a hotel room with a kitchen. Couldn't fault the kitchen though, it had a toaster, kettle, microwave, fridge and even a mini-dishwasher!The only bad thing i would say about the room was that it has a sofa-bed, which you have to pull out and fold away everyday/night. The pillows were rubbish and we has 2 single quilts instead of one double, which we didn't like.Our flight home wasn't until the late evening, but the Hotel provides a room where you can leave your luggage because you must check out by 11am, which was very handy. We found all the staff at reception were really very friendly and helpful. The reception area also has free internet access, even if you were limited to about 15 minutes.If you are looking for a hotel close to the centre, this is a good choice.

<Content>Excellent hotel with really friendly staff Excellent in a great location beside the main shopping street in West Berlin the Kurf眉rstendamm with lots of shops and restaurants. There is a supermarket diagonally accross the street from the entrance to the hotel. I was staying with my husband and two children aged 14 and 12. We were given two studio rooms with adjoing doors, this was a great arrangementinstead of a one bedroom apartment as we had two televisions, two bathrooms etc. The kitchens were very well equipped with electric toaster, kettle, dishwasher, microwave oven and fridge. My 14 year old daughter loved the free internet access in the hotel lobby as she was able to contact and talk to her friends back home. On our last day our flight was not until the evening and we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel for collection later. This was very useful. Finally the staff at reception were really very friendly and helpful to us and nothing was ever too much bother for them they were great. I would recommend this hotel and will look to stay at Citadines hotels in other locations in the future. Excellent hotel.

<Content>wonderful hotel in a beautiful area Nothig to add to the previous review. I agree with every word.Spent a wonderful week there in a 2 rooms apartment,The only bug is that the room is cleand just once in a week.If you want it to be cleaned every day, you should add an extra pay of 30 euro per day. For a towel changing it's only 10 euro.I recomment it to all Tripadvisor members and all my freinds.

<Content>suites with kitchens, air-conditioned, well-run apart-hotel! Immaculate, well-run apartment-hotel on Olivaer Platz on Berlin's West side. Comfortable, well-furnished suites with equipped kitchens, air-conditioning, laundry in the basement, and free wireless internet in the lobby. The beds fold out from sofas in the studio units, but they are the most comfortable sofa-beds I have ever tried. We never tried the breakfast (charged separately at 8 Euros), as it was easy and inexpensive to equip ourselves with three grocery markets nearby (one of them directly across the street). Dining options in the area were plentiful and quite convenient as well. The apart-hotel is just a couple blocks away from a U stop and bus lines on the busy main street of Kurfuerstendamm, so we found it quite conveniently located. It is extremely secure, with a locked front door you open with your room key. Best of all, when we left a digital camera behind in the room, the staff recovered it and returned it to us! The staff was always helpful and spoke very good English. Very reasonably priced for its quality and features, the Citadines deserves to be discovered by more Tripadvisor visitors. Stellar! Probably our favorite hotel in a six-city tour of major German and Austrian cities.

<Content>Good hotel/Good value too! Great location, although on former West Berlin, so not within walking distance of Mitte and the main tourist attarctions. Close to train and bus stops, very convenient connection with airport (bus 109 from tegel stops outside the hotel). Rooms were clean and big, staff spoke good English and were very helpful. Would go again.
