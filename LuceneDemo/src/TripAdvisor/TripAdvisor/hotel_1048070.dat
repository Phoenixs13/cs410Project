<Content>Loved it! This place was great. We rent the main condo and the connecting room to make it a three bedroom. It had a full kitchen and a small limited kitchen in the third room. It had three bathrooms which was perfect for the amount of people we had staying there. It is a great family resort also good for younger people to stay at. It is in a short walking distance to the beach and the downtown village which has a great nightlife. Overall, great times. You don't get housekeeping everyday but they do exchange towels and bed linens upon request. They also do one deep cleaning if you are there for more than 4 days.

<Content>Aquarius Vacation Club is not the Embassy Whoever decides to take their vacation at the Aquarius Vacation Club Resort think about it first? This was my first time there and when I went to check in I had to wait 2 hours before I could check in. The party that was with me also had to wait but they waited 4 hours until their rooms were ready. When we finally got into our room the floor was wet one of my guest fell. The room stuck because housekeeping left a dirty mop in our closet. There were cob webs on the top of our window and air vents there was cracked picture fame in our bed room, our sinks to the both bathrooms were clogged. One of my guests had the sofa bed and was awaken by two special guests (two spiders). Housekeeping decides when to come in without contacting anyone they even walked in on me with just my underwear on I was so embarrassed. I called the front desk and spoke with a gentleman named Luis Torres he was great he tried his best to accommodate me and my 13 guest that I convinced that this resort would be great. I asked to speak with the General Manager (Marilou Rodriguez) and she decided to contact me the day before I was leaving but we didn鈥檛 get the opportunity to speak. I got the opportunity to speak with her when I was at the airport leaving. She was very nonchalant she said there was nothing she could do for me now that I left the hotel I told Marilou I wanted to speak with her supervisor but no one returned my call. What a shame that the only customer service we received was from a gentleman who answered the phone at the front desk who took our complaints and try to do his best to accommodate us the best he could. The Embassy and the Aquarius share everything like the pool even the parking the Aquarius guest had to rent parking space for their vehicles. I was very disappointed with the management staff. The only one who seemed to have management skill there was the gentleman who serviced the front desk Luis Torres. Thank you Luis for trying to accommodate my guest and I. We really appreciated all the help you gave us.

<Content>Aquarius at Boqueron PR Our vacation started from San Juan Puerto Rico. The drive was long but quite interesting. Puerto Rico has some beautiful scenery and the greenest mountains. It was about two hours away. We had a dog with us because our dog sitter plan fell through and figured either they had a kennel close enough or they allowed pets. They didn鈥檛 allow pets, which was a disappointing because I have a medium to large dog that is very well behaved. Meanwhile I saw a lady smuggling in her little purse-sized pooch. Anyways, I talked to the front desk about it and they knew of a dog trainer in the area who could possibly take care of our dog while we were on vacation. We waited for one of the guys on the front desk shift to end and he led us to the place. It was in fact a 30-year police K9 veteran who now trains specialty dogs for the police. Our dog was in very good hands thanks to the hotel staff. Back at the hotel we took the elevator to one of the top floors (floor 6 is the highest) and held on for dear life. The hotel elevators, which are fairly new, creaked and made awful noises making for a scary ride. Very slowly we arrived at our floor. For those of you that are used to timeshares, one side has a studio with a bathroom and a mini-bar/microwave, and the other side has a full two room apartment. The studio had two double beds which made no sense to me because the second bedroom in the apartment had a king sized bed instead of two doubles. It would have made much more sense for us if the studio had the king sized bed. We had two couples and some teens so we wanted to have the couples in the master bedroom and in the studio with a King鈥nstead the kids ended up in their own studio because of the bed placement. It made no sense at all. That said, the beds were comfortable and the bed linens were very nice. The rooms are simply decorated but pleasing to the eye. This unit has a full kitchen so I was not expecting to miss mixing bowls, spatulas, or a pitcher, but it didn鈥檛 have any of those things. It had plenty of dishes, cheap pots/pans that did fine, and some small appliances. The units are almost on the beach so I was also expecting to find a broom so we could sweep up the sand that we brought in, but no broom. We also missed the 鈥渄o not disturb鈥?signs terribly! They knocked on the door promptly every day and one day I actually taped a handmade do not disturb sign on to the door which seemed to work. What we missed the most was the lack of a convenience store for some basic necessities. You have to leave the complex and find someplace in town. We found a nice supermarket about 10 min away by car. There is a town that you can go to but they seem to cater to the college party crowd. Once Monday came around, there was nothing open and hardly anybody around. Be aware that there is a campground connecting to the hotel. While I was there, they had a boy scout jamboree鈥ogether with the 5AM revelry and all of the sounds of a marching band/parade. It was awful and no amount of air conditioner would drown it out. You may want to find out if there are any activities scheduled for the campground because it made a huge difference once the boy scouts weren鈥檛 there. Overall, it is a beautiful place and we even got some fishing in, but you need to bring most of what you think you are going to need because 鈥済oing to get milk鈥?is a 20 minute proposition. The staff friendliness made up for most things though. Just make sure you have a car.
