<Content>Close to SeaTac We used this hotel to Park  Fly. $75 for one week (and one day) parking booked through the hotel using email. Cheaper than booking straight with Masterpark. Very convenient free Masterpark shuttle loads up right in front of the hotel. Only a few minutes and you are at the airport. On our return our bus driver called in our reservation number (we should have done it ourselves earlier) and our vehicle was still ready for us when we showed up only minutes later. Excellent Service for a Park  Fly!The hotel is older - we booked two adjoining rooms. Got one for free with their find a lower rate - we pay promise. They even sent me a $100 gift card for a future stay!. The other room only cost $79 booking directly with the hotel (using email). A much better deal than I saw on their website. Our rooms were at the back and had a view of a little lake. There was no street or air traffic noise, but we could hear people next door in another adjoining room. Comfy beds. I read the review about the bed bugs... and I did notice three bites a few days later. Perhaps it's a coincidence? No-one else in our party was bitten. The hallways seem old and dingy. No free breakfast available! We didn't have time to dine before catching our flight, and I would have loved to grab a bite.

<Content>Worst hotel I have ever experienced I have traveled the world and stayed in some remote small hotels that looked crummy. In all my travel years (30) I have never experienced bed bugs. I have now though after staying at this hotel for 1 night. I was so covered in bed bugs the next day you would not believe it. My flight was early morning and when I left the hotel I noticed that my back was itching allot. But I had to catch my flight so I just did not pay much attention. However when I finally boarded the flight the itching became worse. I went to the restroom and pulled up my shirt to look at why I was itching. To my horror I was covered in bites all over my back,stomach, legs. Lots of 3 bites in a row which is how the bed bugs bite. Awful. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Large, lovely room, very comfortable and luxurious I had never heard of Red Lion but now I will make a point to stay at one the next time I can. This one is directly across the entrance to the airport. You might expect it to be noisy but it was not. The staff were extremely accommodating. The room was spacious, they had free wireless internet and the bed was extremely comfortable. Everything was beautifully decorated.They have free transportation to the airport every 10 minutes, 24 hours a day.Don't miss the restaurant next door. The food is excellent and the wait staff is terrific.

<Content>Pricey but ok stay I stayed at the Red Lion for one night. The next day I left for LA from the Seattle Airport. We dropped off our car at Masterpark, as the hotel provides a free 7-day park n fly with one night's stay. We left our car there for 8 days, so I was charged for 10 days (apparently it's cheaper..). I was charged over 200 for the night incl parking. Looking back, I don't think I wouldve done it - quite pricey for one night's stay.Anyways, the parking was great, we got our car back safe and sound. The shuttle to and from the airport was convenient enough. The hotel itself looked pretty old and the lobby wasn't too nice looking. The room was comfortable, but looked sort of old. It was overall an OK experience.

<Content>A fine hotel We stayed at the Red Lion for three nights in June. Though close to the airport, airplane noise was not a problem. It appears to be a somewhat older hotel but is well maintained. The staff are helpful and friendly. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The only drawback was that it was difficult to adjust the water temperature in the shower.

<Content>Great for a short stay!! Promot airport shuttle, free internet, free parking.We needed to catch an early flight back to the East coast and stayed at the red lion. It is close to the airport, less than 2 minutes shuttle to the gates. Hotel shuttles arrive and leave promptly, frequently. It is a great airport hotel. There is a mall and several shopping centers about 1.5 mile away. We had a decent dinner there instead eating at the restaurants near the airport.We'll return again if we need to catch an early flight again.

<Content>Great SEA-TEC Location We were expecting a newer hotel instead of an older hotel that had been another chain in its past life. The good: excellent location, (across from SEA-TEC), free shuttle to airport, friendly staff, large clean rooms, plush pillows, nice eatery next door, very generous manager. The bad: unstable water temperature, bed had a ready made body indent so it was uncomfortable, room was stuffy and A/C would not cool it down. Unluckly for us, we only needed a room for one night and were looking for a comfortable bed and a nice shower in the morning before our very early flight back home. Because of our late arrival and early departure, we ended up calling the manager later the next day to let her know our situation. She responded quickly and we were offered a very generous rebate for our inconvenience so our opinion of Red Lion Hotels went up a notch. We would stay again if the price were right (under $100.00) and we could move to another room if the bed were uncomfortable.

<Content>It is better than I expected after reading other reviews. I rated this hotel above average because of the price I paid. I bid on Priceline, and for $55 a night, it was worth it to me. The hotel has an older feel to it, but the rooms are large and bed comfy. We had a bit of a hard time keeping the room cool and the bathtub didn't want to drain. The hotel does not look like the picture, it is multi-colored now. There are nicer three star hotels in the area however, so I would look around. If you bid for a thee star and get this hotel and a good deal, it is a decent place to stay.

<Content>Great hotel. I'll be back. My wife and I stayed at the Red Lion at Sea-Tac in early December 2007. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room rate was very reasonable. The restaurant next door served an excellent breakfast, which was included in the Roaring Start room rate.Five stars to the Red Lion at Sea-Tac. We will stay there again whenever our travels take us through Seattle!

<Content>Okay, thought we were at the old Red Lion but they changed locations Although we have stayed in the Seattle area overnight for about 50 years we haven't used the Seattle airport hotel area for over a decade until now. We didn't realize that the original airport Red Lion had become the Double Tree. However, the price was right in October at their present location and the hotel was average. The restaurant was okay. But, we are overnighting again in early March and find their rates have almost doubled in the interim. So we booked into La Quinta at half the Red Lion's rate, in addition, comments and ratings in Trip Advisor give LaQuinta raving reviews compared to general opinion about Red Lion airport hotel.

<Content>Seen Better Days This was a Priceline stay, and it was rated 3*,This property has seen better days, like 25 years ago.It was nice once, I'm sure. Now, it's very dated withparts of old features still around. It was very closeto the SeaTac airport. They don't have their own shuttle,you use one of the parking lot buses. There are four,I believe; A,B,C, and D. That's confusing, only one works. My room was large, but it had an irregular shape.Things all worked, but the bathroom was outmoded.The employees were OK, no one stood out.For a 3* property it did not make it. This Red Lion is 2.5* at best.

<Content>Not going back There were two ladies that worked there that were friendly, but other than that, everything that could go wrong, did. The evening we checked in I went to draw a bath, to find hair still inside the tub from the last guests. The tub took over 20 minutes to drain afterwards, and I had to stay in the bathroom to move the plug because it kept stopping the flow. The next morning in the shower the water temperature went from scalding hot to freezing cold in a matter of seconds throughout my entire shower - the shower would not stay at a constant temperature. That day, we couldn't get the heater to turn off in the room, so we went out and left the window open to cool it off. On our way out we talked to the front desk about the shower, their only response was, Wow. I've never heard of that happening. After dinner and a movie out, there were no parking spots left in the parking lot, or anywhere nearby for that matter. After circling for 15 minutes, the manager told my husband to park in a spot that was partially blocking the fire lane and so far into the driveway that we almost got hit twice as we were parking. When we got back to the room that evening, there was a large beetle laying on my pillow. We decided to sleep on the second bed in the room in case there were more critters. As I pulled the sheets back I saw a small pile of hair. The evening manager was curt and even arguing with valet staff in front of a lobby full of guests, he is the same one who told us the fire lane spot was safe to park for the night. In an effort to avoid a ticket, my husband had to go back down an hour later and move the car. I would have expected these types of things from a Motel 6 (although I have seen some very clean Motel 6s), but not from the Red Lion. Staff was informed of our concerns verbally as well as through a comment card, so far no attempts have been made to remedy the situation.

<Content>Upgraded to avoid problems and was let down I choose a more expensive hotel then some of the others hoping that I wouldn't have any of the problems that you normally experience when you book with the cheaper hotels - boy, was I wrong!The air conditioner worked for the first 10 minutes and that was the end of that. The staff said they had their maintenence guy on the roof fixing it, but it wasn't fixed the whole time I was there. After three calls to tell them how hot and stuffy it was, they finally provided me with a fan just so that I could sleep.The toliet didn't work properly. Flush it once and no more. We finally figured out you have to take off of the backside top cover, peer down into the tank to see what's causing it not to flush again, see nothing, put top cover back on, and guess what? it's ready to flush again. Too Weird !!I was informed that the TV satelite was out, so we couldn't watch any of the free channels that they say are included with the room. To be able to watch a movie we had to purchase it, at $12.00 per movie. Rip off all the way around !The front desk clerks were okay, but not friendly. The pool was a total disappointment - small and it's behind the resturant.Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere other than here.

<Content>When a travel agent tells you not to go...... The Red Lion is a decent hotel with complimentary shuttles to the SeaTac airport, but their staff is incompetent beyond belief. Our room had been booked with 7 nights of free parking, so when they told me that was no longer an option and that I had to pay (in which case I would have just parked in the economy lot at the airport), I left a message with the manager to ask why it had been posted as free parking. When I hadn't heard back from the manager after not 1, not 2 but 4 messages on her answering machine over the course of 3 days, I became appalled at their lack of not only customer service, but lack of listening to a customer complaint. If you do decide to stay at the Red Lion, be aware that if you have a problem, it will fall on deaf ears.

<Content>excellent choice! We stayed at Red Lion Inn after being denied a room elsewhere confirmed through Hotwire, needed a room at 10:30 PM and most all everywhere were booked. We found the rooms large, super comfortable and a staff that was extreemly helpfull. We refered the hotel the next day to friends who needed a room near the airport.

<Content>A Dive with some spa-like touches What a miserable night. My non-smoking room reeked of smoke, the toilet would only flush if I held down the handle for close to a minute, the room was very dark, even with every light turned on, and when I tried to work out in the tiny fitness room, the treadmill was broken. Everything was kind of dingy and I was extremely relieved to check out! They did put out some Bath and Body Works products and a nice robe, but it didn't come close to offsetting the bleak environment.

<Content>The hotel was fine but the staff are incompetent I booked 2 rooms for one night at this hotel through Hotwire, so we got a good rate of $79/night. We had a pleasant stay. The rooms we stayed in were clean and big, the beds comfortable, and the bathrooms were updated and great. The outdoor pool has definitely seen better days and even in the middle of July, it was VERY cold. BUT, the jacuzzi hot tub was a nice relief from the cold pool. The shuttle was quick and a nice convenience to get to the airport (hence our whole reason of staying here).So, all in all, this would have gotten a better rating, however, in our mad rush to leave at 4 am to catch a 6 am flight, we had left behind our 2-year olds' favorite stuffed monkey. I called the hotel as soon as we landed and thankfully housekeeping found it. I was so happy that they found it since my son doesn't sleep well without him.Since then, however, it has been one incompetent desk worker after another. It has been 10 days since they said they would mail it and IT IS STILL THERE! We have spoken to five different people and every one of them can't seem to understand how to stamp, address and mail a package. Every time we call about it, there's a different issue. The first time, they didn't have our credit card information (obviously someone didn't write it down but then neglected to contact us to ask for it again), the second time they said they didn't have our address (how many times do we need to give it to them?) and this last time, well let's just say they don't know why it hasn't gone in the mail yet (and they had the wrong name written on it). We've given up on them ever sending it so we're having a friend drive to the hotel to pick it up and mail it to us. At this point, I'm afraid of them putting it in the mail, it may never get to us.So, while the rooms were nice and accommodations fair, the staff leaves me to wonder how anything ever gets done there.

<Content>Not just Comfortable, CLEAN, Elegant, Safe and Great Room Service....A++ STAFF You know how it is when you are a Mother traveling with your eleven-year-old adorable (or so you thought) son, (who by the way, is a little person/dwarf = center of attention) and you go to another state, you've not been to before and you don't expect the worst things to happen to you i.e. lost luggage/tampered w/ luggage, and after 2 hours of wandering around baggage wondering what the heck happened to your baggage that never showed up...you finally lose it and report the insanity that is baggage claim!!!!! (THERE HAS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY! AM I RIGHT?) you get to that little phone that calls the shuttle to the place you have reservations for the next six days, and you think .... It's only going to get worse?Well, let me tell you. If it weren't for the fact that I picked up the phone and to my amazement, the shuttle was right there in front of us ready to take us with our carry-on (3 bags) only - fretting, stewing and etc., and you are whisked away to a Shangrila that is so accomodating in every way, that the fact that your meds you need to function are missing, plus, plus, plus...just seems to melt away. I LOVE THIS FACILITY.....FIRST RATE ROOMS (Just don't look at the carpeting in the hallways, it is a bit busy) but you get to your room, modern decor, amenities, the best pool and the largest spa/jacuzzi area - reahabilitating! Pillow top bed you never want to get out of, cable television w/ movies and NINTENDO lifesaver...But that's just the beginning. I had one crisis after another as we were attending a conference at the Hotel next door (boy am I glad I didn't get a room there!) and I physically was ill, no meds, had to go to er, back and forth and I never had a more enjoyable stay anywhere and I've traveled quite alot - abroad - five star...but this facility is clean, safe, food was great! (pricey, but you get what you pay for) but I have to say this, THE STAFF IS INCOMPARABLE! From the angels of mercy at the front desk to the angels that keep the rooms so sparkling clean and stocked with whatever, they are available when you need them - they don't put you on their schedule..I was never treated better and I have to tell all you Nervous Nellies and Mother's traveling with children this place really makes you feel like you are the only ones there - and the place was booked up!) I will recommend this property to any and everyone! Bear in mind, this is the Red Lion, Seattle Airport .. just so we are on the same page as they had another property within 9 miles of this one, so make no mistake, RED LION, SEA TAC - Thanks for the TLC..I will be back if you will let us!

<Content>Run down and dirty. Not what we expected. We used Priceline to book this hotel and since our rate was about 40% off the regular rate I didn't feel the need to complain. However, this was the worst Red Lion I have stayed in. It was run down and dirty. The room reminded me of a budget motel. The Priceline star level was 3 star upscale and frankly I found it to be a 1 or at best a 2. Needless to say, we were dissapointed. complained to Priceline about the star rating but as I said, did not feel the need to say anything to the hotel. I just feel bad for those people who spend $120 plus dollars there.

<Content>Relaxed at the Red Lion Due to airline problems, I had to stay an extra night in Seattle, and the airline put me up in the Red Lion. I had never stayed at one of these hotels before, so I was a little apprehensive. While the front desk clerk was not the friendliest person on earth, she wasn't entirely rude either. The room was wonderful, spacious, clean, nice bathroom. It allowed me to relax under otherwise stressful conditions.

<Content>Stay Away Stay away from this hotel! It is old and showing its age. Stayed here one night because of a missed flight and wish I would have stayed at the Radison next door. The hotel has walls so thin you can hear your neighbor snore next door. There was a breeze that night and the wind caused the windows to howel. Water in the shower would not stay a constant temperature and the staff at the front desk was less than wiling to help with any of your needs.

<Content>ParkNFly Beware My husband  I have stayed at many ParkNFly hotels in the Seattle area. This is the first time we encountered miscommunication regarding when the number of days for parking actually begin. This hotel has packages 7-day  10-day parking for a fee with 1-night stay. (Previous hotels actually had free parking)We were leaving 10/14 @ 6AM for Puerto Vallarta, Mexico travelling thru SanFrancisco  returning on 10/21 @ 11:30pm. When we checked in on the 13th, we paid the upgrade fee for 7-days of parking, MasterPark employees parked the car. Unbeknownst to us, our 1st day began the 13th when we checked in because they parked the car that evening. We should have parked the car in the Hotel parking lot for that evening, then handed the keys over in the morning, 3:30am prior to taking the shuttle over. However, while waiting for the shuttle we spoke to another party staying at the hotel  evidently someone had left their luggage in the car overnight in the hotel parking lot  it was missing the next morning. So...do not leave your luggage in the parked car!!!Needless to say, our return flight was delayed; we arrived at 12:05am at Seatac  to the hotel approx. 12:40am. Technically we were in the 9th day, so they charged us $16.99!!!! for each day over the 7.In summary, beware of ParkNFly offers that are not actually initiated  run by the hotel, the hotel staff may not be trained adequately. Clarify the exact dates included for parking with the parking company or hotel  have it in writing  initialed by the staff. Never leave luggage in parked vehicle. I feel very strongly that I couldn't possibly be the first guest to have this happen, hopefully it won't happen to future guests.

<Content>Did the job! I stayed here on business recently (Sept 2006) and found this hotel ideally located if you're here for a short business trip. The airport is only a 5-10 minute walk away and a trip to downtown Seattle is only about 30 minutes away (using the Seattle Express $12 service). Gregory's Grill serves some good food and the bar offers some evening entertainment (although I missed the Tuesday karaoke!). There is a pool and jacuzzi / sauna but I didn't use either. The pool looked ok but the jacuzzi area could do with a tidy up. Overall, a pretty good hotel and better, in my opinion than the Holiday Inn which I stayed at in August 2006.

<Content>thin walls - might as well just open up that connecting door The light switch didn't work in the room but not a big deal, just had to use the side table lamps. The biggest complaint was the door connecting to the room next to us. We could hear everything down to the person coughing and moving around on his bed. I'm not sure why these doors still exist. Bring some earplugs.Ate at Gregor's, the hotel restaurant next door. Very shabby place, doesn't look like it's been renovated since 1970 but surprising decent food, that is until we found the fly in my girlfriend's salad, still alive stuck in the dressing. The waitress was friendly and helpful though, comped us the salad and a dessert.Had room service deliver breakfast. I had 2 eggs, bacon, english muffin, 2 pancakes, juice. My girlfriend - granola in yogurt w/berries, oj. total bill - $28 :-(

<Content>Nice place to stay for early flight stayed at this hotel at 1st and last nite when visiting olympic park. The location is a big plus. it is right in front of seatac airport entrance. I could catch the very early fight within a short time. bed / bath rooms were comfortable without any noisy even it was such close to the airport entrance. parking lot spaces/area was a little bit dark and not enough. we needed to park in front the restaurant next door. swimming pool was not in the same hotel building and needed cross the drive way. No chance to try the brkfst, no comment on that. The hotel rate is reasonable, you can get even cheaper rate if you are using entertainment book discount. Just overnite stay for early take off or late arrival, i will come back to this hotel agian.

<Content>overpriced for what youget The airport security lines were 4 hours so we missed our plane. We called a friend who booked us in since it was close and we didn't want to sleep in the airport. This place turned out to be the most expensive hotel of our whole 11 day vacation. Was it worth it? Only as a respite from sleeping at the airport gate.The room was large, but we couldn't get the a/c to work well, they had no fans or assistance for us. The people upstairs were rowdy and kept us up, we called to complain but the desk didn't seem to care much. They provide robes which was good as we had no luggage, but we had to beg for toothbrush, razor and toothpaste. They would not give us a bottle of water but sent us to a dingy basement to buy them in a vending machine.The restaurant is across the parking lot and is only ok. It turned out that we finally had a great breakfast and a great lunch at the airport (much to our surprise). I wouldn't stay here again at this price unless it is an emergency. I wondered if they had raised their prices to take advantage of the thousands of people in our same situation.

<Content>Fantatic Value We stayed at the hotel for one night prior to a flight to Japan the following morning and were quite impressed with the overall condition of the hotel (which had been recently renovated) and convenient location directly across from the airport. We found the room to be very nice, but the beds were exceptionally comfortable (very important before a long flight!). I would definitely stay at the Red Lion again and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Nasty Waitress, horrible restaurant My Wife and I stayed at the hotel last week and found the beds to be the most comfortable that we have ever slept in. The room had been recently painted, however the bathroom plumbling needs to be updated. The toilet water tank driped most of the night and the sink needed new washers as the water was dripping from the spouts. The park and ride feature that the hotel has is one of the best in the Seatac area. Our dissapointment was with the restaurant. It does belong to the hotel and is in dire need of repair and customer service. We choose the breakfast package, which had only five items to choose from. I do not recommend this feature, no bang for the buck. Our waitress was the nastiest women that I have ever had wait on us, she was very abrupt, What do you want type of attitude. When we handed her our breakfast voucher I felt like she was going to explod. You know the same attitutde that you get from bartenders when you give them a free drink coupon in Las Vegas. There was a tour group going to Alaska that morning and she was very nasty to everyone, not just us. I comlained to the desk clerk after breakfast and doubt it that will make any diffrence.For lunch and dinner I would highly recommend the Roaster across the street, for breakfast I would recommend looking for a McDonalds or even eat at the airport, believe it or not.

<Content>Very Satisfied I stayed at the Seatac Red Lion one night, and also used their conference facilities for two days. The service was great with very helpful staff. I had a lot of details to work on for the conference, and staff was always terrific even though I probably bothered them quite a bit. Parking was free, the room was large and clean, and the bed comfortable. There were no noise problems either.The only complaints were that the bathroom was small, the building is a bit aged, and you will not be able to control the room temperature.Overall, I'd recommend this hotel. The biggest issue is temperature control.

<Content>Most Comfortable Beds in a Hotel Ever!!  The Hotel itself is a little run down, but the beds are just awesome! This comfy bed was worth the price. The hotel was relatively quiet considering that they are right across the street from SeaTac airport. Price is a little high.

<Content>Nice Room, Good Package We sought accommodations near the airport for our night prior to an early-morning airport departure. We also intended to leave our car with one of the Masterpark lots (their service has worked well for us on many trips). Red Lion Seatac's park-and-fly package combined both into a tidy, well-priced package - this property shares space with Masterpark Lot A, so the vehicles are professionally parked and secured.The room was simply furnished, but clean and modern. We felt safe and slept well. The clerk at the front desk was friendly and helpful. She was also quick to provide the proper paperwork when I inquired about airline mileage partnerships (you must join their guest rewards program, but through it you can have miles deposited directly to your AK Airlines mileage account).Overall, it easily met our needs and we would probably stay there again.

<Content>Lukewarm water in the morning and a shabby restaraunt... Stayed there night of October 18/19, 2005. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. However, from 6:45 AM until 7:25 AM, there was only lukewarm water, so I had to leave without a shower -- pretty third world! Also, the attached restaraunt was so shabby that I walked to the hotel next door for breakfast. Red Lion used to be the premier chain in the Pacific Northwest, but they are going down hill!

<Content>Very nice I was not expecting much after reading some of the reviews on this forum. We did a Park  Fly for one night on our way to Florida. I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel has obviously been recently renovated. The room was huge and nicely decorated. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bath, while not huge was clean and well maintained. Our only complaint was the room was a bit warmer than we would have liked and despite trying to play with the thermostat had to open a window to cool the room sufficiently.

<Content>We thought it was great! After reading all the reviews here, we were expecting the worst....Gladly, we found the hotel to be quite wonderful. Perhaps the other reviews were of the old Red Lion (now the Doubletree) or were before some rennovation they completed before our stay. The Red Lion I am reviewing is at 18220 International Blvd. For what we paid, the hotel was very nice. Our room was quite large, comfy, and well appointed, plus, the staff was not only friendly but helpful as well. The only drawback was the limited parking, but we managed to find a space each night just fine. As far as the airport shuttle, the hotel promises one every 5 to 7 minutes and we found that to be true. There is also a park  ride on property that offers airport transportation as well. Sorry so many people did not have as lovely a stay as we did.
