<Content>What to say, I liked it! Almost everything you'll read in these reviews is true. First it is an regular Ibis, second it is a little far from Subway station (even more if you are carrying you luggage like i did). But its location between a Corte ingles (a giant store) and a little mall is perfect. The rest is exactly what you expect. A nice Ibis with a nice view of Barcelona.

<Content>Ibis Barcelona Meridiana A clean hotel located 300 meters away from the subway station near a commercial center El Corte Engles Outlet and many shops and a cinema and many fast food restaurants. The staff is gracious and willing to help, breakfast is varied and excellent coffee, is my first visit to an Ibis hotel but I was delighted by room size, cleanliness and the way I was treated. Minuses that would be very thin walls but the neighbors noise can be ignored after a day of the Barcelona visited. It is easily reached from airport to the Renfe station St. Andreu Arenal or by bus or subway, but most easily reached by RENFE and is very profitable subscription to the subway for 5 days and is valid on all means of transport in common

<Content>it does what it says on the tin!!!!! WE stayed here because it was only 12 minutes from Catelunya square on the underground, of which is a 10 minute walk from the hotel,The hotel is to a high standard ie clean room bathroom etc, Breakfast 6.5 euros take it or leave it normal cold buffet type food never changing each day, but enough to fill up on.One night the hotel ran out of replacement bath trowels and were told they may arrive later that night, when mentioned that the hotel bill will then be free if not sorted out in 15 minutes they quickly purchased new ones from the department store,Local Supermarket under the hotel , and plenty of resturants cafes in the complex next door 2 local atm bank machines, surprised that the hotel did not exchange currancy overall a good hotel to use as a base and to chill out in the complex (Heron City) on return each night,

<Content>Great place (especially for the money) A lot of nice things have been said about this hotel, so I'm not going to repeat too much of it. While in the outer skirts of Barcelona proper, it is still metro-accessible and has a wonderful view of the city towards the mountains. And I later found out during the three days I was there that it was also very close to the Sant Andreas (sp?) train station where you can take a train to the airport. Nice sized rooms with double bed, but the mattress was on the harder side. The rooms are clean but the amenities are on the sparse side. Though I do appreciate the inclusion of soap dispensers for the sink and the shower - saves my supply for other later hotels I'll need them in. Bar opened 24hrs and the staff was friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel and any other of the Accor line for any of your vacation needs.

<Content>Nice Hotel For The Money I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights in May 2008. There is a convenience store right next door and a mall directly behind the property. The metro Fabra I Puig is a 20 minute walk away. The room was clean with a shower, air conditioning, and a beautiful view of Barcelona if you request the upper floor. A blow dryer required a 20 Euro deposit which was promptly refunded upon checkout. The iron was another story. We asked for an iron everytime that we walked by the front desk, was granted one on the third day and told that an iron is not guaranteed. We returned it the very next day in respect to other guests.  OVERALL, I LIKED THIS BASIC HOTEL AT 89EUROS NIGHTLY, AND WOULD STAY THERE AGAIN.

<Content>Nice location The Ibis is set in a resedential supurb with a lot of flats about it off one of the main roads into the city. It is a short dander to the metro and then 10 mins into centre it is also well linked by buses. It is good value, nothing special but does what it says on the tin.

<Content>A modern Ibis hotel I stayed last week at this property and found it quite ok, it was not hot and the air-con was therefore not necessary, it was February and very quiet.PRO:- easy parking just at the shopping centre next door, rate acceptable 16 Euros for a day - hotel modern, room well equipped, excellent bed, good TV offer, found room clean and comfortable, excellent shower ...- staff multilingual, professional and nice- breakfast buffet, quite good except for the baguette which was not fresh and the croissants which were covered with sugar ....CON:- area could be nicer, a shopping mall is really not the nicest position for an hotel ....- no restaurant but the receptionist gave us some addresses where we were offered discounted prices, in the shopping centre ASADOR LA PATAGONIA is quite good, excellent argentinian beef, good wines at reasonable prices, service very efficientALL IN ALL NOT A BAD HOTEL

<Content>fantastic Hiya, myself  Fella read some bad reviews on the Ibis at heron city and I must say we were a little worried !! All i can say is i'm so so happy we didnt cancel, Yes the hotel is very slightly out of the centre, (ten mins on the metro ride) however its a leisurly ten minute walk to the nearest Metro station, down a wide tree lined avenue, just to stop and watch the old men playing small silver ball bowling is a sight in itself. The hotel is spotless, the reception staff a fab bunch of people, and the bar staff were amazing, even giving me free liquers to choose, they were all kind and very helpfull. We ate in Frankie  Bennys, Pizza Marzano and Asador (steak bar) all were fab, if you tell them you are staying at the Ibis you will get 10% discount. All the air conditioning worked, and the rooms were cleaned every day to a high standard. DO NOT be put off by some of the bad reviews it was FANTASTIC, we will certainly be going again. Enjoy. Love Caroline  Ian (Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK)

<Content>Value hotel with three REAL issues My review is based upon these real issues:We stayed in the Meridiana Ibis from 2/3/07 - 5/3/07 (a weekend). BEAR this in Mind. The air conditioning is not switched on until May and our south facing room was stuffy and uncomfortable (28 degrees according to my travel thermometer. Barcelona was enjoying temperatures in the 20+). The windows have no handles so opening them is a REAL issue.I had to go to the Night Porter at reception to ask for the air con to be switched on to which he refused. His solution was to give me a handle for the window! (bizarre). On opening the quadruple glazed windows the noise of the music from the adjacent night club was unbearable (this went on until 6a.m. hence the super dooper glazing)We took issue with the manager the next morning who stated that the air con is indeed off until May. Her solution was to suggest switching it on during the day when other residents were out so the room would be cooler.Indeed she hinted that the residents may find it cold at night if air con remained on. I asked why not just leave on as individual rooms could turn up their air con to heat the room. she just shrugged her shoulders (maybe cost cutting???). The compromise was to move rooms to the rear of the hotel were it was cooler (north facing) but indeed on opening this room's windows the noise from the near by Heron City air conditioning units (contrary to the Hotel's being off!) was also loud. However the room was cooler so felt better with windows shut .On a positive note the hotel is value for money. it is situated in a nice part of town (the south facing views from hotel are lovely) with a pleasant walk along the avenue Meridiana to the Fabra I Puig metro (buy a T10 ticket for value for money = 10 trips for around 6.80 euros you can buy at the ticket vending machines on entry to the metro).For the weary traveler who can't face going back into town after being out all day, Heron City will offer some comfort in restaurants and cafe's. Try the Argentinian restaurant for something different- staff very helpful if needing translation of Menu's. Also all restaurants within Heron City offer 10% discount on bills if staying at this Ibis- the Hotel forgot to tell us this.We wouldn't stay here again not solely because of the issues with air con/ windows but also because in getting to know the city you notice more intimate/ with character accommodation. If staying from May- October when the air con is on you shouldn't encounter the problems we had.

<Content>Good value The hotel is located in an outskirt of Barcelona, right next to a shopping center, allowing you to get refreshments also later in the night. It麓s a ten minute walk to the next subway station which will take you to the city centre pretty quick. The hotel itself is a huge block of concrete, but if you decide to stay here you don麓t choose it because of architectural delights but rather because you want to save a few bucks. The rooms were average in size, but very clean, staff was friendly and the breakfast offered a good choice. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Filthiest IBIS hotel ever This is the filthiest IBIS hotel we've ever stayed in. From the moment we entered the reception area we saw a very dirty hotel lobby. We were given a non smoking room as requested, fair enough. However, The room clearly smelled like someone had vomited right on the carpet, there was the spot, and they put some sort of disinfectant so the combination of odors was absolutely disgusting. To make matters worse they don't allow guests to open the windows !! I was told by the staff that someone threw himself out of a window ,seriously, so the management had ordered the staff not to allow guests to open the windows of any room - in fact the window handle had been removed in ALL rooms, no exceptions. We asked and were granted a change of rooms the following night. However all the rooms seem to have a very bad smell, surely because they are not allowed to ventilate them at all. I would not stay at this specific IBIS hotel again, not even for free.

<Content>great, low price hotel. Ideal for football travellers My partner and I stayed at the Ibis Meridiana on March 31-April 3rd 2006. A very clean, well maintained hotel, that for the price I can't praise highly enough. A 5-10 min walk from the Fabra I Puig metro station, along a tree lined boulevard where senors play boules, or you can stop and watch a football match on the local pitch, The metro station is about 5 mins from Brcelona Nord bus terminal and 10 mins from Placa Catalunya. Heron City is behind the hotel with a cinema and a plethora of American style diners. (the best Frankie and Benny's I've been in). The only problem with the hotel is getting back to it late at night/early morning for party animals, the taxi queues in Barca are some of the worst I've ever seen. I'd recommend this hotel to people going over to Barca for the weekend. We took in el Clasico (Barca v Madrid) when we were over. Superb.

<Content>Loved the Area Six friends stayed at the Ibis Meridiana last week, 22nd to 25th March and found the location to be excellent. The hotel itself was well placed near to designer shops and restaurants to suit all tastes and close enough to the Metro with a 10 minute ride to the centre of Barcelona. The rooms were as you would expect from an Ibis, adequate, comfortable and clean. We especially liked the walk in shower wet rooms. Breakfast for 6 euros was sensational, plentiful and varied. The staff could have smiled a bit more but mainly were polite and helpful when asked a question. We would highly recommend this hotel for good value for money and location.

<Content>Ibis Meridiana - great value! We visited Barcelona in late October, 2004. While not in the heart of the city, we thought the location, for the price could not be beat. We paid 76 euros per night for a nice sized room that was very modern and up to date in a clean comfortable hotel. It was about a 10 minute walk to the metro station that took us to Placa Catalunya in 15 minutes or so.The Ibis offers a cold breakfast buffett for 6 euros that was not a bad deal. Since we're Americans, we felt rather comforted by the familiar looking environs of the Heron City entertainment complex next door. We really enjoyed our stay in Barcelona. It is a fantastic city with days worth of stuff to see and do. I'd highly recommend the Ibis Meridiana!

<Content>Beautiful Although slightly out of Barcelonas centre, this hotel is great value and maybe you get a slightly different perspective on Barcelonian life than you would if you just stayed in an overpriced hotel in the city centre? Each morning and night you can have a leisurely walk from the hotel to the nearest tube station along an avenue with boules areas, football pitches and park area and may catch a glimse of local life, with blocks of flats near by. The views from the hotel are also plesant. At night, looking up at the hotel, the top lights up in a multitude of colours which is great fun.The hotel itself is clean and tidy, with generally helpful staff. The rooms are air conditioned (which is a relief from the near 40 C temperatures we had when we stayed) with double beds, a shower room, tv with a wide selection of different language stations and blackout curtains. The hotel is located within Heron City, an entertainment complex with cinema, restaurants and bowling which can provide a plesant night out on your doorstep. Highly recommended for a stay in one of the worlds greatest cities.

<Content>Excellent bargain Having been saved from a 'bargain' cesspit by the reviews on this site, felt it my duty to report. Although the Ibis Meridiana is of course a chain hotel with no discernible character and is not in the main city centre, it is so cheap compared to the amazingly high prices generally in Barcelona, it was my final choice. The room was just fine: clean, spacious, stylish, no worries. Very very helpful  friendly staff too. The only thing that had put me off slightly (such a snob) is that it's situated in Heron City, an American style complex of bowling alley, Macdonalds etc. Maybe it was just the time of year (April) but actually it was rather nice - it's small and seemed to be only populated by locals having a coffee and letting their kids play on the automated fountains -you stand on buttons and make the water spray, it's got lights at night too!Not a particularly attractive part of Barcelona but you don't go for the hotel room, right? A short walk to the metro station, passing 'Old Man's Alley' as my son called it (boules playing in the local park)and just 10 minutes on the superb metro right into Place Catalunya.At 49 euros for the room, it was the cheapest I could find (apart from aforementioned cesspit).Thorougly recommended.
