<Content>Find something else! The hotel is new and if there weren't so many problems it would be a decent lower priced modern hotel to stay at., especially if you are traveling solo. You have to put your luggage on the bed or floor because room is so tiny. You cannot open the window shade so you can never get natural light in the daytime. The hot water always turned freezing cold after 5 minutes in the shower. The noise is horrible from the hallway. You continuously hear other doors slamming and people talking constantly in the hallway. I agree with HongKong Connie- you definitely do not need an alarm clock to wake up in AM!Pillows suck. The pillows are actually like the pillows you get on an airplane sitting in coach! Bed not so comfortable. Location is OK near Little India (kind of a pain to the subway) but they have to work out a lot of kinks before I ever stay there again. Next time I go to Singapore on a budget I think I will stay at the Keong Saik Hotel in Chinatown which has a great location.

<Content>Go for other options I paid for SGD110 per night thru the hotel website. The hotel is conveniently located, just 5 minutes walk from the Little India MRT.The room is clean, buy very small, cannot even open the luggage on the floor. I have to place the luggage on the bed in order to open it. The rooms has no sound-proof wall. Since there is no carpet in the hotel corridor nor the room, the floors are in tiles, I can hear people walking and talking on the corridor in midlight. You merely do not have to set any alarm or morning call, you will be waken up by banging sound from neighbourhood oening and closing their doors. And, on the first night, the people staying in my next door, keep on watching TV till 2am, I can clearly hear the TV sounds in my room, which is very annoying.Like other Hotel 81, there is no proper cloth-like pillow case, the pillows are covered by a paper-like case.I stayed for 2 nights. I dropped the key and asked the staff to clean up the room before I go out for sightseeing, but when I returned at night, the room was not cleaned up and the towels are not changed. I gave up and just brought the towel to the front deak for an exchange.Overall, the experience is quite a nightmare. I genuinely do not recommend it to anyone, given the price it charge, unless you are on a budget tour or cannot get anyother alternative.
