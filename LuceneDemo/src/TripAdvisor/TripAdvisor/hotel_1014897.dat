<Content>windsor hotel We stayed in Hotel Windsor from 11 oct 08 to 14 oct 08. The hotel is a comfortable 3 star hotel which offers the basic conveniences. It is a no frills hotel, which means you have to lug your baggage up to your room. The breakfast buffet was was not too inviting with limited choice available. The rooms, though comfortable were a little smaller than our expectations. Another drawback is that it is located away from the city centre so you have to make that extra effort to reach certain places. On the positive side, the staff is very pleasant and helpful. A unique experience was that there were no mineral water bottles in the room and on asking we were told that in Singapore everyone drinks tap water. Overall a comfortable stay.

<Content>Room/service good, but heavy noise from Karaoke bar untill 3AM Hotel Rooms/service/location etc are all Good , but i will never choose that hotel again, why?!! Hi All, i got a room in the 4th floor of that building , but in the 3rd floor they have a dance/karaoke bar, that creating a heavy metallic sound the whole night , untill 3AM . i felt like my ears are blowing it out, ( as i am from india, these western music was making me more annoyed on top of losing sleep, may be westerners like these music/sound!). when i contacted their desk service , the reply was i can change the room to some other floor in the next day !!).

<Content>Functional My first visit to Singapore and being there for work, the Windsor in terms of location was convenient and cost effective. It reminded me very much of a UK Travelodge style offer, no frills but generally clean and comfortable. I found all the staff to be helpful, even when the coach trips arrived (and there were lots of those) and the place was full. Not the place to stay if you are looking for character and/or somewhere to chill out after a day of sight seeing.Room safes were being fitted as i was there, and my iron and ironing board was efficiently delivered and left for my duration of the stay. I also managed to have an early check in and late check outs to fit around my flights with no hassle whatsover and the loan of the hotel umbrella's was great (still didnt stop the frizz tho!). I only had breakfast in the cafe and stuck to toast, coffee and melon as i still cannot face a full chinese meal for breakfast. I laughed when i read the review below, having stubbed my toes in the bathroom, every single time i went in there.... i didnt learn and it does hurt, so be warned!All areas non smoking, but my room did smell suspiciously of smoke and suprisingly no complimentary water. I was assured the water was safe to drink, by the cafe staff who were genuinely puzzled by my request for a bottled water. The garage next door proved to be useful to buy water and other odds and ends.As for taxi's, i always got the hotel to book them for me, there was a small surcharge, but i was happier with that than flagging one down outside on the busy road.All in all, ok, for a work trip or as a base only.

<Content>Good, not great We found the hotel good, not great. Would we return? Maybe.We checked into the hotel in early February '08 for a couple days. The room has a nice view overlooking MacPherson Blvd. The bed was comfortable and the mini refrig was great. Unfortunately, the tv had only two English-speaking channels and the lights over the bed didn't work. The furnishings in the room were worn. The bathroom was snug, the sink scratched. The sink faucets handles were different, rather than a matching pair. The bath tub had considerable damage (exactly how many heavy objects had been dropped into the tub??) and the tiles need to be replaced. The entrace to the bathroom has a marble base rising off the floor 1 which matches the carpet. It's hard to see and you forget it's there until you've stubbed your toe on it or stepped atop it in bare feet or socks. Inevitably, you bump or walk onto that damn thing. Hurts like hell. Note: wear shoes in the room.There's a large cafe downstairs which serves Chinese food. The food is quite good and the buffet is extensive. The cafe staff are lovely. There's Internet access in the lobby for a fee. Internet access is cheaper in shopping centers on Orchard Road.The front desk staff are very professional, too professional in my view. We found them distant and reserved. Neither of us felt welcomed per se. If you're looking for a warm welcome, this is not the place. If you're checking in while on a business trip, this might be a better fit.The hotel is located 10 minutes away from the main tourist area, and that suited us well. We were happy to grab a taxi and pay S$8 to reach Orchard Street or Little India. If you need a cab late at night, early in the morning, or during commute hours ... there are high fees added to the ride. Most taxi drivers are friendly and quite good. Some rip you off or try to. Be sure to keep paper and pen closeby. Each cab has cab # and driver's name posted. Singapore urges people to report errant behavior and provides the 800 number at all major taxi stops (airport, Orchard Road, etc.)The Hotel Windsor has pluses and minuses like any hotel. However, while travelling through SE Asia four weeks, this was our least favorite hotel. We may return, but we'll definitely research other options.
