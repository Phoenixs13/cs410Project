<Content>Our stay in Berlin Friendly staff, fair price and excellent breakfast buffet. Rooms were clean, the price was a bit more than advertised in guide book, but the Berlin Marathon was being held and all the hotels in Berlin were out to make a buck.

<Content>Nice place I stayed there for 3 nights while in Berlin. Nice place with a HUGE breakfast buffet!!!!! Very friendly staff and clean room.Garage cost 5,- 鈧?per day and seems safe but Berlin is a safe city so I guess I could have parked outside the Hotel as well.The U-Bahn is only a couiple of meters away and takes you in the heart of the city ( need to change at Bismarkplatz).nothing to complain about eventhough they charge you 2,- 鈧?for the 0.75L bottle of water in the room...But that's OK. I would certainly stay at this hotel next time because it's really easy to find and next to Charlotenburg. there are a couiple of eateries as well in the area. That helps.

<Content>Econtel Berlin - For tour groups only We stayed at this hotel as part of a Cosmos tour of Central Europe. This hotel was fine for a two night stay. The location of the hotel was fine, there was a supermarket next door, public transport was close and took you straight into central Berlin and the hotel was located close to the Charlotte Palace. From what I could tell this hotel caters mainly to tour groups. There were students staying at the hotel and we were in rooms with fixed twin beds. The room itself was reasonably comfortable despite the fact we could not join the beds. The blinds did not block out external light which was a bit annoying. The telephones did not work and the bathroom was not as clean as we would have liked. The breakfast was fine, although very busy with all the tour groups.

<Content>Would Recomend I have just returned from a trip to Berlin traveling with 12 girlfriends and we stayed at The Econtel Berlin. We had a fantastic time and found the hotel to be very clean and ideal for our needs. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable but the glass bathroom doors caused much amusement within our group! The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times, including the bar staff who were very patient with us and our numerous requests for swimming pool cocktails! Check them out if you go.The Hotel is conveniently situated for getting out and about with a bus stop right outside running very regularly into the city centre. My only complaint if any is the fact that there is no outside area to sit and enjoy their tasty cocktails! But there is a park about two minutes walk away.There are plenty of bars and restaurants all within an easy walk away. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit Berlin traveling with a group or a small party. We all had a fabulous time.

<Content>A good hotel for the family in Berlin My family of four stayed in the Econtel (not far from Tegel Airport) for two nights. The service was good and the room was quiet and comfortable. The wavey glass door into the in-room bathroom was a little funky, since you could easily see the outline of the person in the room! We checked out on the final morning and left our luggage in storage. My only complaint is that a group had stored all their luggage in the same room and it took me twenty miniutes to find a place for our bags!The hotel is convenient to the U-Bahn; excellent for a quick trip to the cultural sites.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, reasonably connected Despite some other reviews, we found this hotel reasonably connected. The X9 bus (at the bus stop just outside) gets you to the Berlin Zoo in 10 minutes. For those not familiar with Berlin, the Zoo station is a major transportation hub, being a bus terminus. The U- and S-Bahn stations are here too. Apart from that, the Mierendorfplatz U-Bahn station is down the street (200 m), and brings you to Schoenefeld airport with one change at Rudow.The hotel rooms are clean, the staff are friendly, and that's what matters to us. WiFi is available for free. No complaints on any other aspect.I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Between 20-40 minutes drive to center This hotel is not located in the center, it takes approx. 20 minutes U-Bahn to reach the closest tourist attractions, and 45 minutes to reach Alexanderplatz. If you don't mind this, you have found yourself a good hotel. The neighbourhood itself is quiet and safe.Although we had no hotel-shampoo or shower gel (must be the first time ever), everything else you need will probably be there, including free wireless internet and a good breakfast buffet. There's a big supermarket right next to the hotel, and (as like in the rest of Berlin) finding something to eat won't be a problem.

<Content>In a quiet street Wrong location, nothing around, U-Bahn station is close enough, but its on a line that requires changes to get in to the centre. Comfort rooms seemed pretty basic but the hotel brekky was very good with plenty of choice. I wouldn't stay again because of the location, it is not central to anything.

<Content>Dont stay at Econtel WE stayed at Econtel and booked over the internet. I naturally checked the Double room option as in past experience with booking hotel rooms, this results in getting a double bed. On arrival at our hotel, Econtel Berlin, we were given the keys to our room - a TWIN room with two single beds, that they classed as one of their Standard rooms. We showed them that our hotel Voucher clearly stated that a Double Room was booked and that we wanted a Double bed.The Manager at Econtel insisted that there were no Double beds in their Standard Rooms, and that a Double Room at this hotel (as stated on our voucher) was a room that slept 2 people. We asked to be moved to a room with a Double Bed, but the Manager stated that this incurred an upgrade charge and that he could not do this for free, despite the hotel being relatively quiet.I was certainly not impressed with the level of customer service that was provided by the hotel, and would not stay here again.

<Content>Wouldn't recommend booked late for a stay during the IFA show in early September which is why prices were probably a lot a higher than normal. Nothing wrong with this place but just wouldn't pay 150 euros for these rooms. as far as I'm aware Berlin isn't an overly expensive place so would estimate that this hotel should cost about 60-80 euros a night.

<Content>Great! Best Deal for the Money We stayed and were very pleasantly surprised. Family room included 2 sets of bunkbeds, and small desk with Mickey Mouse motif, freshly decorated. It was quiet, clean, and a great place to stay. Internet access in the lobby, elevator, and restaurant. Breakfast not included for us, but juice and coffee, etc. were free and available. Front Desk staff were friendly, and helpful, with 24 hour service. Bus stop across the street which is on the bus line to the zoo - you can get anywhere from there. Nice residential neighborhool. I lived in Berlin for 3 years, and this was great!!

<Content>Pluses and minuses Stayed here over Easter and booked the Easter package. A bit disappointing as the room was supposed to be the comfort class, but didn麓t seem any bigger/better than the normal rooms, except the twin beds were next to each other.Tiny (1.4m by 1.8m, honest) bathroom. Tip: to sit comfortably on the toilet, push the shower door inwards.....The included 3 course meal was no choice, although we managed to persuade the waiter to let us have a salad instead of the soup. Food average.Free parking on the street a big bonus. No problems.Hotel is used by tour groups, so breakfast can be a bit hectic.At Euro 308 for 2 people for 3 nights incl. one dinner (drinks excl)  breakfast just about OK on value.

<Content>good stay, good room, good location We had a great stay of 4 nights. Big room with king size bed. Free wi-access was a great bonus for us on extended travel. Very clean. Free safe in room which fitted our laptop. Car parking is free in the middle of the street opposite. It is not in the middle of the major sights of Berlin, but the X9 bus goes past every 10mins and takes you to Zooligisher Garten station (S  U Bahnhof) in 5min, where you can travel anywhere quickly including both the 100 and 200 buses which show almost all of the major sights. The X9 bus goes to the airport in the other direction. Bus finishes at 10.40pm, but the U-Bahn keeps going until 1am and there is a station about 400m from the Hotel.Reception helpful.School groups use this hotel, so you may have trouble with noise at night, but they were great when we were there.You will love Berlin!

<Content>Great wotif deal... My sister, my boyfriend and I booked the Econtel through wotif - triple for 85euro/night. Breakfast was not included. It is in a quiet residential location; very conveniently located near Mierendorff platz stop on the Ubahn and just outside is a bus stop for the X9 service to the airport. The room was certainly big enough for the three of us - we were on the second floor; and during our stay it appears as though they were renovating their rooms; though it certainly didn't impede on our time there. Room and shower were cleaned everyday; though no extras such as soap or shampoo were provided. Useful free safe in the room. There is also free wi-fi in the room which we made good use of - good download speeds ;) The staff were overall fairly friendly. I would stay here again if the same deals were available on wotif.

<Content>Spartan Accomodations in Charlottenburg Area Convenient location one block south of the Mierendorff U7 stop. Twin bedded room with no ameneties or air conditioning, although the TV carries CNN. Free Internet access in the lobby. It's a stand-up station, though, and there are usually people waiting, so don't expect to do more than check your email. Adjacent supermarket makes it easy to put together your own room service, but the absence of an ice machine requires some creativity.

<Content>the Frog Its distinctive exterior colour has earned it the nickname.Small quiet dormitory sized room, therefore it had less furniture than a standard European hotel room. No shampoo, no mini-bar (fridge). European air-conditioning (open a window).Convenient location and a supermarket next door, good breakfast buffet.
