<Content>Great hotel! We stayed two nights at this hotel, and had chosen it based on the reviews. And we were not disappointed. The hotel is very nice, the rooms ok, the breakfast very ok, you feel very safe. And also the breakfast room/bar is a very nice room to stay in. You feel at home and the staff is very helpful. Close to the hotel we found nice shops, the U-bahn, S-Bahn and buses are very close by and also there is a shop with gourmet food 100 m away. If I go to Berlin again I will definitely stay at this hotel. Perhaps I must add that before we stayed in this hotel we stayed two nights in a 5-star hotel in Berlin. That hotel was of course more luxurious, but not so personal and cosy as hotel Domicil.

<Content>Berlin base We stayed in Berlin for 5 nights and found the Domicil met all our needs. The hotel benefits from the close attention of the owners who clearly have trained the staff well - for example the extensive breakfast bar was regularly refreshed, even up to the end of the breakfast service.The hotel is convenient for the S Bahn, with Charlottenburg station only 150 meters away.

<Content>Great Hotel We chose the hotel on the basis of reviews outlined on a couple of different websites. We were not disappointed. We took a taxi to the hotel from the new main Berlin train station, and the fare was about 15 Euros. The arrangement of the hotel is somewhat unique in that one takes an elevator from the ground floor to the 7th floor to reach the reception desk. One takes another elevator from the 7th floor down to floors 2-6 where the rooms are located. The room was very nice, bath was quite large, internet service (wireless or Ethernet) is available in the room. It is not included in the price. However, we signed up for 5 hours of 鈥渙n and off鈥?use for 10 Euros which was a bit pricey buy nice to have. The buffet breakfast was included in our room rate, and it was very good: eggs, bacon, waffles, salmon, herring, breads, juices, coffee, tea, etc. The staff was very, very nice. At least two of the managers stopped by to visit with us on a couple of different occasions at breakfast and in the early evening when my wife and I enjoyed a cocktail before dinner. Berlin has an exceptional public transportation system of busses, U-Bahns, and S-Bahns. There are S- and U-Bahn stations right outside the hotel door which can be used to reach practically anywhere in Berlin. We purchased day tickets for 6.30 Euros per person which allowed us to make use of any bus, S-, or U-Bahn for up to 24 hours. The normal one-way fare is 2.10 Euros, so the all-day ticket is a bargain. The S-Bahn station also links directly with the new main Berlin train station which is very convenient.

<Content>Great Service Location: Not as central as some other hotels. When I looked at my Roughguides, the hotel seemed to be outside of the detailed map and that worried me a bit. However, it still very convenient as there are U-bahn and S-bahn very close to the hotel. The room: It is a three stars hotel so I did not expect otherwise. everything was good. the room was spacious. There were mini bar, tv in the room. The bathroom was a bit small but everything was functional. Plenty of towels. The bed was comfortable. I wish that the pillows were just as comfortable. Overall, it was very cleanThe Service:It is definitely its strong point. The front desk was always warm and welcoming. I agree with other reviews about the service. On my second day at the hotel, during breakfast, a server noticed that I was looking for some grapes in the fruit bowl. There was not much grapes left there. He told me to wait. He ran into the kitchen, got the grapes and brought it to my table. Also, as there was no iron in the room so I requested for one. Within two minutes, the iron and the iron board were brought to the room. The service is definitely 5 stars. Recommendation: I definitely recommend this hotel for a hotel of this category.

<Content>Loved this hotel We have just returned from a long weekend in Berlin and stayed at this excellent hotel. We found all the staff helpful and able to answer all our question from where's the best place to eat  whats the best places to go sight seeing in a short amount of time. The hotel was very easy to reach by train and underground.The hotel bedrooms where very comfortable with plenty of space, it had a lovely bathroom with large showers and plenty of hot water and a small kitchen area. Breakfast was excellent and being buffet style left it up to you how much you ate.Myself and five others stayed in 3 double rooms on this week-end trip and all agreed the hotel was excellent value for money.Hope this review helps.

<Content>Don't come in the summer. Berlin's summer has some hot day's, we arrived on such. There is no A.C., and we were told that  tommorow we'll get a fan. Other than that the staff went crazy when we said we want to transfer to a hotel with A.C. The beds are extremely soft if you like such.I don't know who wrote the previous reviews, but maybe someone on the management has decent english ( the staff don't).

<Content>Among the best in Berlin The Domicil exceeded all my expectations and is now my favorite place to stay in Berlin. For six nights, I was in total comfort and quiet, with one of the best staffs this city could offer. My room was spacious and spotlessly clean. King bed, pillows, armchair, etc. all very comfortable. Large bathroom with big walk-in shower and ample counter space. The hotel's decor of blond wood and somewhat minimalist art continues a theme of calm throughout the building. My room faced the inner courtyard.It took a moment to get used to the procedure of using the lift to the lobby on the upper floor, then going back down to your room on a lower floor.The breakfast area (lounge and cafe later in the day) has lovely views of the surrounding Charlottenburg area. The breakfast buffet was outstanding, including the full selection of eggs, hot/cold meats, fruit, pastries, cheeses, cereals, etc. and two things that always get good marks from me - a big working toaster and a friendly staff that doesn't rush you. The Domicil's staff was very helpful and competent and acted sincerely pleased to have you there. This gets so many positive points after the snooty, condescending staff at the Radisson SAS on the other side of town.The Wilmersdorferstrasse U-bahn is literally outside the front door, and an S-bahn station is two blocks away. Basic shops, bakeries, internet cafes are also right outside the door.Overall, I cannot think of any negatives.Highly recommended with a special commendation to the management and staff.

<Content>Much better than expected! We stayed here for 3 nights and were very pleased with the standard of accommodation. We had a big clean, modern room with a sofa etc. and plenty of space to walk around. There were rounded windows with a a view over the shopping streets below - many dept stores are 50m away and open until 7pm or later and plenty of places to eat, too. We had requested a cot for our young daughter and the staff had made up a lovely bed for her with teddy duvet etc. which was great.The bus stop is just outside the door and the U-bahn station Wilmersdorferstr is literally 20m away (something that was not clear from other reviews so transport links were brilliant).We would definitely stay here again. The only minor downside is the road noise so not really practical to keep the window ajar at night time.

<Content>Excellent value for money We have just returned from Berlin, and stayed at this hotel, which we found to be just like the pictures on the internet. We found the hotel to be of a very high standard and to be warm and friendly, staff were excellent and very helpful. The buffett breakfast was excellent and there was ample choice for everyone.The location of this hotel is excellent for exploring, as there is the underground 2 minutes walk, the s bahn is a five minute walk round the corner and the buses stop just up the road which means you can plan your route. The transport system was easy to get around on and ran regularly.We would certainly stop here again and would highly recommend it.

<Content>A+ for Friendly Staff I stayed at D.O.M.I.C.I.L. from December 3-10, 2005. The first impression of the hotel was a bit odd. The strange thing about it was the fact that the reception area was on the 7th floor in the same space as the restaurant/bar. To get to your room you had to go back down in another lift. Quirky but you do get used to it quickly.The rooms were comfortable and clean. Mine - 211- faced the street yet it was quiet and I enjoyed looking out at the people shopping. There were connections for laptops, a minibar and a cosy reading area. The TV had stations in English BBC world and CNN World as well as German stations.The buffet breakfast was yummy. Lots to choose from - breads, cold cuts including salmon, cheese, cereal and coffee. I also had an evening meal there and would recommend the cream of tomato soup. The service in the dining room was great. Very friendly staff. The receptionist was very,very helpful.The location was great as the 109 bus to Tegel airport was a block away. The shopping zone was literally at your door step and public transportation to other parts of the city was just outside at the curb.The nicest thing that happened was that on Tuesday morning I woke up to find that Papa Noel had stopped by my room and left a little sack with cookies, an apple, an orange and some chocolates hanging on the door. Such a wonderful touch. Made me feel special.

<Content>An excellent hotel The Domicil was a very good find, stayed for five nights in June 2004 and was very pleased with the accommodation and service. Rooms were very quiet, comfortable and spacious with tasteful contemporary furnishings, high quality beds and fine modern bathrooms. Staff were attentive and friendly. Rooftop restaurant with ample buffet breakfast. A high standard of hotel for a reasonable price. Just outside the hotel is a neighbourhood shopping district with supermarket and department stores and local restaurants. Excellent location away from the busiest parts of Berlin, but within easy reach of them by U-Bahn from the station outside the hotel or by the crosstown S-Bahn from around the corner. Also easy to get to Spandau and Potsdam from this part of town for day trips and the bus to Tegel Airport stops around the corner.
