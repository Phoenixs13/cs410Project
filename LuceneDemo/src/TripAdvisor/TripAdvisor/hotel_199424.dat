<Content>Definitely not a 4-star, would not recommend it Was my third time to Berlin, each time in a different hotel. I chose this one because it offered a good deal (3 nights for the price of 2 in a 4-star hotel) and because it seemed to be well located. Well, on both counts my choice was wrong.First, the hotel looks really ugly. Big (three towers), unpersonal, no room service, no air conditioning, poor choice in TV Channels, no shower products (just a gel for hands, body and hair....), and my room looked really gloomy. Things in favour of the room: it was clean, it had a fridge and some cutlery. But then I hadn't booked a studio, so it was quite useless. [NB: I cannot comment on the breakfast as I had chosen not to have it at the hotel. Indeed, it's normally quite easy to find nice bakeries in Berlin where to have breakfast for very low prices. However, it wasn't the case with this hotel as it is located in a residential area]As for the situation, the hotel is just close to the crossing of two big roads. As I were on the sixth floor, I wasn't too bothered by the noise, but I all the same had to sleep with the window closed. Regarding its location, it is in a residential area of East Berlin, that is, insereted between apartment towers, with no shops or restaurants close by. The surrounding are a bit gloomy (big bars of apartments) if you are there as a tourist. Well, at least it's relatively easily accessible with public transportation and you can reach a S-Bahn station in 10 minutes with the tram, which is by the way running all night. The hotel is relatively close to Friedrichshain and Prenzlauer Berg, two areas with lots of nice restaurants and places to go out.So what's the conclusion? Well, I expected better from a four-star in Berlin. During my last stays, I had been two 3-star hotels that were much more beautiful and well situated for comparable prices (the hotels were Agon Opera in December 2006 and Agon Frankfurter Allee in April 2007). In the end, I would not recommend this place unless you really just looking for a place to sleep. But then what's the point of booking in a 4-star?

<Content>Not a 4 Star The hotel overall was ok, we arrived late at about 11.30pm as our flight was delayed by 1 hour and found the hotel restaurant was closed at 11pm! The receptionist advised that there was nowhere in the area where we could eat as it was all closed, and there was no room service, there wasn't even a vending machine so we were all very hungry, this is the 1st reason why this is NOT a 4 star hotel, if the hotel is aware that it is in a remote area then i feel it needs to offer a later service, i.e room service for maybe for just sandwiches or for the bar to offer some sort of basic food. The room was unbelievably hot as it had no air conditioning, as its a city hotel you couldn't have the window open as it was too noisy  if you wanted air con you had to upgrade, come on this is the 21st century and this is now a basic requirement in 4 star hotels, so this is the 2nd reason why this is not a 4 star hotel. In the morning we were desperate for a cup of coffee but found no kettle and cups and as any traveler is aware even basic hotels have this very basic facility. i questioned reception and she advised that if i wanted this i would need to upgrade to a business room, so only business travelers need a cup of coffee in the morning and to be cool? so this is my 3rd reason why this is not a 4 star hotel. I cannot fathom how this got its standard but can only assume because its got a sauna, restaurant and Bar but surely the rooms count as well its the most important part of a hotel. So the std rooms really are only a 2 star and the hotel facilities are a 4 star. They offered money changing facilities but charged 10% and would not take the old 拢20 notes, even though they are in circulation in the UK.

<Content>Good hotel, a little out of the way My partner and I stayed here for three nights. The hotel is situated about 20mins by tram from Alexanderplatz and is located in an area of apartment blocks. However, despite its location the hotel was clean, comfortable and well appointed. The staff were very friendly, especially as I had been ill on the car journey to Berlin, and I didn't look to great when we arrived! The restaurant was good, once you get used to Berliner cooking! Breakfast was very good with loads of choice.

<Content>quality hotel...hot in an uncomfortable way I stayed at this hotel for three nights with my partner. The room was spacious, bathroom clean and linen of good quality. On the day of our arrival there was an old sandwich in the minibar, so I guess it's not checked after each guest. I threw it in the bin and mentioned this when we checked out, the woman at the reception was sorry about my discovery and said that something like that should not happen. I agree but didn't let this ruin my holiday mood. During our stay the weather in Berlin was hot and so was the room (24h), as it did not have any air-conditioning. Furthermore, the drapes did not darken the room efficiently so it got quite light in the morning.The buffet breakfast was great, there was nothing missing and the empty plates were replaced efficiently. Checking in and out were done without much cordiality. The hotel is not situated as well as hotel info lets you to believe, but you can get around quite nicely with trams that stop close to the hotel.All in all, I might stay here again, but only at a cooler time of the year.

<Content>A nice enough hotel, but off the beaten track This hotel was fine - not a 4 star though as indicated on the website we booked through! While the staff weren't rude, they weren't overly friendly - on arrival they just handed over our room key - didn't tell us where/when breakfast was, didn't even mention the fact that the hotel had a sauna! We only discovered this at the end of our stay!Slightly out of the way too, surrounded by car showrooms and not much else. Very handy to the tram line though - about 2/3 minutes walk - and this took us directly into Alexanderplatz. Trams run quite late into the night so it's fine getting back to the hotel after being in the city centre.If you're staying at this hotel you must eat at a little Italian restaurant just a short taxi ride away called Pizzeria Italiano (on the tramline to A'Platz)...great food and drink, lovely atmosphere, friendly staff and really cheap! (Less than 30euro for a meal for two)

<Content>Out of the way but very nice. This hotel lies in deep inside former east Berlin. It is quiet in the area without many activities around but that shouldn't stop you from staying here. The tram stops across the street from this three towered hotel. The rooms are very clean and well maintained. The staff jumps to every request.The restaurant has very good food and plenty of it.There is an Irish pub and a sports bar nearby for relaxing.The only downside is the location. Even though you can easily get there by using public transporation, I think most people would find it to be a little on the remote side. If you can get around that, then it's a good base station to tour around Berlin.
