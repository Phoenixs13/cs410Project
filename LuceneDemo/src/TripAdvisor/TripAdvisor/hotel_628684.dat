<Content>(Too) Close to the airport The hotel B盲rlin is evocative of the Kennedy era, which was coincidentally also the last time any room in this hotel was aired. The stench of cheap air freshener throughout the hotel is sickening. The only thing that distracts you from this and the state-of-the-art 7鈥?TV is the rapid sequence of airplanes during final approach right above the hotel鈥檚 roof. This is due to the advantageous position of the hotel right at the end of a runway at Berlin-Tegel airport. Unfortunately, the airport shuts down at midnight, so the sound of airplane turbines will no longer drown out the sound of ambulance and police sirens racing by. Once one closes the window to (slightly) muffle the cacophony, one becomes painfully aware of the odor emitted by the room, which can only be described as sweaty old man walks wet dog. As soon as the windows are shut the room temperature quickly increases from unpleasant to roasting.
