<Content>Loved this hotel What a lovely boutique hotel in one of the best neighborhoods in Paris! My husband and I were celebrating our 25th anniversary and the staff treated us like royalty. They included complimentary breakfasts for us for two nights and were extremely accomodating for all of our needs.The rooms are a bit small but comfortable and quiet even though this is a very busy area at night. They are so many cafes and great little boutiques for shopping nearby. I would highly recommend this hotel if you want to be in a great area and looking for a hotel with very personalized service. A great value!

<Content>I wouldn't stay anywhere else!! A lovely hotel in an excellent area of Paris. Walk out and takebreakfast in Pauls Bakery opposite(don't pay the hotels breakfast price!) then turn left or right and you have restaurants, bars, shops galore on your doorstep.Rue de Buci is a narrow road just off Boulevard St Germain and is in what feels like an upmarket area. Our room on the top floor had a view of Notre Dame (if you opened the window!) and proved to be warm, comfortable and we heard very little noise from the busy street below.Notre Dame and the Louvre are a 10 minute walk away and you have 3 metro stations within a 3 minute walk.Room was well appointed, very clean if a little small.We arrived late and the night porter was a little unwelcoming but otherwise staff were good.We very much enjoyed being able to walk out , have a good meal, take in the atmosphere and wander back to the hotel without the need for metro/taxi/bus ect........will be back!

<Content>Awesome location My wife and I stayed here in Sept. Having never been to Europe, a lot of research was done trying to find the hotel and location that would meet our expectations. If you are looking to stay close to attractions and shopping, this spot can't be beat. I was looking for something close to the action yet also in an area that had tiny narrow streets and many cafes and restaurants. That's exactly where this hotel is located. Some of my most enjoyable moments were getting up in the morning and going across the street to the tiny bakery for coffee and bagels and to watch the area come alive in the morning. Just a block or so away is Le Procope, Paris' oldest restaurant. We stumbled on it and were extremely pleased with the ambience, history and food. Unless you're getting the superior room at Le Buci, be prepared to pretty much have to move your suitcase to get out of the room. We upgraded to a superior room, it was well worth it. The young fellow taking care of breakfast in the mornings was very helpful with direction or anything else we needed. Excellent place to stay. Would personally not find a reason to gamble on another hotel the next time. It will be Hotel Le Buci.

<Content>Fine but uninspiring Hotel de Buci is in a FANTASTIC location -- great access to Metro, RER trains and lots of the places you want to be -- and is a competent hotel. Superior room was larger than expected. All else is fine but not noteworthy; expect competent room, competent staff -- but nothing special - and you will not be disappointed.

<Content>A wonderful hotel and location I took my 16 yr. old granddaughter to Paris for the first time the end of June. My daughter (her aunt) and husband also joined us. Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful; cafes were on the corner for breakfast/dinner. Neighborhood itself is wonderful and easily accessible to museums and the major Paris attractions.

<Content>Loved the hotel, but not great climate control for summer Great location, and great staff. Free internet, and lovely room in the basement. My biggest complaints are that when we were there, the english language channels on TV were not working. Also the weather was extremely hot, and air conditioning in the room was not up to the task. Would stay there again in cooler weather, but not in the very hot weather.

<Content>A little gem We were sorry to leave Hotel de Buci. It is an absolute gem of a hotel, and we really loved it. You get a good impression as you walk through the door, the staff are very friendly and helpful and our room, which was on the 2nd floor and overlooked the street, was very prettily furnished and spotlessly clean. The bathroom was also very clean and quite well equipped. Although the hotel is set in a bustling area, there was no noise or intrusive light in the room while sleeping, due to the electric blinds which cover the windows outside at night. Not many people seemed to take breakfast (others have reported here that it was a bit pricey) but we enjoyed it each day with part waiter service. The hotel setting in the St Germain des Pres area is amid a wonderful interesting mxture of little art galleries, shops and cafes - we were only a few minutes from the metro, and could easily walk to the Louvre, Notre Dame etc. Congratulations to all who work to make this such a lovely hotel, this was our fifth visit to the city, and this is the nicest Paris hotel we have stayed in by far. We look forward to returning soon.

<Content>Romantic Getaway Have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Hotel De Buci in Paris. My boyfriend booked the accommodation, and I couldn't have asked for anywhere better.We stayed for 3 nights over the Easter weekend, our room was on the third floor at the front of the hotel. Although the room was a bit on the small side, this wasn't a problem. It was nicely decorated in a French boudior style, it had all the amenities you would expect ie, flatscreen tv (with some English channels), hairdryer, minibar. The bathroom had a shower in the bath, and was slightly awkward, as you had to hold the shower head yourself, but this was only a minor inconvenience.We had breakfast included in our deal, which was the usual continental breakfast, it was always very quiet in the breakfast area and we often had it to ourselves!The location of the hotel was excellent, situated in the St Germain De Pres district, we were within walking distance of the Lourve, River Seine, Notre Dame. The nearest Metro station was only a 5 minute walk, and we found it very easy to use and a reasonable price. I would throughly recommend the Hotel De Buci, if you're looking for a chic boutique hotel in a great location, this could be the one for you.

<Content>Just right! First off, I should say that this was my fifth visit to Paris, and my first visit exclusively for pleasure. My past visits were arranged by production companies, so I had little choice over where I stayed. Each earlier visit to Paris had me staying in a tiny hotel room with ancient amenities. I came to realize that tiny hotel rooms are the standard in Paris. Hotel de Buci is no exception. The difference here is that they utilize every inch of space well, and the amenities are clean and modern.The main reason to stay here is the location- right in the heart of chic Germain St. Dupres. Hotel de Buci is set on a busy street lined with real Parisian restaurants (not the ones designed for tourists). Yet despite being on a busy street, the noise doesn't reach your bedroom. The weekend of my visit, we learned there was a metro strike. All the public bicycles were reserved by locals to commute to and from work. No problem -- our hotel was a comfortable walk away from Notre Dame, The Louvre, and the Eiffel Tour. By the time we got the major attractions out of the way, the strike let up and we were able to use the metro to see other areas of Paris.Another reason to stay at Hotel de Buci: the lovely host Charlotte! Upon your arrival, she will do her best to make you feel welcome. If you have a particular destination you'd like to see, Charlotte will point it out on a map and look up the hours for you. One suggestion: Breakfast is pricey, and not included in the rate. As an alternative - Wake up early in the AM, run across the street to the boulangerie, and pick up some freshly baked bread and coffee. C'est bon!

<Content>Fell in Love 17 Times Hotel De Buci was the best hotel and really inexpensive for the area. Near the Notre Dame, my girlfriend and I had the best time. The location was awesome and staff were very friendly and helpful. The view, location, price, and romantic atomsphere make this a great place to stay while Paris. Booked through Eurostar and got a wonderful deal.

<Content>Great location, fantastic value After reading some of the reviews of the Buci, particularly regarding their service, I was a little apprehensive in booking it. However the location was perfect and I decided to chance it. It turned out to be the best hotel of our trip. Not only was the location as perfect as I expected, the service was also great. The staff assisted us with all our enquiries and even gave us a fabulous restaurant recommendation. The room was Parisianly compact, but comfortable and modern and we even had a glimpse of Notre Dame from the top floor. We have been to Paris 4 times and always stayed in the same area but never the same hotel twice. This time we found a hotel that we will return to.

<Content>nice place Hotel De Buci is in a fantastic location in the Saint Germaine area right in the middle of shops and cafes.The service I received was fantastic. Nothing was too much for the staff. The only draw back is the size of the room, I asked for the larger room. I opened the door and fell into the bed. As I am from Australia I was not use to this and was quite shocked at the size of the room I think my closet at home is bigger. But in saying this the hotel itself was great.

<Content>Very very good A small personal 4 star hotel (assume family owned - it seemed like it). Clean and very tasteful decor and trimmings. Staff were extremelyhelpful and attentive. Room was ok in size but might be a bit small for some staying many nights. Room is well appointed though and bed extremely comfy (and I am fussy). A good simple breakfast in a lovelylounge-type room was a good way start the day. Best of all though is the fab location on a side street just off the Boulevard St Germain. Loads of atmospherica bars and restaurant, shops and eateries surround and the whole atmosphere is one of what you expect Paris to be like - wonderful. Cost of 拢120 per night for the room was very good value for this hotel. Without doubt would have no hesitation in staying here again.

<Content>Great location, decent hotel My husband and I stayed at Hotel De Buci for one night in October 2007. We were in Paris for an extended stay at another hotel earlier in the month and chose the De Buci for our last night of the trip because of its superb location, in the heart of St. Germain surrounded by shops and cafes. Maybe it was our room or that we prefer modern as opposed to traditional French decor, but the experience wasn't four star--except for the robe and slippers. For example, the bed was incredibly uncomfortable with the mattress sagging so much in the middle that my husband ended up sleeping on the floor. We twice asked for another set of towels--only one was provided in the bathroom--and never received it (another request was answered right away). On the plus side, the room was clean and quiet with wi-fi and CNN and most staff appeared helpful. Overall, it's a decent hotel with an amazing location--just not worth $300 for us but maybe for others.

<Content>Great location, delightful staff I just stayed at the Hotel de Buci in September. I was really struck by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. They really made the stay exceptional. The location is perfect, although the price is high. The room was pretty and comfortable (though small) and many small details were taken care of. Our room overlooked a fairly unattractive courtyard, but since it was quiet we had no complaints about that. At all times of day and night, you can walk out of the hotel  be in the thick of St. Germain action! I would return to this hotel. (By the way, don't count on getting a taxi from this neighborhood during busy periods. Give yourself a lot of time or make alternative arrangements)

<Content>Loved the Hotel De Buci I don't know how anyone could write a negative review of this jewel of a hotel. We loved the location, the room, the view of Rue de Buci. The decor was very French antique, but also had a flat screen TV. There was access to the internet downstairs in the room adjacent to the breakfast room. BUT most of all the staff and manager Catherine Mollier were wonderful, very polite and helpful but also very friendly and warm. We would never consider staying anywhere else. This is truly the best experience we've ever had. Our daughter even got to try out her French, but the staff was also very accepting of our English speaking and they spoke many languages beautifully.Levittown, New York

<Content>Great location, shame about the staff First the positives - the location IS unbeatable. In the heart of St Germain it is two spits from the coolest people watching bar (Bar du Marche) in Paris (and therefore surely the World) plus countless other restaurants and bars, 3 mins from the Seine and 10 from the Louvre. Now to the negatives, unfortunately... The reviews commenting on the rude staff (at least the night-time staff) are oh so true. To cut a very long story short, the smallest request (to turn a double into a twin, as we had booked and as the day staff (who were very professional) had promised would be done was met with eye rolling, huffs and puffs, truculence, downright arguing and (no kidding) a quilt being thrown across the (very small) room in rage (after I came in and found the 'twin' beds were 2cms apart and shared a quilt and dared to say oh, could we please have separate quilts since we won't be sharing a bed at all). After this I complained to the night-time manager who simply made excuses for the staff member concerned and attributed blame to us. His attitude wasn't altogether surprising since when, the next morning, when we asked him to book us a cab, we got similar eye-rolling and huffs.Of lesser impact on our break but things to bear in mind: (a) yes the rooms are very small (although you should accept that you'll find that throughout Europe) and looked out on a courtyard and the air-conditioner; (b) for a period in the evening the room stank of smoke - maybe from the next room or maybe from the dour (cleaning?) woman who skulked around the lobby smoking constantly) and (c) the bathroom door didn't lock or close properly.I'd agree with other reviewers who expressed surprise that this is a 4*. Stay here if location is important and a little Gallic attitude will add to your trip to Paris, but come prepared...pack your boxing gloves!

<Content>Fantastic hotel in a superb location I stayed here recently for several nights. Wow. This hotel was fantastic in a superb location. A bit pricey but then so are all hotels in Paris.Paid 215 Euros for a double room [it was for one person].The location of this hotel on the Rue de Buci in the heart of Saint Germain cannot be beaten. The hotel is quiet yet you step out the front door of the hotel and you are in the middle of all the action. There are cafes galore and fabulous restaurants within walking distance. I requested a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the courtyard and it was extremely quiet - no noise at all and I slept like a baby. My only gripe is the hotel rules [never verbally pointed out but located in written material in the hotel room - you can always say you never saw it!] which state that you are not allowed outside food in the room. I thought this demand was outrageous and just ignored it and had cornflakes in my room every day for breakfast rather than pay 22 Euros for the hotel breakfast. My attitude is if I am paying 215 Euros a night I will eat whatever I please in my room! In my opinion this little rule of the hotel's should be removed from the hotel rule book. On the other hand quite often I would walk into the hotel with grocery bags and staff saw it and said nothing so maybe it's one of those rules that's meant to be broken?Staff at this hotel are incredibly helpful and wonderful. There is a big Champion supermarket 10 metres from the hotel and a superb fruit stall selling top quality fruit right across the street. I liked the Hotel Buci and would highly recommend it.

<Content>The Quintessential Paris Experience We booked this hotel quite by accident, thinking it another. What a great mistake! My first time in Paris and I couldn't have wished for a better place to stay. Although the rooms are small. They are immaculate and cute. Bathrooms are modern. I stayed in 62 on the top floor over looking the street. FABULOUS! With a window balcony and view of NotreDame and the bustling street life below. I will do many paintings from views snapped from this room. Also the sound proofing blocked out the street and there was never noise from ajoining rooms. The location was amazing. Close to Cafes, shops Poulin Bakery (a MUST) and sidewalk cafes were open late so you never feel rushed. Metro a very easy few minutes walk away. The down side? Only the price. And do insist on on a street room as there is NO view at all on the courtyard room except into the apartments across the way. The bilingual staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. I will most certainly stay there on my next visit.

<Content>Hmmmm - maybe its just the Aussie Peso! Well there is no doubt this hotel is located in a very cool part of Paris. Its hard not to part with plenty of Euros sitting in the sidewalk cafes with a drink watching the world go by. There are a number of great restaurants nearby and getting around to the rest of the sights in the city is easy. After an excellent introduction by the exceptionally helpful front desk staff the hotel was a bit disappointing. Our room was located on the first floor above the street, which was great to see things from, but to get a decent nights sleep, we had to close the windows and the electric steel shutters, and rely on the airconditioning. It didnt help that on the second day the remote for the air con disappeared after the room was serviced.  Other negatives for us included:- Hard beds and two single beds pushed together. This seems to be common in Europe however, in the city of love - it is a bit annoyin to spend the night sleeping in the gap!- Small shower and small roomOverall we wouldnt stay here again and thought it was over priced, although as Australians our dollar doesnt go far in Paris.

<Content>great hotel This hotel is located in the heart of 'fun area' of St Germain de Pres on the Left Bank. It is surrounded by cafes, restaurants and bars catering to all tastes and pockets.The hotel staff are friendly, efficient, attentive and multi-lingual. The rooms are small, as they are in all the hotels in this district ( the buildings are very old!). Apart from that they are spotless and well appointed. We have stayed in Paris many times and have tried various hotels and this is the best one that we have experienced in this district. We will stay there again.

<Content>Very impressed with Hotel De Buci Very impressed, paid a bit more per night that ideally I wanted too but as it turned out it was worth every penny. Location is perfect - Louvre within walking distance, metro near by etc etc. Hotel itself excellent, well presented, staff bright and cheerful, room well equipped and up to the 4 stars the hotel identifies itself as.Will stay there again for sure.

<Content>Tourist Exploitation I went there for three days along with my fiance and I can honestly say that the hotel was quite a disappointment. Although the location is good, the rooms are very small and the one we stayed in had a horrible view with average decoration. Except from that, the main disadvatage of hotel de Buci is that it is expensive without offering a good value -if any-for the money it asks for. We paid around 250 euros per night for the room we stayed in without even having the breakfast included. Breakfast was served in a room below ground and seemed suffocating. Finally the lady in the reception hall that seems to be in charge of the guests is very unpolite and should perhaps take some hospitality courses before being assigned to the position that she is. All other employees were professional.

<Content>Not first reccomendation I spend a weekend at this hotel and I wouldn't recommend it as a first choice. It is not a bad place but it is higly overrated and overpriced. I stayed in a tiny room (category superior!!) overooking an awful courtyard. The room didn't have any personality and a huge ugly semi-column was covering 1/3 of the free space. The management had a clear speculative policy towards the guests.The rate for this room was higher than most expensive rooms of the best hotels in the prettiest street of Saint Germain Rue Jacob. They had price listings for second-class  hand De Buci umbrellas and bath towels for more than 60 euros each. Most of the stuff were really professionals and very efficient in their duties except the daytime woman receptionist - she was really unfriedly and unpolite. It is really strange that this property has a 4-star rating. The rooms are very standard and the decors of the best 3-star hotels in Saint Germain are much more impressive. I don't think is a coincidence that in their website do not have clear images of their accomodation and surroundings.

<Content>Perfection in a small boutique hotel The Hotel Buci is in the perfect situation, in the centre of the Latin Quarter. It is perefctly decorated with manificent art work etc. It is extremely comfortable. The breakfasts are wondrous. The staff are wonderfully helpful and friendly. The bar is a divine art deco bar looking directly out onto the Rue Buci and all the charm and characters of the Latin Quarter. It's four star so it isn't a budget hotel, but if you can afford 4 star rates (and they are quite reasonable) - don't pas this hotel by. It's quite perfect. As if Lila the hotel doggie.

<Content>Return again and again My husband and I have stayed at de Buci on numerous occassions over the past four years. We have yet to be disappointed. The location is fabulous and each time we venture away and try a hotel in a different part of Paris we regret our decision. The more you get to know this area, the more you will fall in love with Paris. The hotel is small but most of the rooms are more than adequate (by Parisian standards). I think we stayed on the top floor one time and the room was tiny but this is the only time we have been slightly disappointed. The service is always efficient and friendly. The rooms are clean and exceptionally quiet given the bustling location. Some rooms back onto a shabby looking courtyard - but then, the courtyard itself is typically Parisian. However, the rooms overlooking the street are nicer. The room service breakfast is great - beautiful crisp linen tablecloth and napkins - but it is a little pricey. A good option is to save your money and go out for breakfast at one of the cafes on Rue de Buci. Definitely our favourite Paris hotel. The location and the sound-proof, clean rooms justify the price.

<Content>Great small hotel My husband and I stayed here for seven nights over Christmas, 2005, and found the hotel delightful. We had last stayed at George V, and while Hotel Buci cannot compare to the services and ambiance of that hotel, the suite we stayed in cost less than half what we paid at George V. We stayed in the Toile de Jouy suite, which had been two separate small rooms that were combined to form a suite. Each room had its own bathroom, one with full bath and one with shower only. The small salon had a double size, pull-down murphy bed, a small round table and three chairs as well as two long windows facing the delightful street and market. The bedroom had a beautiful bed, desk and dresser and a reasonably sized closet, along with two large windows facing the street. The yellow and navy toile fabrics covering everything were beautiful. My only complaint was that despite numerous lamps, the lighting was extremely dim because the lampshades were all lined in gold foil. I had to take the lampshades off any time I wanted to read. The front desk employee during the day was a delightful Egyptian named Dorani Atef, and he could not have been nicer or more fun. The manager/owner, Frederick LaSalle, is much more reserved, although very polite. And Lily, the shnauzer that acts as the official greeter, adds a great deal of warmth to the experience of staying in this delighful hotel. The neighborhood is fabulous. We have visited Paris many times in the past decade, and we will definitely return to this wonderful hotel.

<Content>Lovely decor I stayed one night at this hotel in October because my original reservation at another hotel in the area was made for the wrong dates. The hotel staff was most accommodating. The room was extremely small, but the decor and amenities were lovely. There was barely enough room for luggage for one person, and I wonder how two people would have coped in the same space. Nevertheless, the room was very well done, the bathroom, although tiny, had first rate soaps, lotions, etc. The location is ideal, and the staff very attentive.

<Content>highly recommended The perfect location amid the bustle of St Germain.We had a clean, well appointed room overlooking the lively street. A comfortable lobby lounge.The service was impeccable yet friendly, not at all stuffy. WiFi throughout the hotel (though not free)And what could be better than an affectionate Lily the shnauzer greeting you each time you return.

<Content>Fabulous, the best! Before our trip to Paris in late August, I reserched every hotel you could imagine. We chose Hotel De Buci and could not have been happier with with the decision. This hotel is located on the left bank, just off Dauphine and Ste Germaine aves. It is surrounded by great shops and restuarants with very reasonable prices. It's located within a short walk to most museums and gardens and very close to 2 underground stops. We had a room facing De Buci, the room had large windows that opened to the street, they were double paned so when we wanted quiet, we had it. When we wanted the sounds of Paris in, we just opened the windows. The room was large and had a beautiful bathroom with upgraded ammenities, they offer twice a day turndownso everything is always fresh and clean. The overall service was absolutely excellent. It is warm and friendly, has a great location and reasonably priced for a hotel of this quality. Be sure to meet Lily she is the mascot dog who is willing to greet you at all hours. When we arrived it was raining, the bellman, actually saw the shuttle pull up and came to meet us with an umbrella. I highly reccomend you stay at The De Buci if you are looking for something wonderful. We can't wait to return.

<Content>Buci, the Best Stayed at the Buci the first week of July, 2004. What a great experience. The staff was warm, helpful, and went out of their way to assist us. Mr. LaSalle has done a fantastic job with the help of his trusty sidekick, Leila the lobby dog.

<Content>Absolutely Terrific My wife and I stayed for a week at the Hotel Buci for our honeymoon and it was absolutely fantastic! The front desk employees went out of their way to help us plan our days and our meals. The cleaning was regular and thorough. The location cannot be beat among the lively cafes of St. Germain-des-Pres. I can't think of one thing I would change - even the smallish rooms were more than adequate - you shouldn't spend time in the rooms in Paris anyway. The best part, however, was the little dog that acts as doorman and concierge at all hours and makes it seem more like a home than a hotel. Highly recommended!!!!!
