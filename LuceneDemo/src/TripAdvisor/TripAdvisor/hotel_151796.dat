<Content>Great Getaway I was with my loved one and his first time out of the main land. After having a horrible experience with a hotel in san juan, I decided to go where I am comfortable (West Coast). Hotel made immediate accomedations for us, which was great. Hospitality was great, poolside very clean, breakfast complimentary, casino very pleasant. Convenient to airport; u must rent a vehicle if you want to experience the beaches and many tourist attractions. *****TOURIST ATTRACTIONS ARE NOT ONLY IN SAN JUAN*****

<Content>Fairly nice; and decent price Stayed there for 10 days on a business trip in september 07. Got a quiet room with some view over the sea (a bit far, but still...), which I recommend since the main road is particularly noisy. Room was fairly large, clean, with free internet access -somewhat unstable though. Bathroom was well equipped and clean as well. The bed was not really comfortable, though. Staff was polite and willing to help, at least for check-in. Breakfast was served on the ground floor since the lounge upstairs was being refurbished; and was disappointing. The restaurant has reasonable price; however the quality is so-so, and got sick one day after eating fish. Finally, the pool is nice as well; and access is free. Overall, considering the reasonable price, this hotel is an option to be considered.

<Content>Typical Holiday Inn, but with better coffee! This hotel is not on the beach, although you can see the ocean from some of the rooms. The room I had was clean and the bed was comfortable. The restaurant food was also relatively inexpensive for a Holiday Inn. I can鈥檛 comment much about the casino as I don鈥檛 gamble, except to say that it looked like the casino was more of a hit with the locals than the hotel guests. I didn鈥檛 use the pool so I can鈥檛 comment on that. The wireless was free, but in my room it was fairly weak and would drop on occasion. The hotel represented a good value for the money.

<Content>Disappointed While staying in Mayaguez, my parents decided to treat themselves to Christmas dinner at the restaurant attachted to the hotel. Their whole party (6) was extremely disappointed at the quality of the over priced meal.

<Content>They held my Express mail package for 3 days! I was expecting an Express Mail package. For three days I asked the front desk if they received my package and the answer was, no package. We'll call you when it arrives.After tradking the package I discovered it was there for the past 3 days! Way to go guys.Sitting by the by the pool was great for about 30 minutes. Than the giant speakers came out and it sounded like I was at a block party just broke out. So much for reading the paper and relaxing by the pool..Not everything was awful at the hotel. The brakfast was good and the coffee was great.

<Content>Not bad, but not great either This is an atypical Holiday Inn, but with a casino. I have to agree with another review that it is odd that guests park off to the side where there is little light and you have to walk further to the hotel. I guess they must make more money off the casino than guests. The pool was ok, the room was clean, but the air conditioner barely worked. All in all it was a place to rest and play a little.

<Content>Older crowd The rooms were okay, but not for the price you pay. The pool and restaurants were nice. The view of mountain tops was a plus. The club closes at 2am, and nothing but 40+ dancing salsa. Casino was okay but thought it was too small. Never order a long island ice tea there. Stick with one liquor drinks. It is a relaxing place to stay but want to wait for a special.

<Content>Tough to sleep This Holiday Inn needs to decide whether it is in the Entertainment or the Hospitality business. Our room was two floors above the discoteque and we could not sleep above the loud booming discoteque music that booms through the building.At the price I paid for our vacation, including airfare, I just wanted a good night's sleep. Instead, I received the nagging sound of booming bass music and had interrupted sleep from 9P-305A. This was 6 hours I wouldn't want anyone to go through.

<Content>Home away from home Staying at the Holiday Inn in Mayaquez was a wonderful experience. It felt like home. Rooms were excellent. Staff were friendly, food was wonderful, and entertainment was great. For those who love to dance, its available every weekend. Casino is open twenty four hours. The Mayaquez town is ten minutes from the hotel. If suba diving is your thing, the town of Rincon is fifteen or twenty minutes away. The historic town of San German where the oldest church known as Porta Coeli was built in 1606 is about forty five minutes from the hotel. Sea loving community is in Cabo Rojo is about thirty or forty minutes away, you'll find beach towns in La parquera, El Combate and boqueron. Experience the other side of the Island. It's possible if you stay at the Holiday Inn. I personally loved it.
