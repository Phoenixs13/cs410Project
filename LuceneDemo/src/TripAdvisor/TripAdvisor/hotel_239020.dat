<Content>Good location! Stayed in the cozy double room. Not actually that small and perfect for our stay. Weird that we had to leave our room key and housekeeping was a bit noisy but if I had to do it again, I would. Very good location - just minutes from many restaurants and shopping.

<Content>Rat/mouse in the room! I was at Hotel De Paris Amsterdan from 12th to 15th Oct and a rat/mouse appeared in the room I shared with a friend in 14h during the night.  The animal gnawed a bar of Lindt chocolate and slices of orange covered by chocolate that my friend had bought in Lisbon. We called the man at the Reception, but he didn麓t go at our room to help us with the rat/mouse.  As we went to the Recepction and refused to go back to the bedroom, he offered us another bedroom and help us taking ours bags and suitcases from de rat/mouse's bedroom. The hotel refund 12 euros for the chocolates but didn麓t apologize for the trouble. On the contrary, on morning after the rat attack, the recepcionist said we are acting like children and threatened to call the police if we didn't left the room - it's was 12:10 and we are supposed to do the check out at 12:00, but as we left the other room quickly during the night our bags and suitcases were in a mess and we were late. The man were sarcastic about my country and said that in Brazil didn't have mouses, but big rats. In 13th Oct, Christina Wiklund commented on the Hotels.nl site that there were rat/mouse in her bedroom too(http://www.hotels.nl/amsterdam/deparis/ see the first comment).

<Content>Good hotel, excellent location I stayed 5 nights at this hotel on my first (and not last) visit to Amsterdam in early July of 2008. I am familiar with hotel accommodations in Britain and Europe, and can only presume that other reviewers who complained about the small size of the rooms are not used to travelling in this part of the world. Large, North American style rooms may be available in Europe, but you have to stay at large, North American style hotels (eg. Hilton) and can expect to pay a lot more.I liked the full, hot buffet breakfast that is included in the room rental and also found the location to be perfect - only a few minutes walk from the Leidesplein and also within walking distance of Centraal Station, the Damrak and of course, the famous Red Light District. And if you don't feel like walking, there's a bus/tram stop in front of the hotel.

<Content>liked this hotel a lot. The boyfriend and I booked a last minute, reasonably priced deal from a website and were pleased with the room. It was larger than I expected - after staying in several Amsterdam hotels you tend to expect to sleep in tiny box rooms and you could actually walk round this room in the hotel which was pleasing. It also had a safe which I appreciated.One major benefit was the fact we had a balcony overlooking the street which we were on - this was not expected and not asked for and so we felt priviledged. Another major thing was that we turned up four hours before check-in time, expecting to leave our luggage in a little room. However the gentlemen behind the desk asked us to wait five minutes and got our room ready for us which was unbelievably nice, again making us feel very priviledged indeed.The bed (two pushed together to make a double - not the end of the world) was comfy and clean, the room was a smoking one but didn't smell of smoke or have burns everywhere... overall we were pleased.A few negatives - the shower looked old and limescaled and the tray clogged up when we used it, however the actual shower was powerful and hot and did the job. I suppose the cleanliness of the shower was an issue but neither of us died from it so I can't complain really. The sink also leaked when used but that was nothing a towel, put underneath to catch the drips, didn't solve. The taps still worked so it didn't bother us. The only other negative was that the cleaners left a lot of their sheets and whatnot in the hallways, but this was not a major issue. None of the cleaners barged in on us like they have done at other hotels; instead they put a useful to be cleaned sign on the door.As for the rest - great elevator (looked new), stairs weren't as bad as I've experienced before, staff were extremely helpful and friendly, no curfew, all-hour bar, decor quirky and i liked it.Overall the hotel was great. I admit the negative aspects of the shower and sink were a bit disheartening but they were easily overlooked by all the positives of the hotel - i.e. the elevator, balcony in the room, the brilliant location of the hotel, and the lovely staff. There is also a bustling bar and a coffeeshop directly opposite the hotel which was great for people like me and the boyf.

<Content>Tiny room with renewal made 20 years ago, but good price I have spent 2 nights in this hotel with my husband in small double room for a price of (218 euro + city tax 5%) total. The price was good for us, the place is really good, but the room is something... It is of size of a bathroom, the double bed is in its corner is not double but for 1.5 persons I think, so we had to sleep in a hug :). So the width of a room was bed width + maybe 50 cm. The length of the room was bed length + 50-70cm (only for little wardrobe). The wall paper was breaking away from the wall so it seemed no renewal was made for ages! Plastic windows were so old and fixed with iron angles, so they were not hermetic for air and noise, that is quite important when window is to the street side with running trams. But we had so intensive days that we slept like dead. Breakfast was standard. If you don't mind super tiny rooms without remont, but need to economy your money, this can be an option, cause you get hotel in city center, a private room with toilet and shower plus breakfast. Plus I saw more expensive rooms - they seem better, cause not so tiny.

<Content>Basic Hotel, Fine Experience I stayed in Amsterdam recently, and we found a good deal at the Hotel de Paris. We stayed there for a few days, and it was a perfectly fine hotel. Nothing fancy, but it was a clean and well-priced place to stay. Here are some pros and cons of the hotel:PROS:--If you want to be in the Leidesplein area, it is a great location. About a 3 minute walk from the Leidseplein (which is full of restaurants and shops). It is about a 10 minute walk to the Rijksmuseum and a 20 minute walk to the Red Light District.--The hotel is on a fairly quiet street, so you won't get rowdy people outside the hotel--You have to be buzzed into the hotel, so it felt safe. There was also a person on duty 24 hours a day--There is a full breakfast each morning, which is very good.--The lobby is small, but has some sofas and places to relax--The rooms are basic but very clean. The beds were comfortable.CONS:--The hotel rooms are *very* small, as are the bathrooms.--The furniture is very basic and there is only a tiny TV on the wall--The doors are VERY thin, so you can hear people in the hallways--The rooms and hallways often smell like smoke (after all, it is Amsterdam)--The stairs are ridiculously narrow and steep (but there is an elevator).--Note that you may end up in a basement room! The stairs are really dangerous, and you can see into the basement rooms from the street. Try to avoid these rooms.Overall, the Hotel de Paris was a fine place to stay for a few days. Hope that helps!

<Author>DB880
<Content>reminded me of my 8x10' dorm room I knew I was getting a cheap hotel, but for the price I paid (about $185/night for standard room) it should have been a lot better. The room actually felt smaller than my 8x10 dorm room if that's possible. It had two twin beds pushed together and a desk and there was no room to walk in between the beds (or on the other sides of them) nor was there more than a foot in between the beds and the desk. I literally jumped to get in my bed. Hot water really only happened late in the day or at night, so hot showers in the morning didn't happen. The bathtub and the bathroom sink were both clogged. And the maids woke us up if we were still asleep past 9:30-10pm. She'd give one knock and then already be in the room and when we said come back later she insisted on emptying the trash cans and dropping off towels (onto the bed I was sleeping in) anyway. Wouldn't stay here again that's for sure. The only pro is that it's walkable to everything.

<Content>Ok, for the price I suppose As this hotel stay cost very little for 2 nights BB (about 140 each) I shouldnt really moan but if you are looking for a stay in a nice, classy hotel the Hotel de Paris is somewhere I wouldnt really recommend! The staff are not very friendly at all and the rooms are similar to those found in a ship cabin. As i generally found the city a bit uncomfortable I think this made the hotel seem worse than it actually was. The breakfast was quite limited and not the freshest and the staff were keen to get you out of the way and tidy up.On the plus side the hotel is in a very good central locationAll in all I dont think I would go back to Amsterdam and if I did i would be trying a different hotelAs previously stated though, it was cheap so what can you expect?

<Content>Good Location / Bad Room I was here for two nights and can confirm that even two years ago this place was not good, and I am a young guy who dosen't mind shabbiness. The location is grat your right in the middle of the square and you also have the tram closely located. However it seemed like a room out of an old 70's sitcom. If your in a bind this place will do, but if you got options go with the others.

<Content>health and safety hazard! We had booked into this hotel only to find the entire downstairs carpet being reffitted and were asked to go to the check in desk whilst workmen were moving the floor covering. Then to find a room the size of a postage stamp, customer service with an expressed anger towards the clients (APALLlING buisiness model) Hope thats clear enough, one step up from sleeping on broken glass.

<Content>Submarine-size quarters I rented a 'single' room. I could stand in the room and almost touch both walls with my fingertips, No exageration! ( I'm 5ft 5in) The head of the bed was against wall streetside, and next to an airconditioner. Noise and the drip drip drip of AC was like Chinese torture. Manager was unable to relocate me.The couple travelling with me had a larger room and thought it was 'okay'. I chose it because it was inexpensive and close to Leidseplein.Beware! Avoid the 'single bed rooms.

<Content>Avoid this "hotel" Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights......... the room we were given was miniscule. It was up in the attic area and was very warm and stuffy. We had to keep the windows open at night and the noise from the trams and the bar across the street was very annoying.The pictures posted by the hotel of their bedrooms on the website bore no ressemblance whatsoever to the room we were given. I believe our room wasnt cleaned once during the duration of our stay.......... then again it would have been hard to get a hoover in the room to do any cleaning. The only upside of the room was the ensuite..... it appeared to be recently revamped and the shower was good.Breakfast was adequate.... nothing to rave about.This hotel is in an ideal location but then so are many more hotels around the vicinity. If I had read the reviews on here before booking this hotel I would have avoided it like the plague.I would definetly say this hotel is one to avoid at all cost. If it were possible I would give this one a minus rating of -5.0.

<Content>Not worth the money I often laugh at some of the reviews calling rooms in Europe small because compared to American standards, they often are. Well, this defied all standards of small. We could open one suitcase at a time, and if a suitcase was open on the floor, you could not get in (or out) of the bathroom because you were blocking the door. My family was in the same hotel, and their rooms were not as bad, but for what we got, we definitely paid too much. The fire alarm also went off in the middle of the night because, apparently, someone was taking a shower with the door open and the steam set it off. My advice: keep looking.

<Content>Good location - Average hotel for the price Just got back from three nights at the Hotel de Paris. The location of the hotel is great with the Leidesplein and tram stops literally a two minute walk away.As far as the hotel goes the reception/breakfast area was rather old fashioned in decor, however the bedroom had been refurbished and modern. Bed was comfortable. It was air conditioned which was also a plus point. The bathroom was also ok and had a decent shower. Only downside was that breakfast was pretty average.Price was probably a bit steep but no worse than anywhere else in the city.

<Content>a great stay may 11th to 14th I stayed there with my partner and friends of ours it was ok for what we payed. It was only 2mins from Liedsplien sq, where the tram stopped just down on the right. We were there to sleep, shower and get ready for the night ahead. The breakfast was basic, the staff were'nt that bad. You could'nt take the hotel key with you, it had to be left behind reception. they did have someone on the desk 24hrs, so when you came in day or night you had to buzz, which was good because no strangers were aloud in. the tram from the station to Liedsplien was the no5 and took about 10mins. You could walk to most places if you wanted or get the tram, which was about 1.50 euros. The city of Amsterdam was great. We all said we would stay there again. So do'nt believe every thing you read, just go and have fun.

<Content>The worst hotel ever This is THE WORST hotel I have ever stayed in. And I cannot understand how can ANY agency offer this dirty pigeon hole. I am sorry that I have recently deleted photos of this anti-hotel which is not worth 1 euro, And on top of that, the staff is unfriendly, pretends not to understand English when ou complain and they are not willing to help at all. My opinion share other 8 people who stayed in this hole.I regret each cent I have spent there. And it is not in centre ! It is in the street where you can feel every little car passing by.

<Content>(from uk) not that bad, good coffee shop across the road me and a friend stayed at this hotel for 4 days, the hotel was very basic with a not so helpful manager. the lift was prehistoric and took me 5 mins to work out how to open the door. nearly broke my neck walking down the stairs but honestly we only used the hotel to sleep and wash.. amsterdam is for sight-seeing.... and tasting... if you know what i mean. ps... there is a good coffee shop right across the road.

<Content>pretty good We stayed at the hotel for three nights, and I guess it just depends on how much you paid for this hotel. When I stayed I paid a little less than 100 dollars per night, which I think is pretty good for amsterdam. The reason they classify this hotel as a three star hotel is probably the location, because the hotel itself is nothing special. Location was perfect for me, and I actually enjoyed walking to most places where the attractions are. Also, it was a nice relief to get away from an American style hotel. This hotel was smaller and I liked that aspect of it. Yes, the stairs are steep especially if you are carrying luggage, but unless you have a disability, or are really old, you should be ok. I actually liked the stairs, they were different! I like different!The rooms are very basic. We had two beds put together and that was ok by me. The beds were comfortable enough, and I really didn't hear any outside noise. The bathrooms were perfectly fine as well. The front desk person was always extremely friendly. I didn't catch his name, but he was an older gentleman that always smiled.If you get a good deal, I would highly recommend this hotel. If you can't find anything around 100 dollars or less, I might try another hotel.

<Content>not good The staff were friendly and efficient... and that's about the only good thing I can think of.The stairs are frighteningly steep, there's an unpleasant odour in the hallways, the breakfast is limited even by continental standards.And the room is the smallest room I have ever stayed in. There was barely room to turn around. The window didn't close proplerly so there was a draught and plenty of street noise. The curtains were cheap and too small and didn't keep the light out. The bulbs were dim and the decor was non-existent. It was more like a cell than a hotel room. This hotel has 3 stars - HOW??I'll not be going back.

<Author>H-Gt-Harwood.
<Content>I can't understand why all the bad reviews I booked this hotel with two friends to stay for 2 nights in a three bed room, then I read the reviews and I thought I had made a big mistake. On arriving at the hotel I remembered someone saying to ask for a room upstairs and avoid the basement. I asked but as the hotel was fully booked we had to go into the basement room number 2, I was getting ready to be dissapointed. On entering I could not beleive how clean and up to date the rooms were, three very comfortable single beds, air conditioning and digital safe both free of charge, lcd tv, clean well kept bathroom very hot and powerfull shower, fresh towels everyday, as much soap and shower gel as you would want. The room was big enough for three of us and the bathroom was big enough being tiled from floor to ceiling and the room having wooden flooring. The breakfast was ok consisting of a selection of meats, cheese and breads, boiled egg, tea, coffee and orange juice and you could have as much as you want. Overall I was impressed with the hotel and the staff who were helpfull and friendly and would stay here again. The people who have written the previous reviews cannot be living in the real world, this hotel is not what they are saying it is. The only bad thing I have to say is it was a little noisy when they were doing the breakfast as we where directly underneath, I would not expect it to be like this upstairs, but it acted as an alarm call to get up for breakfast. We paid 45 pounds each for the room for 2 nights including breakfast, 22.50p per night, come on folks lets be fair.

<Content>not that bad It was not that bad. So the steps are steep. We only had to use them once, going down. The breakfast was filling and basic: coffee, juice, meat, cheese, bread... Our room was a Quad and just fine for us. We are a family of 4 w/ 2 teenagers. The walk from the tram to the hotel was a bit much when arriving from Central Station but after that, the tram 2 blocks the other way was a breeze! The price was a bit high for us but I couldn't find anything cheaper. I'd stay here again.

<Content>worse than we expected If you are planning to stay at this hotel, do verify first that they are not going give you a room at the basement! It is a shame for a 3 star hotel. We had the curtains closed the whole time so as people walking outside (along a busy street) could not see us. There was not a lift and the stairs were steep. it麓s a pity paying a good amount of money and not having a decent view in amsterdam. Its location was nice, but still you can find many other hotels with better amenities and the same amount charged. Breakfast was ok.

<Content>Not Even A 2 Star I stayed here with 8 other girls on a hen party. We were actually moved from a hotel that had been flooded. We arrived gasping for a drink in the hot weather only to be told by the Manager that he didn't serve any kind of drinks until 3pm in the afternoon! We actually paid 拢75 p.n. for a double room and to be honest it wasn't worth 拢30. The hotel is a health hazzard. Light bulbs dripping and bare wires hanging out all over the place. You took you life in your hands with the lift! The breakfast was also awful, not worth getting out of bed for. The location is OK, but the hotel we booked was in the center so it was a tram ride in and taxi ride home each day which was a pain after trawling through the hotels on the internet to get one in the center.I would never go back to this hotel. Since this holiday I've visited Amsterdam again and stayed in the Amstel Botel which was a great location and price. Would deffo go there for any more visits to Dam.

<Content>Avoid this one Really pokey room, cold (in April). When they say there is a plasma TV in every room, that's because there's no room for a tube TV. Our room had no lift to it (is this 3 stars ?) and very steep stairs. The sagging bed was jammed up against a radiator which varied from freezing to dangerously hot. No hot water one morning. Breakfast very limited. Canned Heineken was the only beer in the bar. Full advertised twin room rate is 160 euros per night - this is laughable. The only good point is proximity to Leidsplein (but that's nothing to do with the hotel)

<Content>good Location For the price we paid this hotel was a bargain. It's in a great location, a couple of minutes walk from leidesplein. The rooms were not huge but they were clean and well equipped for what we needed them for (a change of clothes and sleep!) The shower was excellent!For a quiet hotel, close to bars and attractions but not in the seedy hub of Amsterdam this is the perfect location.

<Content>Hmmmmm Not Again I don't think Well, errr yeah... reasonable enough to be in other than there was no hot water on day 2 of our stay and the bar is err well shall we say limited to say the least. only serving canned beer, tango or Cola....No Tea or Coffee facilities in the room.. Very Very bland.All that said we really enjoyed the location as it is just a stones throw from Leidseplein, which in our opinion has to be one of the best places to stay near!

<Content>A relief after reading some other reviews... I eventually booked a quad room (for three people) at the Hotel de Paris after finding little choice at fairly short notice. It, and the others available, had some awful reviews and some that were OK.The first impressions were that the man at the reception desk was fairly short (to the point of being rude), but I think this may have been due to the language barrier. Other staff were fine.Entry is by bell only. At night, the reception staff have to unlock the door into the hotel as well.The room was as per the photographs. It wasn't too small, everything was clean and the bathroom was modern (with a good, hot shower). Our room was to the front, so we had a small balcony (nice in the morning and ideal for a smoke). However, the door to the balcony and the window didn't lock properly, so Spiderman could break in fairly easily.We didn't try breakfast (we're not early starters!) so I can't comment on that. All in all, it was better than expected, and not an unpleasant place to stay. I wonder if all the rooms are as good as ours!Good points: Location, security, OK for cleanliness.Bad points: Narrow stairs and dangerous lift (typical for Amsterdam), staff can appear rude, 5% tax not included, 3% credit card surcharge.

<Content>decent enough we came here in may 2004 and it was perfect was us we just wanted to somewhere to crash near the nightlife and sightseeing. the rooms were dated but clean, our bathroom was clean and everything was in order. it worked out at about 15pound a night per person based on 3 sharing so i knew it wasnt going to be the ritz carlton. for the price i would stay here again but if i could afford more when i return to amsterdam i would pay extra and get something a bit more comfy. but for stag do's - perfect. wouldnt recommend to coupled on a romantic getaway. also we found the reception and bar staff to be extremely friendly.

<Content>Ideal situation and friendly staff The hotel is in a great location near Leidsplein. We were 4 couples late forties and enjoyed our stay. Having read previous reviews I can only imagine it has changed dramatically. The rooms are small but are cleaned every day and the bathroom and shower are a suitable size. Breakfast is basic but was what we expected. The staff were friendly and helpful and arranged transport for us when leaving. The night porter who served at the bar was very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. One thing, use the lift as the stairs are very steep. If you are looking for a base to explore Amsterdam it is ideal.

<Content>Biggest Hovel in Holland Booked over the net for 3 nights from 11th march 2005. Looked so good in the photo. We are 2 couples in our forties and we should have known better than to book before we had read any reviews on wonderful sites like these. We arrived on a cold wet night at 8pm, and first impressions from the ouside and reception was good. It was oldie worldy looking, just how i imagined an Amsterdam Hotel. We were given the keys to our rooms and went upstairs. (just writing this 4 days later and i can hear that music from the film were the girl is gonna get knifed in the shower)!The hallway and the rooms were FILTHY. The rooms were tiny, the bathrooms stank, and there was not enough room to hang hardly any clothes. We did not even unpack. When my mate wrote his name in the dust on the carpet and we pulled back the sheets on the bed and saw all THOSE stains, we knew we could not stay for one night.No one in thier right minds could say this is a nice hotel. They should not be allowed to call it a one star let alone 3 star.Dont listen to the good reviews on this hotel, they have got to be a wind up. Dont go there...I beg you!

<Content>Absolutely Disgraceful!!!!!!! This Hotel (if I can call it that!!!) was an absolute disgrace and I am ashamed to admit that I fell for their advertising campaign!! I am also sure that a few people on this site are having fun with users by posting FALSE reviews of this hotel. How anyone can say this was a good hotel is beyond me.We walked into our room and were shocked and speachless at what we got for what we were paying! The room was tiny, the double bed was a single bed, the carpet smelt, the top sheet was stained, the staff were rude and obnoxious and the breakfast I wouldn't feed to my dog! I sat on the toilet and bruised my knees as they hit the door of the toilet! That is how small this bathroom in this HOSTEL is!!!!The location was great but there are many hotels around the Leidelsplein that you could stay at for a cheaper rate and be a hell of a lot more comfortable!!!If you read this review and still stay at this Hotel then you must have rocks in your head!!!IT IS AN ABSOLUTE DIVE! It is not a 3 star hotel, it is a very bad Hostel!!!!DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!
