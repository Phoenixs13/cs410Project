<Content>Good value for money The hotel was great value for money. OK, it could do with a bit of an update but the room was very spacious and had all the comforts you would expect plus some more (a sofa, for example). The rate we paid (the cheapest for this hotel), included parking (guarded, in the building itself) and a good cooked breakfast.The location is quite good too: a 5-10 minute walk from the centre (Avenida Juarez and Plaza de la Solaridad), 5-10 minute walk to the closest Metro station and a 20-25 minute walk from the Zocalo (or take the Metro). The road the hotel is in is a little rundown but feels perfectly safe.Most of the staff speak little or no English and this may account for some of the previous negative reviews. We found the staff polite and reasonable.On balance, better than expected.

<Content>Average I was with my family in this hotel in the end of September this year and all I can say is a good hotel, it needs a little maintenance indeed but the location is pretty good and you can feel safe thinking you're in a dangerous city, taxis are always available and the staff is helpful, that was the most important thing it could happened to us as my little boy needed drinkable water and they provided with no extra cost!! I recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Staff and Stay On our arrival, the bell person tried to sells us homemade mole, to bring back to the states (that was tacky). I stayed in this hotel for a total of four days, staff was friendly.The restaurant staff was very slow and did not acknowledge your needs.The rooms are clean and comfortable.The location is not that great.The hotel staff (bell person, front desk) very friendly and helpful.

<Content>good value for money! The hotel was more than perfect. It is located in the center of mexico city, not the fanciest part, but close to all the tourist atractions and the metro (which was a great way of transport, costs 2 pesos which is like 10 cent). The staff was especially nice, and its not their fault that the exchange rate in the hotel is a theft. The thing to do is to change money in the bank or in the change houses. The restaurant is ok, not the best food but the service is good and its not too bad as there are not a lot of good looking restaurants on the area. The rooms were the best. They are huge, confortable, big bathroom and very clean. the only thing is I had to ask for another pillow as the one they have is a rock... Another thing I didnt quite liked was that you have to leave a deposit to use the safe in the lobby and even to get a remote for the tv, it was a bit anoying but you get your money back afterwards. We had a great time in mexico city and the best western estoril hotel was a very nice place to be if you are traveling with a budget.

<Content>not the friendliest staff The hotel was nice. Rooms were spacious. Terrible view of a parking lot. No nice restaraunts nearby.Most of all, the staff was not the friendliest. Everytime I would ask a question they looked at me as if I were stupid. And I spoke to them in spanish!!! Second, several times I cashed american dollars into mexican pesos....and found out later that they were not giving me the correct exchange amount. For every american $20.00 I should have received $222.20pesos..which is $22.20 american dollars. My friend and I must have exchanged at least $200.00 for mexican pesos! I haven't calculated exactly how much they shorted me..but i'm sure we left them a nice chunk of change for them to take home and we didn't even know it! The whole staff is very dishonest! BEWARE to anyone who stays at this Best Western, make sure they know that you know what the exchange value is for every american dollar! And if you plan to make reservations inside the hotel for a tour of the city make sure you don't get ripped off like we did. We paid the man $150.00 american dollars and he pulls up in his 1982 4-door oldsmobile (falling apart) and asks us if we're ready to go! We thought we were going in a tour bus! On the way back from the Pyramids his car starts smoking from the engine and breaks down in the middle of the highway! We were stuck out there for atleast 2 hours. If you're gonna reserve a tour make sure you are going in an actual tour bus with an actual tour guide. The tour is not worth $150.00!!!! We should of paid him $60.00 for all three of us! BE VERY CAUTIOUS!!!!!!!!

<Content>a mixed bag The hotel itself is very nice. The lobby and bedrooms are very clean and modern. The restaurant is reasonably priced and the food is more than adequate. The hotel's location is not the best because the area is mostly commercial, so in the evenings there is not much to see and there are very few restaurants in the area.The biggest disappointment was the hotel staff. Some of the front desk personnel were not nice at all. Also, we were told that if we called the hotel while we were out site seeing, the hotel would send a reliable taxi to our location to return us to the hotel. However, when we called the hotel, the front desk said that the hotel could not call a taxi for us. Hence, we were forced to take public transportation during rush hour.The hotel needs to be more responsive to its guests.
