<Content>russian state block All the staff were very pleasant, the breakfast is good with a wide selection of meats, rolls and juices even the bar food is appropiate if your in a rush and need something warm to keep you going.Mind you the overall decor does seem like your in a russian KGB camp, very seventies looking and the rooms are very basic with no coffee or tea making facilities, plus I did have a few red bite marks the next day so bed bugs love it here...It's only about a five minute walk from the station, but for lone women watch out at the underpass at night, can feel lonely with some dodgy people walking around.Holland is known for high price hotels, so this one does meet the budget, lift access and many of the rooms do have a balcony and at least you dont get an early door knock for room service if you did have a heavy night before.You will find a host of different nationalities at breakfast and I did notice a few helping themselves many times as it seems they havnt eaten for a week.

<Content>Whatever falls on the floor at the Casa stays on the floor... I am a 27 year old female who stayed at the Casa will 2 other women. I stayed at the Casa 400 to kick of my two week European vacation. I was pleasently suprised by the lobby- it was clean and modern. My happy suprises ended there. My room was disgusting. The carpet looked as though it had never been shampooed and I had an alergic reaction the heavily starched sheets. I was disgusted by the room. As for the location- the location would have been nice if the nearby Amstel station was not undergoing massive construction. The hotel was also loud as there were many (very young- under 20s even) groups staying at the hotel. This hotel is for people who think they are too good for a hostel but are not!

<Content>Just a bed and a shower It's about what you expect at your stay. I was looking for a cheap room, a clean bed and a shower. Yes! I got what I expected but then I realised that I missed something in my expectations, a decent wardrobe. Room hasn't got a wardrobe, so you have to keep your luggage almost packed. Location of the hotel is just a little walk from a big station called AmstelStation where you can go to anywhere you want in the city even to Belgium or Germany (I'm not kidding). I'd just recommend it for young Amsterdam lovers!!!

<Content>Fine for stag nights Stayed here for a stag weekend. To be honest it鈥檚 about all the hotel is good for. The room was basic with three 鈥榸-beds鈥? The main problem is the fact that it鈥檚 located in the middle of nowhere. A taxi to/from the centre is 13 to 15 euros. The metro train station is a short walk from the hotel and much cheaper. A group ticket for seven of us was 6.80 euros each way.On the plus side the beds were clean and the continental breakfast was okay (cold meats, juice, coffee, toast, cheese etc)Incidentally, breakfast was crowded both days. If I was going to Amsterdam again with my wife then I would definitely not stay here but if you鈥檙e on a stag/hen night and you can鈥檛 find anything nearer the centre that will take a group then I suppose it鈥檚 okay.

<Content>What a boring place! Wanted to go to Amsterdam at the last minute. Got ourselves booked into the Greenhouse Effect for two nights but then had 1 night to find. (Saturday) Went to hotelrunners.com near the red light district and the young lady on the desk told us that the only hotel that they had was the casa 400. Well, we didn't have any choice. Hoped on the metro and 4 stops later got to our location. We walked around the large roundabout for a good half hour only to find out that had we gone around the roundabout a different way it would have taken us 2 minutes (Oh well!)The hotel looks like any other balkan state square thing stuck in the ground. Reception was nicely decked out and altough I had sampled some of Amsterdam finest, this didn't seemt o faze the receptionist.Room - square and boring - very very warm, although they gave us a fan. TV, ok but on the desk so not a good view here from the person who has the bed farthest away.Breakfast was ok. Hotel was clean (not cheap)

<Content>Cheap and cheerful Not quite sure where to start with this hotel. As we didn't book the trip until late, we were limited on hotels to choose from. Eventually we settled on this due to the price. The first thing you notice is the size of the hotel. It used to be a big conference centre that has been changed to a hotel. They must have approximately 800 bedrooms. Due to arrival time at Schipol we got a taxi at approximate cost of 40 Euros. The impressions you get from outside, is Oh my god what have we booked, however check in was quick and effortless. The rooms are really basic, however were clean. There was no airconditioning but the rooms were supplied with a fan. My tip would be to request a room not overlooking the front of the building my friends mentioned they were constantly awake from noise of people getting back to the hotel at night and people leaving in the morning. I did not notice anything from the other side. We did have a snack at the bar, it wasn't the greatest of meals. Apparently to get into the centre by train is easy, however a we used taxis all weekend and paid 12-14 Euros a trip to get to Dam Square. I would use this hotel again if I was in a large group or was consious about the price of hotels in the centre. To sum up, the hotel is Ok the staff are good and helpful, the price is good. The rooms are basic and clean.

<Content>Good value for busy Amsterdam Good points: Good price, clean, efficient and friendly service, decent breakfast. Bad points: Not in the centre of the city. Amsterdam can be difficult to find cheap, decent accomodation. Casa 400 Hotel is only open in the Summer months to cater for the extra tourists. The rooms are basic but adequate. It is a 10 minute walk from Amstel station which is a station that all lines pass so you only have to wait about 7 minutes for a train. It is extraordinarily well sign posted (look across the square towards the climbing man). You have to pass through a tunnel which we found to be very well lit. It seemed darker during the day than at night! I would happily go back again if I couldn't find a place in the centre of the city at an affordable price.

<Content>Fair price and clean I've stayed at the Casa 400 twice since 2002. The reception staff are friendly and helpful and the security lockers are good. The rooms were compact and basic but they were also clean and more than adequate. When you bear in mind the price that you are paying the Casa 400 represents good value for money and peace and quiet compared to the hotels nearer the centre. Transportation was not a problem. Amstel station is on both the main line and the subway and with the strippenkart transport ticket it was easy to get around. I would definitely choose to stay here again.

<Content>Basic, clean  I stayed at the Casa 400 with 5 others for 3 nights at the beginning of September 2004. The rooms were basic - no tea and coffee facilities, however they were clean and there was a daily maid service.We had 2 rooms that slept three, I think the rooms were no larger than a twin - they had just stuck another bed in!The hotel itself is a little way from the city - BUT not too far, just a train ride away. The station is close so thats ok. (If you are staying a few nights and will be going in/out of city frequently get a strip train ticket to save money)The only actual 'downside' was the breakfast, I had not been to Holland before so I don't know if it was the standard but it was a COLD breakfast with yucky tea and coffee.We didn't eat in the restaurant, but the menu appeared expensive for the food available.I wouldn't rush back but its not a bad place to stay!!

<Content>Very average Casa 400 Casa 400, Is a very basic hotel.I stayed there with a group of friends for my stag do.Nothing extraordianry,not exciting, and as someone has mentioned before no great shakes.But near the station,so easy to get a train if you want to get out of there!The food is garbage, and it is set upon a derelict estate where serious renovation needs doing to it.Just went to sleep there and very little else. Staff service was also average, but what do you expect for that price.

<Content>It's not a hotel ! I stayed here in 2001 - it looks like a 60's office block 'cos that's what it is !It's a conference centre and is only open to holiday guests during the summer - that's why it was so cheap.It is a metro trip into town - get a taxi back at night.Not recommended for ladies as not in a safe part of town - OK for a group of lads though

<Content>good enough clean hotel modern .rather boring area of town i.e dont hang about here .only a place to sleep and wash.rather dodgy dark underpass sort of tunnel to go under to reach amstel metro station to travel into town centre be wary at night its rather dark and poorly lit.metro sytem from here to town is first class for all that all in all a half decent place to stay but there are better nearer town for same money.last but not least especially if ur from uk dont expect much of a breakfast.strange cold meats and stuff .im maybe just too fussy.

<Content>Casa 400 - Nothing Special Located about 10 minutes by Metro from city centre in a not too pleasant area. No restaurants or bars close to the hotel. Slightly isolated, but Metro station about 10 minutes walk. Metro or taxi is essential. No A/C but large fans provided in the room to cool you off in high summer. Basic, clean rooms with simple furniture. Only ate breakfast in the hotel but it was adequate. Hotel popular with coach tour operators. When we arrived there were no towels provided, but a trip to hotel reception cured this. Would not go back as I'm sure there are better hotels nearer the city centre for the same cost. Looks like a 1960's office block with rooms to match.
