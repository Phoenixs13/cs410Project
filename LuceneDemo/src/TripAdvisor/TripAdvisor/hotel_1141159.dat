<Content>great location and comfortable room My wife and I was looking for a good not too pricey place in expensive Barcelona and we settled on las ramblas apartments bed and breakfast.The place is right on the Ramblas with a few minute walk to the market. So it's a perfect location.The room was clean with a double bed (not two twins pushed together like many other places) and a clean private bathroom. The place also has a kitchen that you can use if you want to cook and save some money. A big bonus was that although the place is right on las ramblas the rooms don't face the street so it's a quiet stay.For the price and location you can't go wrong.

<Content>Great alternative for families Stayed at Las Ramblas I Apartements during a family vacation. We loved it! Felt like being in our own house. There is even a supermarket closeby, which was nice because we were able to cook a few meals during our stay.The apartments are clean, quiet, and VERY close to Las Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter. Although we had been told that Barcelona麓s public transportation was easy to use, we ended up walking everywhere as sights were so close to the apartments!
