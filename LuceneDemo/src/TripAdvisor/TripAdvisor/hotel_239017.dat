<Content>Good location, small room The room was a little smaller than we had expected, but we got what we paid for. We had a room for two, with bunk beds. The staff is friendly and helpful. The Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum are a block away and the very useful tram stops less than a block away. The bathroom was clean and new, but exceptionally small. We paid a total of ~170 Euros for a two night stay. I would stay there again but would pay for a bigger room.We booked through http://hotels.hollandbookings.com

<Content>Good value hotel in good location We have just returned from Amsterdam after having a lovely short break in this fantastic city.We spent 3 nights at the Trianon hotel, we was unsure what to expect from this hotel after reading some of the previous reviews/ lack of them. However we were pleasantly suprised, five star it certainly isn't, but it is clean with an adequate bathroom. We had a double troom, it wasn't massive but we didn't spend much time in it , the bed was comfy.Breakfast was being served next door in the restraunt of the concertgebouw (concert hall) while they renovate he hotel's kitchen, but that wasn't a problem there was a good selection of food (continental breakfast) and you could eat as much as like.We found the hotel to be in a nice quiet location a stones throw away from the Van Gough museum and within easy reach of all the other major attractions. The no. 5 tram goes from just up the street right into the centre of Amsterdam however we walked, nowhere is really that far away and we didn't want to miss the beauty of the buildings and canals.

<Content>would have been better in a hostel The rooms are comparable to a hostel - they're tiny, old uncomfortable matress and could smell smoke from the kitchen staff all the up the flights of stairs - even though I was in a non-smoking room.Location is just fine as Amsterdam is so small and easy to get around and the tram stop is at the top of the street.The pictures of the hotel provides are definately making it look better than it is.

<Content>fantastic value Fantastic value for the price, great location for van gogh museum etc. Our room had view of the concertfebouw (gorgeous building). All the staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms aren't huge but are clean and for the price and 2* what more do you want.

<Content>Good clean hotel, Get what you pay for. If you are looking for pure luxury or you are one of those people who expect 4 star and above standards from a 2 star hotel, but with 2 star standards, then dont bother with this hotel.HOWEVERIf your looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a nice quiet area of amsterdam then this may well be for you. Yes the rooms are small, yes the bathrooms are also small, but if someone can show me a 2 star hotel in amsterdam in a nice area like this which is only a short tram ride to all the major attractions, and has bigger rooms, and is cheaper than this hotel then I would like to see it.The staff were spot on, they were extremely helpful and friendly, they spoke perfect english, they bent over backwards to help us, they told us what to avoid so as not to get ripped off etc.Why people go to these 2 star hotels around the world and expect 4 star quality but with 2 star prices is beyond me.I had a 2 bed room which was bunkbeds and it was small, however the photographs clearly show this, so why complain afterwards when all you need to do is look at the photos before booking, some of our party had a room for 3 and this was a lot lot bigger so if your after size pay the extra and book a room for 3, or simply stay at a 4 star hotel.Simply ask before hand for a larger room or a double THEY SPEAK PERFECT ENGLISH on the desk.

<Content>Ooh dear... My husband and I stayed here in Feb 07 for 3 nights. It is very easy to find as the tram stops just outside. It took about 20 minutes by tram to get to the centre. Situated in the museum quarter and, unless you like museums!, not much to do in the immediate area but Leidseplein is about a 3 minute tram ride and we absolutely loved it there!Now, on to the hotel itself. The rooms are absolutely TINY! And with the bare painted walls, it is just like a prison cell. The bathroom is even funnier - just enough room for a toilet and a half size bath, with the sink squashed in at the end of your bed. Also, we experienced a lot of noise from the people in the room above so not much sleep. The breakfast room, on the other hand is very nice as it also serves as a restaurant in the evenings. Traditional European continental breakfast is served. Quite a lot of choice. I would say - if you are looking for a room on a budget and don't intend to spend much time at the hotel (like us!) then this place is fine. Don't expect any luxury - just a place to rest your head after a long day.

<Content>Stay away from Trianon. The rooms are terribly small, there is absolutely no silencing between the rooms, i found trash under my bed, there is mould in the bathroom, you won't find any hospitality in the reception. Didn't see a smile on their faces at all. Choose another hotel!

<Content>Not Recommended I will start with the positives. In a good location , near Van Gogh gallery, walking distance to the centre and on tram route 5 direct to the railway station. Staff were friendly. But.....on the downside, it was a very poor hotel. When shown to my room, I opened the door, my immediate thought was Why has someone left that tatty little bed in this small corridor, then I realised it was my room! Rooms were small smelly and had damp patches, they were furnished with very old carpets, curtains and furniture. The walls had not seen paint in many years and were very yellow. I had requested a non smoking room, my room stunk of smoke. The bathroom was basically ok with plenty of hot water, but had a permanent stale urine smell. Also greeting me in my room was a dirty glass starting to go mouldy. The plumbing was very noisy , keeping me awake till 2/3a.m. , then I was woken up again around 5a.m. by roudy revellers returning from a night out. Breakfast was ok if you were there early, but if you went down after 8.30, all the good stuff (eggs,ham,cheese) was gone, and was not replenished by the staff. So twice I had to settle for bread and jam. Also some free services promised such as satellite tv and use of a safe were either pay extra or non existant.Overall shockingly poor. Only go to this hotel if there is absolutely no other option.

<Content>Better than expected We booked this hotel, then I read the reviews and would have cancelled except it was too short notice, however we were pleasantly surprised when we stayed there.Quiet location but tram stop to Central station at end of road.Not many restaurants etc very near but Leidseplein only two tram stops away with plenty of choice.Staff friendly and helpful but it was November so out of season and they may be less helpful when busyRooms are small and carpets shabby but bathrooms are good.Rooms and bathrooms are clean and warm with plenty of hot water, linens and towels are spotlessBreakfast was very good for continentThere is a lift, not always the case in AmsterdamAltogether our stay was better than expected, however do take a universal sink plug and watch out for mosquitoes, even in NovemberGuide books do say generally hotel rooms in Amsterdam are small and smelling of damp and mildew is a problem there

<Content>Prison Cell This hotel was booked for me through a Bristol, UK travel agent which they booked through Amsterdam Hotels Co. My room was on the second floor. The room was approx. 9ft. long by 6ft. wide. The only window to let air in or out comprised a single glass door which opened out onto a balcony shared with two other rooms. A 6-pack was in a corner of the balcony. Along one side of the cell was a metal bunk bed. In order to have any air in the room, the balcony door would have to remain open. This room was booked for me under my name with Mrs. as my title. I immediately left the room and after great difficulty found another hotel. I then returned to the Trianon and told the clerk I would not be staying the four nights booked, but that I was willing to pay for the first night even though I wouldn't be staying there. He was quite annoyed and told me I should have told him I was not satisfied and he would have found me another room. I told him that if he didn't question the room I was given (a woman travelling alone) how could I rely on him to give me a safe, decent room? This hotel may be okay for backpackers and one-night stands, but it definitely is not a place for anyone who is looking to feel safe and comfortable. Obviously, the booking agents either do not consider the safety factor for women travellers or just don't care as long as they get their commission.

<Content>Smallest Room Ever Our stay in Amsterdam was the last week in June, upon arrival at the hotel we were dealt with a chap who was dressed in combat gear, he was rude and I nearly gave him a mouthful back. The room was the smallest Ive ever stayed in, but apart from that the room was clean and as the weather was boiling i was hardly there only to sleep and have breakfast (which was ok),. I had no real problems with this place, however, I will not stay there again

<Content>A True Pit My husband and I booked Hotel Trianon through an online service and were looking forward to it's great location as we only had one full day to enjoy Amsterdam. It was the worst hotel I've ever been to, starting with the desk clerk who was rude and barely spoke English and the elevator which couldn't hold both of us and our small suitcases, to the urine stenched hallways and black mold on the window frames. It was so bad in fact that after checking in we braved the torrential rains outside to go find a new hotel so that we could move. I literally don't think we'd have been able to spend a night there, just upon entering the room both my husband and I became so congested from the mold and mildew we coudl hardly breathe. It was well worth the extra few dollars to get a good nights sleep somewhere/anywhere else.

<Content>Avoid We went to Amsterdam this June and were unfortunate enough to stay at the Trianon Hotel. We came as a business management group of 8 for a Teambuilding weekend. The hotel was listed as having a safe in every room but not one of us had one, as a result we all had to carry our passports and euro's around with us all the time as the room was not very secure. (Another member of our party was even given the key to another guests room). The rooms had no Air Conditioning, no Tea and Coffee making facilities, and were so small you had to put your case infront of the bed and wardrobe so couldn't use the wardrobe easily, it was more like a corridor than a room. The bathroom was so minute that we had the sink in the bedroom with us which had the tap dripping constantly. Carpets were old, smelly and had remnants of the previous occupants hair in amongst other things. There was no bar open as advertised, the only bar was a mini fridge in the reception full of tinned Lager. Breakfast was just okay, but the reception staff during the day weren't very helpful and seemed irritated if asked for assistance with Airport transport. We ended up dragging our cases around the block to another hotel and asked them to arrange our transport back to the airport which was done in minutes, free of charge. We couldn't wait to get home to our much cleaner environment, clean streets, clean people and clean beds. It's Great to be back in the UK.

<Content>Disaster Eight of us stayed here and all of us are of the same opinion. This should be classed as a hostel, not a hotel. The room was minute to say the least, the bathroom was so small that the sink had to go in the bedroom, (which by the way was more like a corridor), next to the bed. No tea and coffee making facilities, no air con  no safe in the room, the tap water was drinkable but warm, the room smelt of urine and you most likely won't be able to open your window, infact once out of reception, the whole hotel had a strange odour. The website also says there is a bar, this consists of a mini fridge in reception selling only Heineken in tins. Breakfast was just okay, stick to toast and rolls with jam. The staff were curt, unwelcoming and bad mannered, only the cleaners said hello each day. Infact we got this reaction wherever we went in Amsterdam, only a minority of Dutch people were friendly towards us. The town (red light district Central) was miles away on a tram, ensure you have a ticket or you will be publically humiliated by the inspectors. You buy them off the driver, oh and make sure you always look both ways when crossing the road. Don't leave valuables in your room either, they will give your room key to anybody. We were a mature party of eight adults, this hotel would be more suited as a HOSTEL for the Amsterdam under privilaged. Whatever you do, don't waste your money here, the Dutch hotel ratings are not to the quality of the UK. We all hope that once you change your booking to an alternative, more suitable hotel, that you will have a better experience than we all did.

<Content>Great breakfast and location. The Trianon is a great place to stay if you're going to a performance at the Concertgebouw, since it's right next door. You would expect to find a nicer hotel right next to one of the world's finest concert halls, though. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet. The rooms, on the other hand ae another thing. The bathrooms look like they came out of WWII Europe, and the carleting is beyond disgusting. Still, the beds were clean, the hallways were very well lit, and they have an elevator. The Trianon is fine for a night or two, but I wouldn't pick this hotel for an extended stay.

<Content>You get what you pay for We spent 3 nights at the Trianon Hotel over Queen's Day 2006 weekend and this hotel was one of very few that had availability and didn't cost the earth. But after reading the reviews on this site, I was tempted to cancel the whole trip as I was expecting a rotten dirty hell-hole. However, we decided to go anyway and I'm so glad as we had a fantastic time and the hotel is nowhere near as bad as some of the reviews that I read. We booked a twin and a triple room and although the twin room was really small, it was clean and had everything we needed. We didn't spend that much time at the hotel as we were out and about all day so the lack of space really was not an issue. The triple room was a lot more roomy so would definitely recommend the triple if you are staying for more than a week or if you like to spend a lot of time in your hotel room.The Trianon offers cheap accomodation in a clean basic hotel within walking distance of all the attractions that Amsterdam has to offer. We didn't use the trams but there is a tram stop literally a few minutes away if you don't fancy walking everywhere. It is in the quieter area of Amsterdam near to Vondelpark and all the museums but there are plenty of shops and restaurants close by. If you are looking to go to Amsterdam and want to stay somewhere in a central location, is clean and on a budget, then I would definitely recommend the Trianon.

<Content>Recently stayed at Trianon Just stayed at the Trianon Hotel in Amsterdam. This was a basic hotel but clean. It was cleaned every day we stayed and beds remade. Breakfast was of a good standard for a continental breakfast and plenty there to choose from. I personally found that it was in a good location for getting around amsterdam - close to canal bus, tram and in walking distance of some museums. I enjoyed my stay here and enjoyed wandering to the leidersplein area as I much preferred this square to the Dam square itself as it wasn't as busy but had lots of street entertainers on and fab cafes.

<Content>Awful We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights last September. The room was the smallest we have ever seen. It was almost impossible to fit our 2 small luggages inside the room. The bathroom was very small and disgusting. The TV was very old and with no remote control. Moreover, the hotel room and the corridors were very hot. There was almost no ventilation. It was the most expensive hotel per square meter we have ever stayed, since we payed a rate compatible to a good hotel chain anywhere in the world.Please do not go to this hotel. The price is not fair to what it is offered.We accept to stay in any clean and simple hotel but the Trianon is not enough considering the minimum necessary for a hotel room.Since Amsterdam is a great city, the great time we had there compensated this terrible hotel.

<Content>Good location, average hotel My friend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and 5 days. When we finally arrived at midnight we were unhappy to discover that the hotel was over booked. Thankfully they had a triple room left eventhought we had only paied for a double. It was almost impossible to sleep because it was so incredibly hot in the room and due to the lack of a/c nothing could be done. The breakfast is not worth it. You're better off eating at on of the many restaurants located close by. The good things about this hotel were that it is located very close to the Vondelpark and the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh. Some of the front desk people (with exceptions) are very friendly and helpful. One of them arranged for a cab to be waiting for us on the day of our departure. Upon arrival at the hotel I encountered the front desk person who was less than friendly. I was forced to fill out and identity card as he call it and would not explain why. Lets just say that all the info given to him was not entirely correct...
