<Content>Good location, good and comfortable sleep Regin hotel is located very near the kallang station, 5-10 minutes walk only. It may be located in the Geylang area but not right into the heart of the red light district. it is nicely situated near the intersection of sim's ave and sim's way. Among the budget hotels, it is the one which is least expensive and I would say that it is a good value for the money. And booking is not so hard, just email the hotel directly and they would do the rest and no credit card is needed, full payment is upon arrival. Although the room is smaller than the picture in the website. But It is relatively clean. They change your towels and linens daily, and the sheets are spotlessly clean and white. you get 2 bottles of drinking water and instant coffee daily. I guess, the next time we go back to singapore, we would stay again at regin hotel. We had a good night sleep after a whole day of walking around and enjoying singapore.  Only warning is that when coming from the airport, tell the taxi driver that you are going to sims ave then tell them Regin hotel. We were initially brought to REGENT hotel hehehehe but the taxi driver was very apologetic and gave us a discount so it was okay because we had an initial tour of the city as well.  this trip was my third time at singapore and i guess i would be coming back again.

<Content>Best deal! If you're on a budget and not the picky type, I highly recommend this hotel. They have the best rates - all below SGD100/room/night. Their rooms are clean, with A/C, cable TV and coffee-/tea-making facilities. The ensuite bathroom is a good size, clean and has hot shower.The hotel is about 8-10 minutes walk from Kallang MRT station. It's in the Geylang area (red light district) but the area around the hotel itself is decent, safe and not sleazy at all.Only hassle - the elevator only goes up to the 3rd floor. Since our room is on the 4th floor, we had to walk up a flight of stairs (and drag our luggage on check-in/check-out dates).Also, the rooms look bigger/brighter/prettier in their website photos. The actual room looks/feels smaller but there's still ample space to move around.All in all, it was a good choice. Given our budget, I think we got the best deal with Regin Hotel.
