<Content>Rude, Nasty Staff, Dirty Room, Horrible ! We saw an ad for this hotel in Que Pasa magazine and thought it mught be nice. But be warned, there is NO BEACH, what they call a beach is a small strip in front of someone else's home. When we got there, the staff in the front desk is rude and nasty. They placed us on the 3rd floor and there are NO ELEVATORS and we have very heavy luggage. We asked for a room in the 1st floor but again we were rudely informed that the hotel was fully booked. Our car was the only car in the parking lot and I realized that evening that we were the only people in that hotel because their restaurant is also empty. We got out of there early the following day, and we asked if they have continental breakfast, coffee and some toast and again we were informed rudely that we have to pay for it. So we got out of there by 7 AM the following day. NEVER AGAIN !

<Content>Horrible!!! Terrible experience. Will never do it again. Heed the warning. Dirty stained sheets, dirty walls, and dirty disgusting furniture. Not to mention completely rude staff. You pay american dollars but you get rude staff and dirty room. Couldn't pay me to stay there again.

<Content>So-so Ok, my biggest complaint was the attitude of the staff. The room was clean, tho of all the places we stayed it was the only one with carpets. I like the tile floors that everyone else had - the are cleaner. Otherwise, for the money it was a good value. Didn't go to the pool or the beach it was a one nite stay - Christmas nite. Dinnerin the restaurant was decent, but not great. The early wait staff had no idea about many items on the menu. The second shift came on while we were there and I will say he seemed more competent. Breakfast was another story, quite good and plenty of food served by the pool with a smile from a nice young lady. The front desk personal were cold and not very accommodating, but they did locate face cloths when we asked.

<Content>Glorified Crack House with blue toilets and stained covers I will try to be brief and concise. When we arrived at Perichi鈥檚, the first view of the hotel where hanging mattresses that resembled the hanging Gardens of Babylon. We all thought, 鈥渙h well, they are renovating鈥?so we didn鈥檛 put much thought into it. When we got our keys, accompanied with a generic TV remote, I grabbed our baggage and quickly went to our room to try to get a hot shower after a day of sight seeing. Walking towards the room, I saw that the doors seemed old and rustic; I thought it was part of the ambiance. When I opened the door of the room the hurricane sounding air conditioning was on and the moist/molded/cigarette air embalmed my nostrils with pizzazz. The bed covers had a huge unidentified stain right in the middle of the bed. I quickly took the covers and threw them in the corner of the room. When I do a 360 look around the room, I thought I was in the movie Trainspotting. The walls where stained and cracks where noticeable on the ceiling. When I enter the bathroom there was a blue toilet bowl from the 60鈥檚 accompanied by a blue sink and blue tub. I have to say that the blue matched perfectly with the blue 鈥渇lower power鈥?tiles on the wall. I walked back to the room and noticed that they where triangle shaped patterns on the rug. When I took a closer look, I realized that they where hot iron marks. It seems that a several guests left the iron on the floor. After I laughed and told many times to my girlfriend that I was sorry, we laughed and played along with the hotels crack house theme. I went to the front desk to complain about the room and they just stared at me like I was speaking Cantonese. For the record, I鈥檓 from Puerto Rico and my primary language is Spanish. The morning after our arrival we ate breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast was good and I cannot complain about the service. While I was eating, I was looking at the people that where working on the renovation of the hotel. They where spreading a roll of carpet. What was strange is that the carpet seemed old. Then I realized that they where replacing the old carpet with used carpet. Of course, how can you keep a Crack House themed hotel working with new carpet or new appliances. Maybe they just leave the carpet in sea water for days and employ people to intentionally burn the carpets with hot irons just for looks. Overall I have to say that the hotel is a mess, I stayed in the room in the front of the hotel and they seem to be the worst ones in the premises. The staff was nice although the administration keeps the place looking cheap and tasteless. It鈥檚 very sad that on this part of the island there is a limited amount of choices when it comes to hotels or bedbreakfast. My advice is, spend 20 dollars more and stay somewhere else. This is definitely not worth the money. Maybe they should change the name from Perichi鈥檚 to Perish鈥?s.

<Content>Be warned Stayed here 2 days with my sister; we both know island very well. We stayed at Perichi's on business, not vacation. The brochure for Perichi's, as well as a lot of the PR tourist literature, is misleading. There is no beach in walking distance, at least not any you'd like to bathe in. There is a picture of a beautiful beach in the brochure but if it is the beach the receptionist claimed it was, it is a long car-ride away, and I suspect that it was taken a long time ago when it was still nice. The waterfront by Perichi's is completely covered by a string of eateries and houses, not all in the best condition. The pool faces the parkinglot. The most basic rooms, in the main building, are musty smelling, have no hangers in closet.On plus side, it was clean, staff is very nice and restaurant is good. Eateries along water have good local food.

<Content>Pleasant Stay We stayed at this hotel during our recent week-long stay in Puerto Rico, and it was a welcome relief after our hotel in San Juan (reviewed elsewhere.)The hotel was surprisingly empty for January, prime time for a getaway to a warm place by most Midwesterners. I saw no fellow tourists at the hotel the first night, and just a couple on the second night.The Sea is across the street, but behind a row of builidings, with only a small viewing area to walk out by the water.The pool area is nice to sit out on, even if you don't swim. Breakfast is served on a covered verenda overlooking the pool area in the a.m., including fresh pineapple or other locally-grown produce. Out of four hotels we stayed in in Puerto Rico, this was the only one that had carpets on the floors. Hard ceramic tiles seem to the norm elsewhere. The air conditioning was very functional -- especially when the cleaning people turned it down to 17 celcius in our absence! Curtains on the patio doors are quite thin, and the clatter of a nearby school can be heard quite early in the morning, but otherwise this is a nice quiet and private getaway.

<Content>Leaves a little to be desired, but not too bad. Perichi's has the nicest restaurante that we ate at during our 10 days in Puerto Rico, very good food for a reasonable price. It is a stones throw from the water, but no beach. The grounds and the rooms were clean, nice pool area, and lots of parking space. It may not sound like it, but I mean this review to be more of an informational one than a complaint, because we were comfortable there, but expected a little more. The hottest the hot water got all week was luke warm, and we took a couple of cold showers. The facuet in the sink was on-off, no adjustment for hot and cold, no wash cloths, just towels, no clock, no fridge, no microwave, no plug in the sink, (nice for putting in contacts) and 3 stories high with no elevator.
