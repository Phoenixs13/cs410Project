<Content>Thank Goodness for the Melia Barcelona We booked a suite at the Melia Barcelona truely at the last minute on one of the last minute hotel websites. We arrived in Barcelona on the Saturday after Christmas to find that our apartment had been double booked. After staying in a lousy apartment we hit an internet cafe on Sunday morning and found a suite for my family of four and checked in by 1:00 that afternoon. They turned our almost disasterous holiday into a great week. The front desk team was so nice and made us feel welcome as soon as we walked in the door. As a previous review stated almost everyone except the maids spoke decent English. We spent a lot of evenings in the bar waiting for resturants to open for dinner and we were treated like family. It seemed like Delta crews use this hotel as well as other business people however because we were there over the holidays there were lots of families with young children. I don't think it is typically a family hotel but they were very good with our children even the 6 year old that kept breaking glasses in the bar.The concierge gave good resturant recommendations and even got us into a place for dinner on New Year's day when a lot of places were closed. Saved us wondering around the city looking at closed resturants.I did have a massage which was strickly OK. One complaint I have about the spa is that the massage rooms are right next to the weight room and the pool so I listened to kids playing in the pool and the sound of weights being clanged around during the massage.We ate at the hotel only on New Year's Eve and the food was suberb. They actually provided us with a kids dinner that was only about a quarter of the price of the adult meal. The internet was expensive - 鈧?2 per day. The location is about a 鈧? taxi ride to the Placa de Catalyuna and does have a good selection of resturants nearby. I was even able to find a butcher across the street and brought back some of Spain's famous ham. They shrink wrapped it for me.If you go to Barcelona and don't mind not staying in the city center - give the Melia Barcelona a look.

<Content>Will never stay at Melia Barcelona ever again! My family and I were looking for an enjoyable and relaxing holiday in Barcelona, but by far Melia Barcelona was the worst hotel we麓ve been to. We were treated so badly, staffs were so unfriendly and rude. It was also inconveniently located far from Metro, city center, restaurants, etc. For the 5 days we booked, we stayed one night, cancelled the rest of our bookings and stayed at a much nicer and better located hotel near La Rambla. I assure you, you麓re well-off staying near La Rambla than staying at this hotel.

<Content>Beautiful hotel with great restaurant The hotel is lovely with well appointed rooms--loved having a robe and slippers provided. Modern with all the usual amenities except hair conditioner (this seems to be lacking everywhere in Spain). The food in the restaurant was outstanding. Only thing that detracted from the stay was the location was not close to any of the tourist areas or shopping areas. It was about a 10 EU cab ride to the Gothic Quarter and La Rambla.

<Content>Good base in Barcelona Stayed for 2 nights Sep 2008 for a medical meeting.The hotel was clean and the room I had was large. 2 singles pushed together rather than a large queen or king bed but it was comfortable. Spent little time in the hotel as I was at a meeting @ the Conference centre each day. Location was close to the Conference centre with transfers taking less than 15 minutes each time. Seemed to be close to sites but didn't get a chance to evaluate.Large bathroom with rainshower which was lovely  good bathVery basic gym with 2 treadmills, 2 bikes and some weight machines. No-one else was there the morning I went. The pool is small but looked great. Had a massage which was relaxing and pretty good value for Europe. Room service was slow but very tasty and not that expensive.Would stay again.

<Content>Lovely stay during time of need We were in Barcelona for the start of a cruise when Mom broke her arm. We had to fly home to the US, so my corporate travel department found this hotel for a one night stay waiting for the flight home.Brand new, gorgeous, incredible staff and the concierge level rocked.Amazing rooms, awesome neighborhood.Made a bad time much better.

<Content>Good hotel; bring your money belt! I stayed at Melia Barcelona on Av de Sarria on business. When traveling for leisure I prefer a central location, which this hotel is not. For my particular trip this was fine. Las Ramblas area would have been noisy as several celebrations took place this week--Saint John鈥檚 Day (fireworks and firecrackers throughout the night), Spain defeated Russia in a soccer playoff for the Euro 2008. Going on to win the championship for the first time in over 40 years!The front desk staff were fluent in English. To use the elevators, push the number(s) for your floor. The response will be what elevator car to use. If several floors are for the same car, the floor numbers will light inside the doorway. Press 0 to return to the lobby.From the hotel to the top of Las Ramblas a taxi cost 7EUR; airport 25EUR; cruise terminal (鈥減uerto agua鈥?was the best translation that got me there) 17EUR. I did not dine in the hotel but instead opted to stock the minibar fridge with my own juice, yogurt, and fruit purchased in the basement at El Corte Ingles. ECI is several blocks away. A few blocks further was a 24 hour Internet / shipping store. One hour of Internet time cost 5EUR. There may be some places closer to the hotel but I needed a one place shop since my checked luggage didn鈥檛 arrive with me.The superior room was pleasant with a king size bed and a very high thread count bedding. The mattress was firm (not hard) and pillows soft. The amenities had a masculine fragrance for my taste. There is a separate shower and whirlpool tub.A packet and map costs 3EUR per person for the Bus Turistic www.tmb.net, then pay 17EUR on board for the tour. Either way the tour is 20EUR pp, so why not give a small commission to the hotel? I had only a short amount of leisure time and was the best way to get in a lot of sights. The pick up point for either the blue (southern) or red route (northern) is an easy 10 minute walk.TIPS: Theft alert鈥揑 personally heard from 4 different passengers on cruise ships who were victims of pickpocketing. Even a local had her purse stolen off her shoulder from a passing motorbike. Wear a money belt with your passport, credit cards, and large amounts of cash inside. Anything else should be an amount you are willing to part with or have the credit card number written somewhere so you can report it missing. Never bring your money belt out in public, you can always go to a bathroom at McDonald鈥檚 to retrieve its contents. Ladies should keep purses on their laps, never on the back of a chair or on the floor.Cruise port to town鈥揂 taxi will cost 7EUR to town (Las Ramblas). A public bus round trip is 3EUR, but get there early or resign to sharing a taxi. The walk to town is probably over two miles. Bus Turistic鈥揚ick up the red route near the hotel. The line went on forever when we tried to connect from the blue to the red route at Placa de Catalunya.All in all, I loved Barcelona. A long stay in the city would be desirable as Barcelona has so much to offer. It is easy to get around and a very walkable location. The people are warm, the food delicious, the weather was sunny and beautiful with some nice breezes.

<Content>pleasant stay, some small minuses I stayed at a hotel as i was attending a conference at the same hotel. In general the hotel was nice and clean, and with a wonderful breakfast buffet, not to mention the perfect freshly squeezed orange juice. I was staying on the 20th floor, and i could see the sea from my window (if you ignored the not-so-nice building which blocked part of the view). the room was quite small though - it was good for me alone but i am guessing that sometimes it is rented as a double, but for 2 it would be too small. But i know that other rooms were bigger, so i would not worry about this too much.What i appreciated the most was the sound-proof window. Really, hardly any noise came in and my sleep was perfect. The air conditioning was also working, but i could not really figure out how exactly it works at frst. what i was disappointed in was that breakfast staff did not speak english at all. I was looking for milk for my coffee but could not find it so i asked one of the waitresses. she was showing me this and that until i remembered the spanish word and only then she gave me that milk. Also, i was not 100% sure that the front desk understood all i asked them.Also, there was not stationary PC with internet available. I guess that most guests come with laptops and wireless was available, but what if i do not have laptop with me but i do need internet? apart from that, i am happy with my stay, the subway was nearby, the hotel was good (as far as room and breakfast is concerned), the neighbourhood ok, and i do not exclude the possibility of staying there again.

<Content>Cruise ship stop-off point We stayed here for two nights before a cruise and one night at the end. Chosen because of 5* rating and because their suite accomodated all four of us. Hotel is widely used as a stopover for cruisers. A little out of town, with a 鈧?10 taxi fare to Las Ramblas and a 鈧?45 fare for a large cab to the cruise ship (allow 鈧?25 for a standard taxi). Modern, comfortable accomodation, and helpful staff, apart from a saga where they misunderstood the word jam for ham in a sandwich. Tiny pool and a sort-of spa, for which they wanted to charge an extra 鈧?60 but then they relented. One restaurant with a very adult menu, and poor children's selection. Strictly a stop-over and not a destination hotel. Fine if booked as part of a cruise package, but not a place you would select as a base for the city.

<Content>Nice hotel but pricey Spent just one night at the Melia (and as part of a large conference group) so take this review with a grain of salt. The non-central location wasn't an issue, count 20-25EUR from the airport with off peak traffic.The room I had (a suite) was large, stylish and clean. I only spent 5 or so hours in it and three things really annoyed me. You can hear your neighbors. I was on floor 10 and traffic noise woke me up a couple of times in the early morning. It took me 20 minutes to shower given the low water pressure.I'm wondering if this is linked with the water issue currently in BCN or not. Breakfast was quite good with an impressive large buffet. Check-in and check-out went OK but the employees don't seem to care too much. Spanish nonchalance ?We had lunch at the hotel twice, and the food was quite average.The entrance is still undergoing renovations.

<Content>Lovely Melia Barcelona My husband and i spent three nights at this hotel last march and we are going back for a couple of nights these christmas. The staff are lovely and always there to help and advice with restaurants, tours, shopping etc. The hotel is a little far from Las Ramblas and the area around it but it is quiet and more upmarket and you are right in the middle of some of the most sought after residential areas in the city, plus you still have some really great restaurants and a lot of lovely shops including some spanish high street names, only without the crowds, which is a lot better. Taxis to the city centre are very cheap and the walk down to the Plaza de Espana area, even though is quite long, is a great way to take in the arquitecture and the vibe of the city, and if you fancy a break there are always plenty of bars and cafes to stop and recharge the batteries. I would recomend this hotel to couples of all ages, it is a quieter option, but really romantic and a great way to see more of Barcelona.

<Content>Off the Path, but worth the effort I was part of a 3 couple group that spent about a week in Barcelona, and a week in Lisbon. We were interested in seeing the sights, but wanted a room that could be quiet, clean, safe, and had some comfort items to suit our spouses. The Melia Barcelona was very nice, a little far from the Metro, about 5 blocks. It was very comfortable, the staff could not have been more attentive, they are very fluent in several languages. I seldom got to use my Spanish. The neighborhood had several very nice places to eat, and very nice shopping was walking distance . The on and off bus stopped just around the corner. The breakfast daily was a feast! The rooms were very nice, clean, and well provided. There was a little street noise.  Yes, I would stay there again if I return , which I might.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We stayed here for three nights from 7/5/07-7/8/07. The hotel was clean, comfortable and modern. Our room had all the amenites we could have asked for and it was tended to daily.The hotel staff was friendly, helpful and very professional in all of our dealings with them. They helped us arrange tours and told us about things to see and where to eat in the area.The breakfast buffet was excellent and had choices that would be acceptable to anyone with any type of need or restriction. Despite other reviews on this page I like the elevator and we had no problem with the operation, speed or any other aspect of the elevator system.The only drawback to the hotel was that it is not in the center of the action areas although there is easy access to these areas via public transportation and/or cabs. We felt very safe walking through the area at night. The hotel was a 20 euro cab ride from the airport and 25 euros to the port area where we met our cruise ship.We would definitely staty at this hotel again.

<Content>Very chic This was a business trip. The hotel was in the city centre but away from the tourist area of Las Ramblas. There were nice shops for shopping nearby but it was a 10 minute walk. Check in was very pleasant. The rooms were ultra modern with LCD TVs and contemporary furnishings. The view from my room was not great. Bathrooms were again, large and contemporary with a bath and shower area. Only complaint was the shower fitting was broken. Tried to use the pool but you had to pay to swim. Perhaps it is a policy in Spain. Unheard of in UK hotels with pools. Overall, still very pleasant with friendly staff.

<Content>Wonderful! Apparently this hotel is doing a complete renovation right now, floor by floor. This probably explains why some of the comments here say it needs to be renovated. We had a recently updated room and it was incredibly nice. We had a king size bed, a flat panel plasma TV, and a bathroom with a bathtub with jacuzzi jets and a shower stall that had whole-body massage and powerful jets. The hotel staff was all very helpful, the bar was very nice and the drinks very good, and the meeting facilities top notch. They had a wonderful gym (the pool is not included with the room; it's part of the spa that costs extra but it isn't a workout pool anyway). As for location, this hotel is not in the middle of tourist Barcelona, meaning areas such as Las Ramblas (which is horribly overrated anyway). It is, however, near alot of good restaurants and very close to the large pedestrian walkway of Rambla de Catalunya. It's right on Av Diagonal, which is the shopping captial street of Barcelona. Barcelona has a top-notch metro system that can take you anywhere you want to go in the city (although the stop is about a 8 minute walk from the hotel) so seeing the sites is not hard.In conclusion, this place is wonderful. The rooms are fantastic. Assuming you don't mind walking and riding the metro to seeing the sights, you're love the location. And maybe you'll see some parts of Barcelona that are not just for tourists.

<Content>Left A Lot To Be Desired I was very disappointed with this hotel. The staff at the front desk were rude. I was also unhappy with the room. I had asked for 2 beds, there were 2 twins but they were pushed together and was almost impossible to seperate. I was traveling with another lady and wasnt comfortable with the beds together. The room was very small. Bathroom was nice. I asked for a converter to use curling iron and had a lot of trouble getting one. I finally did get it.This is definitely not a 5 star hotel. I asked about a swimming pool, was told they had one but it cost $16 euros to use it. It was obviously part of a gym but they didnt convey that.We were not close to anything. Taxi rides to the pier was $20 euros. This hotel makes me think I would never go back to Barcelona. If I ever do go back, I will definitely not stay at that hotel.

<Content>Excellent room I stayed at Melia Barcelona beginning of May 2006. My room was at the 18th floor, with Jacuzzi and massage shower. It was excellent. The service I received was also excellent as well as the breakfast buffe which had an amount of choices. Was travelling in business, so I did not have time to look at the near areas. But the hotel in itself was excellent.

<Content>In need of some serious TLC... Stayed here for one night in April. Hotel location is a bit out of the way from the city core, but I was booked into this hotel for convenience of business meetings the following day. I thought this would be a good hotel based on the chain's reputation.I found the room to be depressing and outdated, with the bathroom making up for it a bit. But the overall feeling is that everything is a bit old and rundown, from the lobby to the corridors to the actual room and furnishings. The entire hotel feels like it could use a facelift. Front desk staff was courteous, but FB staff in the lobby bar and downstairs breakfast room all looked like they would rather work somewhere else.

<Content>NOT a 5*...awful location and service We went fully expecting a 5* hotel (as it's rated), but it fell far below even our lowest expectations! It's not within walking distance to tourist attractions and the surrounding area leaves much to be desired. The hotel's restaurant and room service food are poor and the decor/furnishings of standard rooms seem more like American 3 or 4* level. Then there's the service...AWFUL. When we arrived, in spite of our advanced request, my husband and I were given twin beds instead of one double bed in a nonsmoking room. Then, we spent the *whole* first day there dealing with the management because first our TV didn't work, then we found out our in-room safe was dead, and finally our bidet started leaking all over our bathroom floor! They only agreed to move us to an upgraded room after *extensive* complaining/demanding. The superior room's decor was very modern, beautiful and 5*...but it was an illusion, all flash and same problems. The safe didn't work and was irreparable(apparently, they couldn't replace it either so they offered to move us AGAIN!--plus they had no public safes at the front desk), the movies and time/alarm functions were not set-up or accessible on the TV (which was important b/c there's no alarm clock or wake-up service), and there was a flood on the bathroom floor every time you took a shower (standing with glass door). Through our dealings, we discovered that there is really no manager or concierge--only reception and a PR person who was inconsistently available and unable to fully accommodate. Reception was only marginally willing and helpful in making tour and restaurant reservations. The room service operator couldn't speak English, so we had to go through Reception to translate what we wanted to order. Plus, when we just wanted some ice for the beverages in the lukewarm refrigerator, they charged us $5 for ice. Although in Melia's Madrid hotel, they offered complementary breakfast, it was almost $30 per person at this location for the exact same buffet. The only aspect we didn't have complaints about?--the maid and maintenance staff.

<Content>Great Stay at Melia We stayed at the Melia Barcelona and arrived on a Sunday. Our room was not ready until about 2pm, they let us store our bags and off we went. The hotel itself is very large and quite beautiful, decorated in marble and comfotable sofas in the entrance. There were some tour groups staying at the hotel, starting their bus tours from there as it was announced in the main lobby on a billboard. The room was very large and did have the chain hotel feeling but it was bright and clean. The bathroom was absolutely magnificet, 2 sinks and a seperate glass door for the toilet and the bidet. The desk staff were not overly friendly but they were very nice all the same. The hotel is not walking distance to anything and we took a cab a couple of times to Las Ramblas and it cost us 6 euros each time. EVERYTHING was closed in Barcelona on a Sunday so it was a great beach day! I don't know if I would stay at the hotel again just because it's not in an area that is within walking distance of restaurants and sights.

<Content>Big, brash and gaudy...and they'll tell you they are good The Melia Barcelona is Melia's flagship hotel in Barcelona. On the map, it is close to everything, but in reality, you need to travel a good distance on the Metro and/or taxi to get anywhere.The hotel is a huge modern building, and rather than going for extra-special touches which make a five star hotel special, they have gone on an all out offensive to show you it is actually worth five stars. There is no elegance, nothing is understated; everything is big, bold and brash. And that is the approach they have taken throughout the hotel. Concierge is reasonable, but the rest of the management is very poor.The rooms are very large and very clean. Everything is run super-professionally. Twin sinks in the bathrooms, huge beds, well-appointed rooms, but very very sterile, not romantic at all and big bold statements, like big and brash five star motifs over the beds.The bar and restaurant staff are good. The staff made us club sandwiches very late one night after everything had closed for the night. Breakfast is poor, and tapas bars around aren't great either - you need to walk for 10-15 minutes for better dining places. When we were checking out, the lady who dealt with us was very rude and checked our rate three times and kept us waiting for 10 minutes while she checked it again, despite our assurances and booking confirmation from expedia. She even suggested we could have produced the booking confirmation ourselves...though she could not explain why it was on their computer system. And then, she did not apologise and just ignored us and kept silent while processing our payment.The hotel is also on a street where there are many prostitutes late at night, and they do harrass you quite a bit when you are trying to walk back to the hotel in peace in the evening (not even that late on).If you want a big brash hotel, go for it, especially at a cheap rate, otherwise, think twice.

<Content>So So Melia Barcelona compares favorably vs other 4 star hotels in Barcelona. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The waiters at the bar made us sandwiches at 2am, as we were starving after a delayed EasyJet flight from London. Although the hotel was far away from the main tourist areas, we found it very easy to commute everywhere as taxis were very cheap. I would definitely stay there again if I get a good rate for a short city break. However, I would not recommend it for a romantic escape/anniversary etc.

<Content>Business hotel Good business hotel location. Not for the tourist its far from the main core. Shopping nearby is so-so. Breakfast at the hotel is good. Room needs to be remodeled.

<Content>Nice Hotel, So-So location The Sol Melia is a nice hotel - gorgeous lobby - but not what I would rate a five-star ... more like a four-star... the room was very small - two beds pushed together with no space in between (a twin room, this was)... bathroom was nicer than the bedroom. It seemed to be much more geared toward business travelers than tourists... The hotel's about a 5-euro taxi ride to all the best things in Barcelona, i.e. Las Ramblas. The best thing about it was the terrific buffet breakfast, which was included in our package. That was really an added plus... If it wasn't so far away from the hub of things, I'd stay there again...

<Content>Nothing special The Melia claims to be a 5* hotel but falls short by some way. It has few facilities and the rooms are comfortable but nothing special. The staff are friendly and helpful but not very efficient. My early morning wake up call (at 5.15am for an early flight to the UK) never came, and the excuse was that the automatic system had broken down - but there appeared to be no back up. My complaint was met with a shrug of the shoulders. Location is out of the centre but convenient for buses to all directions. The nearest Metro is about 10 minutes walk. I would not stay there by choice again.

<Content>Pleasant stay but lack facilities Hotel is located a little out of the main city area (taxis are cheap), but we had a good view from the room on the 21st floor. Hotel interior is well done, top marks for bed  bedding, but we were terribly disappointed after checking in to realise the gym and sauna were closed for the weekend. Hotel staff are friendly, but there were some problems with language as staff didn't speak good english. We had to also ask twice for more shower gel to be delivered to the room. Claimed to be 5*, I wouldn't give it more than 4. Also no personal hotel car park, and paid 40 euros for parking 2 days in a public car park.
