<Content>Very comfortable stay I stayed here in May 2008. I wouldn't normally stay in a hotel of this quality but I left it very late to book so it was the cheapest get. I paid 鈧?00 per night for a very large suite, which was very comfortable and quite good value, but probably more luxury than I needed. The location is only ok for two reasons: one is it's not in the very centre of the city, so you end up having to travel by metro or taxi more than if you were in the centre; two the street the hotel is on is very busy and quite noisy (I got woken up by traffic and had to wear earplugs but I am quite a light sleeper). There is a really nice cafe nearby at Placa Espanya with a very friendly Argentine waitress and good coffee (hard to find in Spain!).The room itself was beautiful and very modern comfortable. The staff were excellent, helpful and friendly.One thing to watch out for are the badly designed windows - I nearly fell out trying to open mine (seriously!). There's a notice beside the window recommending not to open it, so I guess I'm not the first guest who had trouble with it. Not so nice when you're on the 6th floor. :-)Certainly nothing wrong with this hotel - apart from the location. But probably a bit fancier than my needs, so I probably wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>cant recommend highly enough a great hotel, only complaint i'd have is that some of the front rooms are subject to street noise, but it was only ever a minor irritation.staff were excellent, very friendly and accomodating.their apartment rooms were very comfortable, and extremely reasonable for what you get.great location too, handy for the metro and right beside montjuic, which is an absolute must-see. also the surrounding neighbourhoods are quiet and pleasant, very traditional.two thumbs up!p.s this also deserves a mention, out of 4 hotels i stayed in in barcelona, this hotel was the only one who's internet connection was both free (in other places the standard seems to be 22euro per 24h), and worked properly.
