<Content>Quaint place on the outskirts of Downtown Stayed there on a weekend when it was impossible to find a room in Seattle. It was a bit high priced, $160 after taxes, but it wasn't that bad at all. Doing my research I found that this building used to be an apartment building turned hotel/inn. The rooms are very apartment like and was very surprised at the size of the room! (Room 811). There was construction around the inn, but none going on during our stay on a Saturday night. The air conditioning faired well, and the very old TV served us well in the morning. The elevator is not as rickety as described. The hill is a bit steep, but if you're younger it's do-able. Very close to Pike Market and close to Seattle Center, the Space Needle is a short Monorail ride away. I quite enjoyed my stay at the Virgina Mason Inn!!

<Content>Not pleased Although the location was very convenient (a 10-15 minute downhill walk to Pike Place Market), this hotel was dissapointing. We had just come off the I-5 after a HOT day of driving and there was no air conditioning, which was not mentioned on the website. There was a note on the window asking that we leave windows closed as there were renovations going on at the hospital 20 feet away from the hotel, also not mentioned on the website. We had to wait for the ancient elevator to go up one floor because the stairwells were closed due to renovations going on in the hotel...again, not mentioned on the website. The room we had was very old, dingy and smelled stale, and there were dried drips and spots on the bathroom walls. Construction went on until at least 7pm and started again at 6:30am. Both available parking garages were located down a very steep hill. These things should be taken into consideration for people staying there for medical reasons. The desk staff were very good at apologizing.

<Content>Nice Hotel -- Would certainly return My wife and I stayed here for a few days last summer while we were on vacation. It's located about seven blocks (up some very steep hills) from the water front. It's perhaps about 3/4 of a mile from downtown and located in a quiet neighborhood. We chose this hotel because of its proximity to downtown and its price. When you walk in the lobby is nice, staff are friendly. It turned out a number of rooms were available and the woman at the front desk talked us through which room we'd like based on the view. The room was really large. There was even a changing area adjacent to the bathroom. The room had a fantastic view of downtown Seattle and the waterfront. The Hotel is attached to a hospital that bears the same name. Many of the people staying there were clearly there for medical reasons. It's for that reason why I would slightly hesitate to recommend the hotel to leisure travelers. Having said that, it's really nice inside, and you'd never know it was attached to a hospital if you didn't see the signs directing you to where the hospital is.

<Content>Confusing reservations, great stay! I had a horrible time trying to find a hotel at the last minute for a wedding in Seattle in July. However, I finally stumbled upon the Inn at Virginia Mason/Baroness Hotel website. I called the location directly after seeing favorable reviews on TripAdvisor. The booking process was very confusing since the Baroness Hotel was cheaper but is actually recently bought by and operated by the Inn at Virginia Mason. Finally, I arranged a queen apartment for $135 per night with tax in the Baroness.There is no free shuttle to the hotel from the airport so make your own arrangements. If you take the bus, it will drop you off at the bottom of a HUGE hill and you will have to hike quite a ways up. I did the Express Shuttle. Upon arrival, I got a key but had to lug my bags from the front desk to the other lobby across the street. There is a cozy little reading room at the Baroness with a fireplace and comfy couches. Up an old fashioned elevators, I got to my room. It was a bit stuffy since the hotel doesn't have a/c. But I opened the window, put on the fan provided and it cooled down nicely. The room was complete with a fully furnished kitchen (microwave, oven, stove, fridge, pots, pans, utensils, plates, etc.), dining room table  chairs, a living area with a big couch, armchair and footstool, cable tv and lots of lamps. The bedroom had loads of closet space, a dressing table, a queen sized bed with plenty of clean sheets and pillows. The bathroom was small and only provided soap and towels. No shampoo or condition or lotion. There is a hairdryer but you have to pick it up and return it to the front desk. Same goes for an iron. Overall, the staff was pleasant but not overly helpful when needed. I did not eat at the restaurant but it looked very cozy. We chose to cook in our room two out of three nights which definitely saved money in the long run. You are literally five minutes from the downtown area by foot. I did not mind the walk back up the from downtown. It works off the good food from the restaurants! There is also a great market two blocks away, a good (but pricey) diner around the corner with great coffee and the Sorrento hotel for cocktails and jazz at night. So you're very well located here. I would recommend this hotel to budget travelers, couples looking for a big place, business travelers and families.

<Content>Quiet and Cheap This was a decent, quiet little hotel. Given that it was one of the cheapest we could find in the city, I should be giving it a much higher rating. The rooms were clean and the air conditioning decent (this was important given the heat wave we encountered). It is conveniently located a short walk from downtown. Athough as has been mentioned there's an incredibly steep hill you'll have to climb if you want to walk back. Okay neighbourhood, we never felt insecure about walking around at night. The staff were very friendly upon arrival and were able to give us information on local events and attractions. We only spent one night here and didn't try the restaurant. The rest of our stay in Seattle we rented a small studio/cottage on Bainbridge Island for only $150/night (highly recommended as the prices are cheaper than in Seattle and it's only a 30 min, $6 return ferry ride right downtown)

<Content>Charm plus cardio--how can you miss? If you arrive in downtown Seattle via public transportation, the first thing you'll notice about Virginia Mason is the hike up First Hill. (I'd told the kids to pack light.) Though the Inn seemed a bit too out of the way initially, I was grateful for the location when evening arrived and the huge SeaFair parade began weaving through downtown. We were able to walk to most of the attractions in Seattle from the hotel: downhill to the waterfront, over to the Space Needle, back to Pioneer Square. Though the kids complained about the lack of a pool, the room itself was spacious and clean, with a bathroom big enough for a small party and enough beds to accommodate our family of six. The staff was pleasant and accommodating, plus the place felt cozy--a pleasant contrast to the chains where we spent most of our vacation.

<Content>Great room, but don't count on it! We reserved room 611 for the nights of July 25-26, 2005. We arrived on 7-25 as expected and found our room waiting. It was nice, clean and comfortable. My wife was having brain aneurism surgery on the morning of 7-26, so we left early. My son had driven in that morning and we were going to use the same room that night. He was replacing my wife as she was in ICU. At 11:45 am we called to make sure the room was available and we were told it was all ready for us.That evening we left the ICU and got back to the room about 10:30 PM. We immediately found someone else in our room (611). The desk was very helpful and tried to find us a room in another hotel to no avail. A lady assisted the clerk and located a room in the hotel that no one was using (604). We waited for it to be cleaned. She came back and said she would 'comp' the room to us for the night of 7-26 since they had given our original room away. She then said they would hold that room for us since my wife was to be released on 7-27 and the hospital wanted us to stay in Seattle one more night before returning to our home in Spokane, Wa. We would pay for the 2nd night in room 604.My wife was released from ICU at 7:30 PM. We started for our room, but just to be safe, I called ahead only to learn that it too had been given to someone else during the day. The same lady that had saved it for us was the one I talked to. Again, she was very nice and apologized, but we had no room. We were asked to come over and they would see if there was anything they could do about locating something else since they were full. At this point with my wife hurting and in need of a place to stay, we decided to head east toward home and see if we could locate something else which we finally did...in Ellensburg. Fool me once, shame on you...Fool me twice, shame on me!

<Content>great visit I stayed at the Inn at Virginia Mason while completing some continuing education in the area November 28 - 29, 2004. The staff was excellent and the restaurant, also. The rates were very competetive for the area. A quaint, lovely, little hotel I would highly recommend.

<Content>The Inn is convenient I stayed at the Inn at Virginia Mason before and after surgery. The staff was very kind and helpful. The on-site restaurant was good and service was excellent. The room was small, especially the bathroom, but the price was very reasonable. Parking is extra but convenient. I would stay there again, since it was very quiet. Just what a post surgery patient needed.

<Content>A Great Seattle Hideway My wife and I stayed at the Inn mid-Spring and were delighted with the hotel and services. We wanted to be near downtown but not in the city center and the Inn fit the bill to a T. The 80 room hotel sits atop First Hill, in a quiet neighborhood of historic mansions, cathedrals, medical centers and tree-lined streets. Just a few blocks walk to the city core. It looks like a boutique European hotel, brick building with a colorful awning, flower-boxes and polished brass everywhere, a cozy lobby, a great cafe for all three meals (we ate dinner there) and courtyard. The staff is more than terrific - from the desk staff to the cafe servers, its evident they enjoy working there and are great concierges for the city. The rooms are nice and are very fairly priced. The housekeeping is immaculate. The suites (we didn't stay in one but toured several) are very nice and two are on the top floor where there is an open terrace for a terrific view of the city. We'll stay in the fireplace suite on our next visit to Seattle. A real neat spot. Highly recommended.
