<Content>Awful I had stayed at the Garden Hotel in the 1990s and in the early part of 2000. At that time is was good value for money and fairly comfortable.When I stayed there in March 2006, it was an awful experience. The breakfast was the worst buffet that I have evey had and I mean ever.I was visiting family, so I would get up in the morning and not return until late at night. The carpet in the room was stained and old. I did not like walking on it in my bare feet ... The staff were polite but you could see they were used to people complaining.The pool was actually green with alge I do not think it was safe to swim in. I love to swim so this was a big dissapointment to me.I was only in the hotel for 2 days and I had paid upfront so stuck it out.I left the hotel feeling depressed and looking forward to getting home. There are some lovely hotel in Singapore so its a shame that this one was in such a state.

<Content>stay elsewhere! Just stay away. I spent 7 days there and would have shifted hotels if I hadn't pre-paid- other tourists with me left for the YMCA after 1 night. I had to wait 2 hours for my room to be ready and I got to the hotel at 10am! They told me to enjoy a beakfast while waiting, which I did, then was charged full price for. The room was dark, dingy and not worth (then) $80 a night, and it's a hike to Orchard Rd past the lovely Goodwood Park (which I should have stayed at). One night I ordered a bland room service and the used dishes and tray sat outside my room for FOUR days! The front desk staff were supremely unhelpful during check in and at check out wanted to slug me with $5 SGD 'connection' fees when I called home (and no-one picked up). I refused, and it shaved a good $50 SGD off my phone bill. Stay somewhere better like the Phoenix.

<Content>Unpleasant experience! I was terribly upset with the services, the room, the breakfast and everything about it. I booked for a king size bed but when I checked-in, they gave me a twin bedroom instead because they were out of king beds, REFUSED to do anything about and they were rude. My stay was prepaid so I couldn't back out otherwise it will be forfeited. Bellboy actually waited by our door for us to tip him before he left. Breakfast was awful, it looked like food served at a camp site. Room was old and smelly. This hotel is definitely the worst hotel services without a smile.

<Content>Wasted money Garden hotel is dirty and smelly, there is a musty horrible smell on entering this hotel and the smell didn't get any better working our way up from the lifts, to the room. The hallway has a lot of water damage to the walls and carpets which are in total disrepair, I guess this is responsible for a lot of the musty smell. The curtains are filthy and the one chair in the room was filthy as was the carpet and cockroaches in the bathroom, fortunately the sheets looked ok. This is a standard I would expect in a third world country for around $30.00 a night not SINGAPORE. S$180.00 per night for the type of accommodation offered is extremely overpriced. My mind boggles at what I would get for $100.00 in Singapore. I didn't know this standard existed in Singapore. On a brighter note the bell boy was very friendly and helpful and the ladies behind the reception were polite.

<Content>Smelling Hotel, Dirty Carperts, Uncourteous Staff 1) Hotel Corridors Carpets and Hygiene need attention.2) Rooms not properly lit. Most of the fittings either out of order and not maintained properly.Electrical Sockets for making tea etc. found not functional. 3) We had checked out of the room No. 302 on the noon of 7th June, 2007, as per their advice whereas our return flight was at 11.00 PM. They had assured that assistance would be provided for change over in the evening prior to leaving for Airport late in the evening since your driver was suppossed to pick us up from the Hotel at 8.00 PM. On our return from the Market after shopping we were told to either shift the luggage, which was handed over to the security in the morning at about 10.30, to take the same to the fifth floor outselves and do unpacking/packing there or on the ground floor, near the Bar on the ground floor. The bar incharge, an elderably gentleman of about 50 years of age, told us to complete the packing/unpacking within 5/6 minutes and leave the corridor. With great difficulty, we were able to shift the luggage from near the front office to the Corridor near the Bar and complete the process in about 10 minutes. The Bar Incharge was very sarcastic and made uncalled for racist remarks about Indian Standard Time and punctuality.Another assistance of the Bar Incharge wanted us to carry the Heavy weight trolley and luggage outselves from Front office to the Corridor without appreciating the fact that both me and wife are aged around 57 and 65 years of age and I being a Heart Patient with a Stent carrying in my both had clear instructions from the Doctor not to carry heavy weight at all was put to lot of inconvenience by the Bar Incharge and his assistant.

<Content>Badly maintained hotel with lousy service I was really dissapointed with our travel agents selection of Garden Hotel. Looks like it may have been a good hotel when it started out but it has not been maintained at all since then. The rooms smell musty. The walls have water leakages and the carpets look like they have not been cleaned for years. The same goes for the curtains. The hotel is rated 3 stars but I wouldn't even think it was 1 star. The taps in the bathroom leak and the bathroom is so dirty and shabby. The housekeeping staff seem to be just changing the sheets and towelsand not cleaning the room at all. The buffet breakfast was not up to the mark. The management seems to be not interested at all in providing service. The attendants who were to take our luggage downstairs at the time of checkout were rude enough to tell us to hurry up as they had several checkouts that day. The captain / manager at the reception was extremely rude and lacked any kind of etiquette. He needs to be pulled up by his superiors for this though we didn't complain about him. All in all, we were given a raw deal in Garden Hotel though the pricing of the rooms was reasonable, the service and upkeep of the hotel didn't make it worthwhile. I would not recommend this hotel to any one and would advise you not to be taken up by the pics on their site. Its better to pay a little more and get a better place to stay in S'pore than Garden Hotel.

<Content>Jaded but still good. This was my second time at the Garden Hotel. The first was ten years ago and the old place hasn't changed much! The taxi driver told me that it was one of the swishest hotels in Singapore when it first opened, which I would guess would have been in the sixties. It's one of those slightly sad hotels that was obviously top of the range once, but hasn't had any money spent on it since the day it opened. Having said that, it's pleasant enough and I would be very happy to stay there again. My room was an excellent size and had a nice view overlooking the swimming pool. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Given the low price (拢28) I paid for my one night stopover, I was surprised to find that a very good buffet breakfast was included. The location is a little bit away from the major hotels in downtown and from Orchard Road, but in a pleasant and quiet residential area. Transport is really no problem as there is an MTR station about ten minutes walk away, or alternatively, taxis in Singapore are inexpensive. I'd definitely recommend the Garden. It's got everything I would want at a third of the price or less, of the big name places in the city centre.

<Content>Great for the price We stayed at the Garden on our way home from 2 months backpacking around Eastern Europe. I agree with some of the comments made in the previous review. The hotel looked like a 'throw-back' to the early 90's. The carpet in the halls was not great and the furnishings looked as though they had seen much better days. BUT we enjoyed our stay. The rooms were big, the staff very friendly and the breakfast choice was basic but huge. It included 3 types of cereal, toast, pasteries,fruit, baked beans, eggs, hash browns, sausages, fried rice or a noodle dish, tea, coffee, 2 types of juice.Considering the price and the closeness to Orchard road, this hotel is okay. If you like a hotel that has staff to do everything for you, including opening doors, then is not the hotel you should choose. But if you like to have your own space but be able to access satff as you need them, then this is just the place.We also enjoyed the roof top pool, which was quiet.

<Content>Falling apart Very disappointed with this hotel considering it is rated 3 stars. Then again it is self rated :P The hotel is falling apart with water dripping from the ceiling, the carpeting obviously needs to be replaced as it is worn out and stained from all the wetness. I have my doubts as to whether the rooms have ever been vacuumed properly, as I suspect the cleaners just change the sheets and replace items in the bathroom, as well as removing any -obvious- eyesores like hair. I was astounded with the lack of management in the hotel. One room on the 4th floor had finished room-service food left outside its door, but it was untouched during the 4 days I stayed there. Shows how grotty the food and service there is! i give them credit for the buffet as it really was indeed nice food. BUT on my last day at the hotel, they ran out of food for the buffet breakfast! The cook had to come out to the dining area himself and bring out more bread, fruits etc, which was just hidden behind a counter. Why did the waiters and waitresses not bring it out themselves?? then the cook had to go back inside and fry up some rice for the 10's of ppl who had just arrived to see empty plates of food. Truly terrible hotel, you can do better!

<Content>beware Stayed there on a 3 day 2 night package from manila. The rooms were big enough but wet and musty smelling. Dining area was good and food not so bad but you end of taking a package deal beware they try to sell you about everything. They do have a shuttle every hour to the shopping area which is good if you try to walk there better get your tennis shoes ready. Singapore is very expensive surprised me since im from usa but you can find some deala.

<Content>No the best This is an ok enough place if you just need to sleep somewhere for a night or two and don't want to pay a lot for it. For longer periods or special ocassions (I was there for Christmas- a mistake) you're better off paying a bit more for a better place. Yes, during the 2 weeks I was there there were a few cockroaches. Whole place smelled musty/funny but I put it down to carpeting and general humid funk. Carpets in room and in hallway suffering from mildew (to be expected in that kind of constant humidity...really what is anyone thinking having carpeting in a climate like singapore where mould is to be expected on everything!?)If you order room service they don't tend to pick up plates etc until next day (perhaps helping to attract the cockroaches). I needed to see a doctor during my stay and asked at the front desk for advice/assistance as to how to do that (as the card in the room advises you to do) but the clerk didn't have any idea how to help me (eventually sorted it out on my own, but could have used the help).Air conditioning makes room too cold (not very good variable settings) and not having it on makes it too uncomfortable.TV only has about 3 (dull) stations and no in-room movies as it written. In two weeks never encountered this mysterious courtyard pool they mention, the rooftop one is small and a bit dirty but passable. Exercise room is a joke- two or three broken pieces of equipment in a stifling shoebox of a room on the roof. This shopping arcade they mention is a bit of a mystery too.Atrium breakfast area somewhat dirty, plastic lawn chairs for furniture and wobbly tables, same food every day but it is edible.....Cleaning ladies quite smiley and nice, but slow.I get the feeling that the bedspread was not changed between guests, which is a bit creepy-although sheets were changed for me. Carpets were not hoovered during my stay- didnt like that as floor was dirty.Bathroom ok and water pressure in shower good (if you have long hair this is a consideration).

<Content>Loved the hospitality! Contrary to the cockroach scare, me and my sister never saw one in our room or in any part of the hotel. The hotel looks old with old-fashioned curtains but it's generally clean and cozy. We appreciate the concierge, the dining crew for attending to our endless queries. You guys definitely gave us a very good impression of Singapore. Definitely, our next trip there will again be spent in Garden Hotel!

<Content>thoughts on Garden Hotel We recently visited Garden Hotel in Singapore with friends, despite the worrying review of some travellers to this hotel.The hotel indeed does need updating, but offers good value for money. Our room had clean sheets and clean towels. We found the staff very helpful. We found no cockroaches in our room - there was one in the hallway however. Would revisit.

<Content>Stayed and No Regret! I was REALLY WORRIED when i read the reviews, ....however since I needed 2 rooms (4 adults, 2kids) ASAP, therefore tried my luck, took the risk and surprisingly was VERY HAPPY with Garden Hotel. Enjoyed my 4 nights stay, got the connecting rooms at level 4, room reasonable size for 2 adults and 2 kids,hourly shuttle to scotts road, orchard road and suntec city,which is very convenient,staff was friendly and helpful, breakfast was ok...no complaint...you can swim at the roof top....with good view, which I did. The only thing is the TV, not that clear....but not a problem, since you won't be in the room all the time...Overall, would recommend to others, try it!!

<Content>For Cockroach Enthusiasts If you like cockroaches then this is the hotel for you 鈥?We swapped from one room to another and so on and only to find more and more crispy crawlers. Avoid this place! A shabby, mouldy, dirty and smelly experience 鈥?No wonder though, they are tearing it down very soon!

<Content>You get what you pay for. Checking was smooth on a Friday,but a request for a late checkout on Sunday was denied, as the hotel was fully booked for the weekend.I requested a room facing the garden, but only the ground floor units were available, meanining that anyone having meals in the cafe would be able to see you go in and out of your room. There is not much of a view from the ground floor, even though there was a slight elevation.Our standard deluxe room had rattan furniture, (online photos showed better furniture :( )the sheets were clean, Although websites showed a hairdrier as part of the in-room facilitires, there wasn't one in our room.It is a 12 minute *brisk* walk to the Newton MRT station (not advisable during warm/sunny weather)The shuttle service from the hotel is good, (it departs every hour to Orchard Road)Breakfast was simple, but sufficient.

<Content>bad hotel experience garden hotel was a very unfriendly place. we were told to wait for more than an hour because the reservation officer was having lunch and we were not on the list. we were very tired from a long flight. when i got mad, that's the time they called the reservation officer.the room was not clean and with foul smell. they will lend hair dryer at 7am, not earlier. breakfast is served 7am and sometimes past 7am already. we were at the hotel for 5 nights and breakfast was the same all throughout our stay. they only have 1 fruit in the buffet, watermelon!staff were very, very unfriendly. they would frown at you even with a slightest request such as clear out your table. moreover, you cannot walk around the hotel since it's far from the busy district.their facilities look ancient. pool was not clean, and no more light at 8pm.terrible hotel.

<Content>Very disappointing We stayed in the Garden Hotel last year for 4 nights!! We had booked maninly because it was low rise (only 3 floors) and had 2 swimming pools. What a disappointment! neither of the pools was fit to swim in, they looked dirty and the area around was unkempt. The 'gym' consisted of a broken exercycle, near the swimming pool.Our room was drab and very basic and the restaurant left a lot to be desired! The staff were friendly and helpful.It was pretty handy for Orchard road, but then so were a lot of other hotels, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

<Content>economy hotel I have stayed this hotel on March 5-7,05 , this is economy hotel which is good for people who need to avoid the noisy location, although a little bit far fm the public transportation but hotel still provide the shuttle bus which is more convience. Services is ok but the airconditioning vent is full of fluff which suppose should be proper cleaned. Overall is ok and good as the room rate and location.

<Content>Avoid at all costs Extremely disappointing, reviews pictures and information about this hotel were all misleading and inaccurate.We could not get out of this hotel fast enough.Room had a very strong mildew odour and was badly water damaged.Carpets were torn, airconditioning vents were full of dust. There was algal growth on interior walls. Overall this hotel would be a health hazard, particularly for people who suffer from respiratory problems.Hotel was generally of a very poor standard. I would not contemplate staying there.Pay a bit more and stay elsewhere. We did !

<Content>Not for the health concious We stayed in this hotel (for approx 3 hours) in December 2004.If you want a modern, clean hotel, the garden hotel is not for you.This is a very old hotel which is destined for demolition, in fact the hotel was to be demolition in 2004.The rooms are large but they smell of mould. There are water stains on carpets and walls. carpets are torn, airconditioning vent in our room was full of fluff and dust. The shower screens were stained with mould.The hotel is a health hazard, particularly for people who suffer from respitory illnesses.Once we saw the state of this hotel and our rooms we immediately checked out.I could not stay in this hotel.
