<Content>Stillish and Chic but oh too, too warm....!! My husband and I have just returned from a 5 day stay at the InnSide Hotel in Berlin. We were in Berlin over the Xmas Holidays and returned home on New Year's Eve.Whilst this hotel is very stylish, chic and very clean we did experience only minor problems. Mainly the heat!!The hotel room was too hot and we had to push the window wide open even though it was below zero outside! The bed squeaked badly whenever you moved around. The gym was very disappointing with very little in the way of equipment and also the heat was on full-blast. The corridors were dark and you needed to put the light back on if you were walking through. It was like a maze to find the hotel rooms - more a fault in the design of the hotel. The hotel is built around a courtyard which in the summer I imagine is quite pretty. The hotel is also located next too some Conference Facilities but as this was in the middle of the Christmas and New Year period, this was not in use. I imagine during any other time of the year, this is quite full of business people.The hotel room was very nicely layed out but a bit office-ish with a large desk and a set of drawers like you find at work!! The shower was uber-trendy. Word of caution - do not go to this hotel and stay in a room who you are not intermit with. It is a glass cubicle in the centre of the room!! Literally! Not sure if all the rooms are like this but the picture on the web-site indicates so.The breakfast was of good variety with plenty of topping up of the buffet table though the staff did struggle as the hotel was fully-booked. So much so, guests had to eat breakfast in the bar area - and that was smokey. But it was so hot in the breakfast area!! Indeed in the winter you do tend to dress slightly warmer than if you are on a summer holiday but it was too hot to eat in comfort. We had 1 drink in the hotel bar on arrival and found this very expensive and never returned. The lobby area was also well heated - so the cold hit really hard when you walked outside.The hotel is located 5 min walk from the train/metro station and connections are very regular. 5 min ride to Alexanderplatz. Though we pretty much walked our way around Berlin, we used the metro to get us to our starting point each day. Not much going on in the area but very quiet with a few shops, a department store, a Netto and a small market in the square.Overall, a good hotel but please turn the heat to a lower setting and very clean. The staff very much German and to-the-point!!

<Content>Expensive for nothing Well.. it was really expensive for what we've got.A really small room and an even bigger problem with no air conditioning. (We were told that no room has any).Another problem was that I was travelling with my friend and there's no bathroom door so it was really awkward for us...The location on the other hand, is amazing. Just outside OstBahnhof with quick transportation everywhere in Eastern Berlin.

<Content>Very nice, modern hotel! I just got back from Berlin with my fiance and a couple of friends. We booked this hotel through a website that offered 3 rooms and tickets to the Berlin soccer team's weekend game. We really weren't sure of what to expect because the price was quite cheap but we ended up being very surprised to having recieved a very nice hotel room. The hotel seems very new and the rooms were very clean, spacious, and modern. I was very impressed by this because most hotels in Europe are a little on the small and older side. The hotel is also only about 200 meters from the east train station so you have direct access to almost anywhere in Berlin from there. The only problems I would say we had was that the reception people were not the friendliest by far. Also I would recommend skipping the dinner at the hotel restaurant. They served a very good buffet breakfast but the dinner was over priced and not very tasty at all. But that was ok because we weren't forced to eat there so we just had dinner out on the town. So after all this I would recommend this hotel and would probably go back.

<Content>good experience, be realistic about gym I ended up staying at the Innside through a lastminute.com package and was quite satisfied with the hotel.My single room was very nicely decorated, looked new, the heating was warm and the overall feel was clean, trendy and comfortable. Absolutely no problems with the bed or shower/bath and the room was a decent size. I notice there was a door leading next door so you could book two adjoining rooms if you wanted to.Location: when you get off at Ostbahnhof station exit on the north side. To your left you will see a Dresdner Bank building. The hotel is in that building but you need to walk around to the north side to get in. Basically it's five minutes walk. I walked through the area at about 5am and it was a bit spooky but there were a number of all night diner places next to the station.Look up the hotel's website which has directions how to get to the hotel from different airports around Berlin.It takes about 5 mins by the fast elevated train service to get to Alexanderplatz and about 15 minutes to the Zoo. The journey to/from Tegel airport is about 45 mins.Shopping: there is a big department store right outside the station and there are also 2 supermarkets and a drug store, cash machines, fast food joints in the station building itself. For general shopping I recommend catching the train over to the west Berlin surburb of Charlottenburg where you can find a great range of high street shops.One of the reasons I chose Innside was because the description of facilities said there was a fitness centre on-site. Well that turned out to be a bit of a disappointment - basically there is a step machine, exercise bike, gliding machine and an abs frame plus a set of free weights and a bench. Enough for a maintenance workout but dont expect to add any muscle while you are there. Also in the fitness area is a sauna and a solarium which costs about 6 euro for 30 mins.On the map it says there is a swimming pool a block near to the hotel, I didnt go myself but handy to know if you need to exercise while on vacation like me.Basically, a good experience at a good price.

<Content>Fabulous design hotel Booked the Innside Residence as part of a three day trip through Lastminute.com. We two couples have done a number of city breaks over the last couple of years and can honestly say that this hotel was the best we have encountered for the money. The design features are stunning and the rooms were spotlessly clean and really comfortable. The staff were helpful and polite and the breakfast was really good with a fabulous selection of fruits, cereals, nuts, breads, cakes, cold cuts as well as the hot buffet. We were slightly concerned when we got off the train from the airport at Ost Banhoff because the general area is a bit run down and looks a bit seedy but we did not encounter any problems. One tip we got from a volunteer at the Schonefeld airport train station was that two couples travelling together can get a group-ticket for just over 14 euros a day and this entitles the group to travel to (or from) the airport and all over Berlin on all forms of transport, what a bargain! Incidentally, don't bother to get the airport shuttle to the airport train station unless you've got loads of luggage, it's only a five minute walk. The trains run very regularly and it's a comfortable trip which only takes about half an hour. In fact the whole of Berlin's public transport system is so efficient when compared to London, there's no problem getting anywhere. There was a really good antique fair outside OstBanhoff station on the Sunday morning but I don't know if this is a regular thing. Wonderful bargains to be had if you've got enough room in your suitcase.

<Content>great advantages for the budget traveler This hotel, a beautifully converted late-19th-century hotel and part of a chain, has great advantages for the budget traveler. The rooms are spacious, scrupulously clean and well maintained, with more chairs and reading lamps than most hotels have, sleek bathroom features, and a handy mini-kitchen. It is half a block from the Galleria Kaufhof, a big department store with an excellent food department. We made our own breakfasts as well as some (very simple) dinners. The staff are young, bright, and informative; the front desk often offers apples or cookies at the end of the day. The hotel is in East Berlin, very near the Ostbahnhof, where a number of S-Bahn lines converge, so it's convenient for getting around (Alexanderplatz is a couple of stops away). The Ostbannhof also has, either inside or across the street, a wide array of fast-food places, bakeries, fruit-and-vegetable stands, and the like. The neighborhood is an expectedly dreary example of an East Berlin residential area; the advantage of this is that you see ordinary Berliners trudging home with their groceries, kids on an outing from a day-care center, and other such details of local life. Some people would prefer to be in a more trendy, hopping part of town, which is why I didn't opt for excellent. Most of the guests are business people, but on weekends Germans arrive for brief holidays.

<Content>reasonable last-minute choice We booked kind of late, but were pleasantly surprised by Innside. The room was cramped but clean...interesting decor. The immediate surroundings are nothing special, but many will appreciate the Friedrichshain neighborhood east of the hotel, perhaps the most vibrant part of Berlin. The walk over to the Friedrichshain is intriguing...this part of town is not short on Cold War-era bulwarks. The other major advantage of Innside is its proximity to the Ostbahnhof metro and train station, a huge hub...this comes in very handy considering Berlin's massive area.

<Content>Great stylish hotel..... I stayed inthis hotel for 3 nights, the hotel was fantastic, really clean spacious rooms. Our room overlooked the courtyard and the rooom was just lovely and the shower pod was amusing!!!The only thing i was a bit dissapointed in was the fact that it was not in walking distance of any of the lively places. But this did not end up being a problem as the train staion was literally around the corner and it only took a few mins to get to Alexandarplatz which was great. I think the hotel was fab and it was so beautiful.

<Content>excellent! I booked this hotel through lastminute.com, which promised a 4 star hotel for a bargain price and I wasn't dissappointed.this is a seruously cool hotel with ace decor and fantastic rooms - ours had abstract art as a headboard and a huge shower in the middle of the room.Most rooms have a mini kitchen which was good for storing beers and food and the rooms were pretty big and airy.The staff were helpful with directions from the airport and let us leave our luggage there until check in and were helpful and polite during our stay.The sauna and fitness facilites were good as was the bar - the only thing i would say wasn't the best was the fact we had to request tea bags three times - british people are obsessed with tea hehe.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We stayed in the Inn-Side hotel in Berlin for 4 days during October 2004. It鈥檚 a fantastic hotel with large, clean rooms. However, the hotel is made extra-special by the modern design touches throughout.The location is perfect 鈥?don鈥檛 let the fact that its in the Eastern part of the city put you off. Alexanderplatz is perfectly walkable, and in any case the Ostbahnof station is less than a minute away, so travel to the Western parts is only a 10 minute train ride (and trains seems to leave every 2 minutes鈥?.Overall, I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to go back to this hotel.

<Content>Cutting edge design A blend of the old (the building used to be a textile factory) with the new (21st century shower pod) make this an unusual place to stay. Only 2 minutes walk from Ostbahnhof and 5 from the East Side Gallery, with service of the sort you don't expect in Germany, and a good restaurant thrown in, this is a real find. Great value for money if you get a deal.
