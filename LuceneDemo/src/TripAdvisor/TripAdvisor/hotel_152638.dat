<Content>A favorite It's loud and a little bit funky but it's majestic! The views onto the zocolo will stay with me forever, especially at dusk. The din is incredible but I got used to it.

<Content>Worth a Stay The location of this hotel can't be beat. It also contributes to the noise, bring earplugs and/or ask for an interior room. The rooms are dated and could use some work, but overall comfortable and convenient. The historic character of the hotel gives it some charm. View from restaurant is incredible, especially when there is activity in the zocalo, which is all the time.

<Content>Don't overlook this hotel My fiancee and I spent 6 nights here, and would absolutely stay here again.The noise from the Zocalo is everything that people say it is, to say nothing of the church bells and midddle-of-the-night nearby building alarms, but all in all, the experience was superb. If you stay in room 604 you will find a very firm kingsize bed, with a gorgeous arched window looking out over the main church on the square: it is a view that will stay with us forever. The coffee that they serve at breakfast is often lukewarm, at best, but we found a very simple solution: simply tell your waiter that you want cafe muy caliente - in which case they will generally bring you piping hot coffee. The breakfast buffet is superb, and the steaks for dinner are also excellent quality (even if very thing by American steak house standards). The margaritas were varied, but we found a solution to this problem as well: we snuck our own tequila into them, and added lime which they served at the table anyway. The 7th floor terrace restaurant is the place to be for both breakfast as well as dinner. This hotel really oozes with charm. The stairways, the atrium, the lobby, and the views out the window and over the balcony of the terrace restaurant really cannot be beat. If you stay anywhere else, you're making a mistake, because you will miss the feel of being in the middle of it all and in a building which is filled with charm. The location in the midst of the thousand palaces is also a must, in order to get the feel of the oppulence that once was Mexico City. One important caution though: DO NOT take advantage of the guided tours to the pyramids that can be arranged next to the front desk of the hotel. Either take a taxi or shop around. The pyramids are fantastic and must be seen, but the tour from the hotel is an absolute rip-off: they basically drove us around for half the day and made us wait in junky tourist shops, and then gave us only 60 minutes within which to tour the pyramids, which could easily be a 3 hour visit to enjoy it fully.

<Content>Majestic mediocre I stayed here with my mom and niece for three nights and pretty much agree with the previous reviewers. The hotel is clean and safe, but very noisy if your room faces the Zocalo. I agree withthe previous reviewer that said the food on the terrace is expensive and mediocre, and our coffee was also cold! There are lots of nice little restaurants down the side streets with much better food that are a lot cheaper! Take time to explore the side streets, not only for eating options, but to find good bookstores, (Gandhi) and apparel shops. The best thing the Majestic has going for it is the location.

<Content>Not great While our room was nice and the hotel staff is lovely, facing the Zocalo where traffic never stops was the worst experience. But traffic was not the only problem! Many concerts and demonstrations take place on and around the Zocalo. One night, a rock band played until 3 AM! And they weren't even good! Our beds shook all night and the echo added to the sound of the music was insufferable. If you wish to have a relaxing stay and get a good night's sleep, this is not the place for you. However, if you plan of partying all night and simply using your room to crash, then this is a decent choice. Breakfast is not included and the restaurant on the 7th floor is slightly more expensive than other breakfast joints.

<Content>Classy and elegant, amazing location This was our second stay at the Majestic. The first time we had a room overlooking the Zocolo, which was amazing. We loved having a view of all the activity, including the Mexican flag raising and lowering each day. We had read a review that advised that we bring ear plugs, which we did, and it made our stay much more positive!!On our second visit, most recently, we had a room overlooking a nearby street, and we were disappointed. While it was quieter, we missed the activity of the Zocolo. The room was adequate, not top-notch. The restaurant was adequte, but we won't eat there again. You can get more for the money several blocks away.We did appreciate the staff and their professionalism and respect for their guests. Everything in our room worked, and while another reviewer noted that the elevator was not working on his/her stay, this time it was working fine (although we generally chose to walk up the steps to get some great exercise!). We will likely stay there again, but will make a request for a room facing the zocolo!

<Content>Kind of elegant lobby, but it stops there... Yes, the location is wonderful, the lobby has that 30's Mexican elegance, but that's about all I can say in favor of the Majestic. Room was bland, bed rock hard (arm falling asleep hard...), tiled shelf in shower/bath was filthy (too tall for the short statured cleaning staff to see?), phone didn't work, etc. Husband had stayed here 30+ years ago, when the Zocalo was busy but there were not annoying faux-Axtec dancers beating on drums until 11PM onward. Food unremarkable and expensive ($13 for buffet breakfast offering nothing remarkable, and cold coffee?) Next time, we're definitely staying elsewhere. Left them all this info on the survey form... hopefully someone will pay attention to the honest feedback. We so wanted this to be a good place.. it could be if they hand out ear plugs and coupons to dine elsewhere.Nancy C

<Content>Fantastic Location Stayed in a suite on the second floor. Had a balcony that overlooked the Zocalo. Room was a little dated but that was easily overlooked as the location of the hotel couldn't have been more central to all the numerous sights close by. The roof terrace restaurant was an incredible place to have breakfast in the morning or a nightcap. What a view of the Zocalo! The many reviews given complaining about the noise were somewhat true, but the city has 22 million people, so if you are expecting peace and quiet, maybe Mexico City is not the place for you.

<Content>needs updating but great! I am currently staying here day 4 of 6 The hotel needs an update but it feels right. I'm in one of the rooms on the 6th floor with a balcony and an unbelievable view. The staff has gone out of their way for me more than once and is to be commended for that! If you enjoy old hotels in great locations this is the place for you!

<Content>Magestic indeed! Best Western Majestic is located in the historic district and is directly across from the zocala (town square). Request a room facing the square; there are always activites going on. Best Western did a fantastic job restoring the building to it's original grandeur. The lobby and interior garden/sitting area are stunning. Our room was OK, simple and clean. The staff was welcoming and helpful. A real treat and positive beginning to our two week adventure in central Mexico.

<Content>Great location, but very little else I stayed at the Majestic on the recommendation of an old Bristish gentleman I'd met last year in Mexico City who had lunched at their famous Restaurante La Terraza there sometime during World War Two. He was very nostalgic about the experience. Sadly, I can't share his enthusiasm.The hotel was built in 1937, and time has not been kind to it. The lobby and atrium areas are attractive, as are the hallways with lovely Talavera tile embellishments, but the guest rooms and bathrooms are in dire need of a major renovation. They are shabby and dreary. One of the draperies in my room was hanging precariously. Hot water might or might not be available in the antiquated bathroom. The toilet might or might not flush (although the man with the plunger arrived promptly and solved the problem). The maid might or might not have remembered to place the promised coffee maker in the room, the in-room safe was broken, the clock blinked relentlessly, and the wiring is positively scary. The word firetrap kept floating to the surface of my mind, impinging on what little sleep I was able to get on the cement slab they called a bed, and what sounded either like construction noise or the vigorous activities of poltergeists in the next room didn't add to my feeling of delicious serentiy, especially when the noise continued far into the night.The Terrace Restaurant about which my British friend had spoken so tenderly has a spectacular view of the Zocalo, but that was all there was to recommend it. The food was mediocre, the service was poor and the prices were high. Despite the indifferent service in the dining room, the people at the reception desk and the bellhops who doubled as elevator operators were very pleasant indeed.I won't complain about the general noise as other reviewers have. Mexico City is the largest city in the world, and the Zocalo is one of the biggest squares extant, (second only to Red Square in Moscow, I seem to recall) so no reasonable person would expect it to be as quiet as an undiscovered tomb. A huge number of people congregate in the area around the incredibly beautiful Cathedral and they make a lot of noise. The traffic is non-stop and noisy. The are always sirens. Mysteriously, the Cathedral bells ring, but not when one would expect them to, and at 8:30 AM they begin a very interesting series of responsive rings, seven chimes each from what I guess is each of the bells in the two towers. The Cathedral has a great many bells, but it's a very big cathedral. The Mexican people are intensely patriotic, and there is a large gathering for the raising and lowering the gigantic flag (big enough to carpet Rhode Island) in great ceremonial style at 8:00 AM and again at 6:00 PM in the center of the Zocalo. The ceremony includes a band with plenty of drums and trumpets, soldiers, and military policemen. After the lowering of the flag in the evening, a group of Indians takes over the noise production duties and they drum the same rhythmic pattern far, far into the night. All this being said, I knew the Majestic would include plenty of ambiant city noise, just not construction workers or poltergeists.The hotel has an incredible view on the side facing the Zocalo, and the location is ideal for on-foot exploration of an endless number of fascinating places such as the Cathedral on the north side of the square and the National Palace directly across the square from the hotel which houses spectacular murals by Diego Rivera. About a block north of the National Palace are the ongoing excavations of an ancient Aztec temple, called Templo Mejor. The lovely museum, Palacio de Bellas Artes, is an easy walk about a mile north of the square.The area around the Cathedral presents an unforgettable shopping adventure for almost anything you can imagine. To compensate for the dreadful food at the Majestic, fine dining in the periphery of the Cathedral is a joyous adventure for the pushcart gourmet, and I loved every wonderful bite of everything I bought there. Another plus of eating near the Cathedral is the opportunity to observe a great number of fascinating people going about their daily lives.On my next visit to Mexico City, I intend to stay at the Hotel Catedral, which is a couple of blocks away because I love the central location, but sadly, I've enjoyed just about as much of the Majestic as I can stand.

<Content>Location: that's it! Location, location, location鈥? We were lucky to have a room on the 5th floor with a view over the Z贸calo, and though noisy (could someone do away with the guys pretending to be Aztecs dancing most afternoons with their drums, please!), we wouldn鈥檛 have switched rooms for a second. We had first class view of the hoisting of the giant flag and all other life on the square. The rooms, though, are not up to standard. They are clean, but need a serious refurbishment. Curtains and carpets are holed, the water is seldom hot, and the bathrooms were fine, but obsolete. When we left and asked for a taxi, we were asked to drive with 鈥?someone鈥檚 friend (?). In a city that emphasizes taxi security so much, that is simply not acceptable, and Best Western should definitely not accept the bell boy or reception helping their friend in this way. We will not stay there again, as the hotel generally seemed to be ignorant of security: Their safes in the rooms don鈥檛 work, and reception openly says that they don鈥檛 care. They offer valuables to be kept in the cellar below the reception鈥?br/>

<Content>Ordinary Being located in the Historic Centre with a lovely view of the Catheral this hotel offers some really nice photo opportunites from the roof top restaurant. Unfortunately this is where the positives end, there is simply nothing majestic about this hotel.Arriving late afternoon well past check in, we were shown to a room that was not made up. A simple oversight we thought and left our luggage to explore the city. We returned to find the sheets had not even been changed! (Evident by lip stick marks and hairs...) and the general cleanliness of the room left a lot to be desired. This aside we discovered at night the walls were paper thin, so much so we could hear intimate conversations (and other things) of the visitors in the room to our right and the snoring of the old fellow to the left. At one stage I woke because I thought my husband was coughing but it was the room next door. The bed was so hard sleeping on the floor would have been as comfortable. There was also an exposed power point hanging out of the wall, the only one in the room that you could use to charge a mobile phone or camera and you felt you were taking your life into your own hands to use it. The restaurant food was below par, do not even waste your time with the breakfast, it is over priced and for a buffet there is nothing appealing to choose. We certainly would not return here.

<Content>Find Another Option! Like many other reviewers, we chose this hotel for the location. But we experienced the same problems: LOTS of noise (even with our interior room--you can still hear the sounds of the guests in the courtyard, and through the paper thin walls); no fan or air-conditioning; insufficient towels; bottled water provided only on the first night (we were told it's complimentary upon arrival, but after that you have to buy it--this is unacceptable in a country in which you need purified water to brush your teeth); seriously dingy decor; and a sleazy travel agent at the front desk. The agency set us up with an excellent taxi driver/guide (his name is Miguel), but the charge was astronomical ($1200 pesos for a half day for two people--nearly double what we were originally quoted), and we later learned that the agency pockets half of the fee and treats its employees poorly. Find another place to stay and shop around for a decent deal on tours.

<Content>Good But Not the Only Viable Location in Mex. City The hotel building is an architectural gem, but the management is mediocre, though the non-management staff are friendly. When we arrived, there was no orientation to the hotel or surrounding area---the hotel is right on the Zocalo! Every day, they cleaned to interior courtyard floors with a strong oil-based cleaner that left a pungent smell for hours. The top floor restuarant has a great view of the Zocalo if you happen to get the right table, otherwise, the view is quite restricted. And, the food and drinks are terrible--we had the worst margarita that side of the Rio Grande river we've ever had. Finally, we reported that the maid had not left any bottled water on the 2nd day and were told that water was complementary ONLY for the 1st day and we had to go to the lobby to buy some if we wanted more---how cheap can you get! I left a note for the manager and never got a response. I recommend hotels in the Zona Rosa. Mexico City is easy to traverse by cab or minibuses on Reforma.

<Content>Not recommended! Having spent many months in Mexico over the years, I cannot recommended Hotel Majestic. As others have said, it is noisy and overpriced -- especially noisy. I would add that it is impersonal. Yes, it is in the Centro, near everything, but so are others, particularly Hotel Catedral, which I have used repeatedly on other visits since 1993. I have never repeated Majestic.

<Content>Okay Hotel but well placed for the zocalo Stayed here for two nights. Noisy - expect to be woken from about 5am by people talking, singing etc. Rooms not very big and the bathrooms look like they have the tiling and baths from the 1930's (with not that much maintenance). Has hot water in the bathrooms though! The rooms are clean and there are safes in each room but sometimes no keys!Breakfast is about 50 pesos for a buffet - we didn't sample it but got coffee pastries etc from a 7/11 2 minutes from the hotel. We had dinner one night at the hotel and the food was good and arrived reasonably quickly (for Mexico). The restaurant is on the top floor and looks out onto the Zocalo and gives a good view of it at night whent eh cathedral is lit up.Really in the Zocalo and 10 minutes by foot from the belle artes (where Diego Rivera murals are).

<Content>Interesting and convenient The Majestic is located in an old building right on the Zocalo, and has both inside and outside rooms. I have stayed there many times because I like the convenient location. I always ask for a room high on the outside, but these can be very noisy, as can those rooms on the top floor, just under the good restaurant, where they seem to work 24 hours a day.

<Content>good location - ok rooms Our group got a good rate of $55 per weekend night. The location of the hotel was convenient to many sites such as the zocalo, the Ballet and the metro. The area seemed very safe even at night. The hotel was clean and the staff was very nice. We had two courtyard rooms with 3 single beds in each. The rooms were very spacious by Mexico standards and the bathrooms were huge. There was however no window in the room. The rooms were at the end of the hall, beyond the courtyard, so the opaque glass block window faced a stairway and did not open. There is no airconditioning so with no window it got a bit stuffy. The rooms were very quiet at night however. The third room in our group had a window on the zocalo. It was noisy!!!! The room was smaller with two double beds and a smaller bathroom. I would stay here again because of the location and the pleasant staff and the price was right. I would not get a zocalo room however.

<Content>No peace and quiet!! We stayed at this hotel for two nights originally and had to make reservations before we left the US. The cost was $75.00 per night with no breakfast. They charged our credit card in total when we made the reservation. We then had to change our plans due to airline cancellation (which can be frequently in Mexico), we were unable to make reservations for one more night months in advance. The hotel is very hot, and very, very noisy!!!! No airconditioning or fans and constant protests with drums, music, and constant chaos in the square. We got virtually no sleep at all. The staff was for the most part helpful. All tours had to be paid for in cash and not visa (eventhough there was a credit card terminal clearly present in plain sight). The elevator has to be run by staff due to the age and we had many times we could not get anyone to bring elevator to our floor (the 6th floor, arrghh!!!), so we had to make the trip up or down the flights of stairs. We had to move to a hotel that was about 6 blocks away when we were unable to get the last night there and it was a relief having airconditioning, working elevators, no noise and about 1/2 the cost!!! Also note, Best Western states they are not affiliated with the Majestic any longer when I tried originally to make reservations, guess I know why!I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you enjoy noise! All shops, restarants in the area close early, so not much to do in the evening. The traffic was also tremendous getting into the center of town due to the multiple demonstrations, protests, etc. It took a lot of time just to reach the hotel by taxis.

<Content>Unhappy ending to Oct 2004 stay We have stayed at the Majestic many times. The service staff is very helpful and friendly. The location of the hotel is wonderful for exploring the old part of the city. Always enjoy dining on the rooftop. The room was rather warn and tired. We had requested two rooms facing the square, at least one with a king bed. We had one room facing the side street and one room facing the square--no king bed. The private taxi we used was great--the driver was helpful and very fair on price.Our main complaint is that we had made reservations and received confirmation by e-mail with a quaranteed rate in USD. At check out the rate was in pesos and we did not realize that we had not been given our promised rate. We have tried many times to contact the hotel. Sent e-mails, phone calls, faxes, even through VISA. Because we signed the charge slip at checkout the hotel will not honor the guaranteed rate. We later stayed at another hotel in Mexico City that was much, much better and less money which even included breakfast.It should also be noted that when we contacted Best Western they informed us the hotel is no longer with them.

<Content>Majestic hotel, but noisy surroundings I stayed at the Majestic for 4 nights in January 2005. The service was great and food in the restaurant very good. Views from the exterior rooms are spectacular, of the magnificent Cathedral and the Zocalo with the biggest flag in the world. Also the room was only $65 which was an excellent price for the location. However on the downside this was the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in. As other reviewers of this hotel have pointed out, there is the flag raising ceremony at 0530 with soldiers drumming and barking orders. Then from 0600 demonstrations against the Mayor in the nearby palace commence, with guys ranting into rock concert strength microphones. Next the cathedral starts chiming from around 0830. Throughout the night traffic noise is another disturbance. I moved rooms 3 times, lastly to an interior room (don't book an interior room on the 6th floor as the restaurant cleaning staff above tap about in high heels at 0300!) on the 2nd floor. Slept OK but no view. Only my aunt refused to change rooms as she is an insomniac and didn't sleep anyway! Michael, England.

<Content>Great Price, Service  Unfortunately, the room did look out into the center part of the hotel; had a great view of the bar. But, this type of closed-in feeling is par-for-the-course in Mexico. They thrive on being boxed in.The people were GREAT, helpful, courteous. The location is perfect - right across from the Zocalo. From the top, at the hotel restaurant, is a great view of the cathedral, Mexico City lights, and the Zocolo (lots going on down there to watch from protests, to VW Bug rallys, to Aztec dance lessons - a true gathering place for the people).We paid only $65 per night (US$ in July 2004) and stayed one night - BUT we had to book it online before we left the States. Considering what other hotels on the Zocolo were charging, it was a great deal.I felt safe and even walked around with my son (I'm a woman). There were police officers on many street corners after 9:00 p.m. Only drawback was that the general area closed down at 10:00 so if you're looking for nightlife you won't find it here.

<Content>OK, but will not stay here again - Noisy Spent two days here from 31 jan to 1 february 2005. Booked the room from the hotelservice at the airport. Got a room facing the inside at the 6 floor, but it was still very noisy. The room had a door connection to the room next door, so it felt like the other guests were in my room. Some times during the night there were drilling noise(i think). In the evening there was a lot of noise from the restaurant/bar upstairs.   The location is great, and the people working there were friendly. The tourbus stop is only 150 m from the hotel. Took a private cab from outside the hotel to the airport(recommended by the staff), it cost 130 pesos. The breakfast was included and was ok.   Didn't feel safe in the area at night - but i'm a sceptic :)

<Content>Very Noisy! We had a three room suite right on the Zocalo, which initially looked quite nice, but it turned out to be the noisiest place we had ever stayed! There were people talking on bullhorns in the square until late every night and lots of traffic noises and alarms going off all night, including a car crash one night. There is a flag raising ceremony every morning at 5:45 a.m. (involving drums and bugles) which woke us up every time. Also, the lighting in our suite was very dim for reading at night. It was not a good place despite the fact that the lobby was very beautiful and the staff was nice and helpful. A bellman named Constantino spoke very good English and fixed us up with taxis, including a driver to go to the Pyramids, etc.

<Content>Be Prepared for LOTS of NOISE and NO SLEEP The good part: you are right on the Zocalo, with some rooms offering perfect views thereof. The shower was pretty decent too, and the rooms are nice sized. The hotel itself is beautiful, with blue tile, and a pretty decent restaurant on the roof that is reasonably priced.The bad part: There is an inner courtyard thing-- that means lots of noise that echoes through the hotel. The hotel runs tours that start at 6 or 7 AM. That means that families, and often kids aged 4-17 are running around the hotel screaming at 6 or 7 am. that's really loud and echoes. Lastly, every night on weekends, and some nights on weekdays, there are concerts, drums and other performances in or around the Zocolo. They're really loud. You won't sleep. At all. Unless you're deaf.We got a corporate rate and they hooked us up with a suite, but if we had paid full price, it would have been a total rip off.

<Content>Loved the Majestic The Best Western Majestic was one the most enjoyable hotel stays that I have ever had. My wife and I stayed at the Majestic during our honeymoon (Oct. 31-Nov. 4 2004). The Zocolo view was wonderful and with Dia de los Muertos going on the area was alive with people. The staff was extremely courteous and efficient. I will recommend this hotel to all of my friends.

<Content>Way over priced I was very disappointed with what the hotel had to offer for the price you had to pay. First of all I spent $100 plus a night on a one person room, the rooms really need to be renovated. YOu would think they could afford better for the killing they are probably making with what they charge. I assume alot of what one pays there is for the location, extrememly close to the Zocalo, but I stayed at a hotel for $30 a night closer to business district , later on during my trip and felt I got a better deal with the 30 bucks. I really don't recommend this hotel unless, money is not a problem, you want to be really close to the Zocalo, etc. As for the person who said don't take the green and white taxis, they are find but make sure they have a meter in them, and it defienetly helps to know some Spanish or be someone that knows it, or almost anyone can take advantage of you down there. The Hotels taxi was the run that ripped me off bad, I would think they would be the honest ones, but anyways suit yourself.

<Content>No No "amarse"" On checking in we were shown to an inside room with twin beds. I smiled while encircling my wife's waist sayin NO! No! Amarse! The bell hop smiled, called the desk  we were soon in a room at the top of the hotel with a fantastic view of the Zocalo. Rooms a bit plain, but very clean. Had all the extras I need, hair dryer, wall safe, host bar at prices even I could afford ect. The one draw back was that we were right under the dance floor of the night club, but it closes very early so was not a real problem. We spent New Years eve first on the roof, than in our room watching the incredible action on the Zocalo. Our room had a balcony, but was very small with a low low railing. It was a straight drop of a 100' plus so we kept the doors open, bu did not venture on it. I see that another reviewer belayed the lack of dining in the area. We did not find this true. Our number one find was Cicero Centenario, a 5 star eatery in a old colonial mansion just a few blocks away. Several different groups of musicians strolled through the various dining rooms. The food  service could not be better. Our bill for a 5 course dinner (my wife had 3 glasses of vino) with tip was $38.00 US. Best value I have ever found in Mecico. We walked back to the Majestic, but best to call a cab. Anyways a good hotel with a great location  a Great Dining find at Cireros!

<Content>Weekend on the Zocalo First of all, this hotel is at the heart of the city -- it sits right on the Zocalo, the 2nd largest (after Req Square) public square in the world. As you look out at the Zocalo, you're at the edge of Mexico's history -- the Templo Mayor of the Aztecs, the Spanish colonial cathedral, the swearing in of presidents, a few limited revolutions, and everything else that matters in Mexico.Second, it's well staffed, well run, efficient, and relatively friendly (for a big city hotel, in particular). It provides personalized attention if you need it, and the staff leaves you alone if that's what you want.The rooms are good value (not surprisingly, negotiable rates, especially during this New Depression). We were most recently there in June 2003.A suggestion: go for the weekend, when downtown is less crowded, and the air is markedly better (fewer cars downtown). Be sensible (don't wander around outside drunkenly, and don't take the green VW taxis) and enjoy being at the heart of a great City.

<Content>Great in the historic center! The Best Western Majestic, in the historic district in Mexico City, is a lovely old hotel and a good value. The lobby is beautifully restored and many rooms have been recently updated. My room overlooked the Zocalo, with the Metropolitan Cathedral to the left and the Government Palace across the plaza. Next to the Cathedral is the excavation of the Templo Mayor with its excellent museum.I had heard reports of noise but found the room relatively quiet, especially for a city hotel. Service was excellent. Good restaurants are nearby, including Sanborn's at the House of Tiles and Tacuba, a few blocks away. A metro station is located in the Zocalo and is very user friendly.

<Content>Wished it were better... The lobby and hallways of this hotel are truly gorgeous, which makes the very plain guest rooms something of a letdown. The staff are friendly and helpful. Rather than asking whether we would prefer a Zocalo or Courtyard view the desk clerk simplified the choice as Noisy or Quiet. I definitely recommend the rooftop restaurant, not for its competent food but for the amazing view of the zocalo and the cathedral. If it all becomes too much this is a great place to retreat to. Come admire the lobby, enjoy the view from the restaurant, but stay somewhere else where you can get a better value for your money. My review is admittedly colored by the following: It was quite warm during our visit, prompting us to leave our window open all night. I was awakened by a buzzing insect during the night and in the morning found both myself and my husband covered from literally head to toe in red bites that eventually became very itchy. We looked like we had smallpox. After changing hotels we had no more insect problems.

<Content>Best Western Majestic Hotel In August of 2002, my wife and I stayed at the Best Western Majestic Hotel. Overall, we were impressed with the building's appearance and the staff. The hotel is very well maintained and the lobby and restuarant were in fine shape. The staff could not have been more helpful or pleasant. However, the room did show its age somewhat. The room was clean and certainly did not want for anything, but the bathroom and the furniture probably date back to the beginnings of the hotel. We dined at the hotel's restuarant for both dinner and breakfast, and both meals were outstanding. I would reccommend eating there because the food is good, and the view of the Historic Center is unbeatable. The hotel's location is very convenient for exploring the this part of the city. During the day, there are a lot of places to see. However, at night, there are few places to eat or visit in the Historic Center, and I would recommend either staying in the hotel or taking a hotel taxi somewhere else.
